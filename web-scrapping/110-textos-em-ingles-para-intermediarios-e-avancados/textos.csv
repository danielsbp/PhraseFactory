One Monday afternoon, Mike, adopting a very unusual style, wore a hoody.
Nobody would ever think of wearing a hoody on a very hot day.
His friends also wondered why he was being weird.
They became a little aloof with Mike that day.
The next day, Mike wore a hoody again, this time of a different color.
This went on every day for a week and his friends gradually got used to it.
Finally, on the eighth day, Mike wore a plain white shirt, acting like nothing had been amiss for the past week.
One of his friends asked him, “Are you finally done with your hoody fashion?” “What hoody fashion?” Mike asked.
“Last week, everyday, you kept on wearing a hoody.
” And then Mike said, “What? I was on vacation last week.
I just got home this morning.
George doesn’t like sickness.
He doesn’t want to take medicine or go to the doctor.
He does not want to catch any disease, especially Swine Flu.
He hates sneezing, coughing, a runny nose, and watery eyes.

He became so paranoid that he decided to quit his job and just stayed home all the time.
He resorted to an online job.

One fine day, Mr.
George went to his friend, Mr.
Carter to ask for a favor.
“Can I borrow $1,000 from you, my friend?” Mr.
“Sure, you can.
You know you are one of my friends,” Mr.
George’s face lit up upon hearing his friend’s response.
He had been trying to borrow money from other colleagues to pay for his daughter’s hospitalization.
“I know from the look on your face that you are facing a big problem” Mr.
“I wanted to help a good friend and ease his trouble.
Money is just a piece of paper used to buy and pay for things.
Friendship is greater and more important,” he further stated.
“I thank God I have a friend like you, Carter,” Mr.
George uttered, so thankful that he shed a tear.
One day, Hannah approached her father while he was repairing their truck.
She had seen that the truck was loaded with logs from the woods.
She remembered something she had seen on the news.
The woods are home to wild animals.
But trees had been getting scarce due to unsustainable logging.
Hannah asked her father, “Dad, are you happy with our home?” The father was quite shocked by the question, but he managed to answer, “Yes, dear.
Why do you ask?” Hannah replied, “If people tried to destroy our house, would you be mad?” Hannah’s father was taken aback but responded, “Yes, my dear.
But I won’t let it happen.
” Hannah gave her father a sad look and said, “But you are destroying the animals’ homes by cutting the trees in the woods.

After breakfast, she asked my older brother if he could drive for her.
My brother nodded as if he knew already where they were heading.
My grandmother went upstairs to get ready.

Peter got out of bed feeling sad.
He was tired of living and wanted to die.
He would even ask people around him to help him die.
They made suggestions, because they thought he was joking.
One said that he should overdose on medicine; the other simply offered him a noose.
Peter was not satisfied with their answers.
Then, Peter asked Sarah.
Sarah was pretty and always smiling to everyone she talked to.
She even talked to Peter, who was usually gloomy.

Today is my birthday, and I’m excited to go to school.
My mom cooked a delicious breakfast for me.
My sister hugged me this morning and told me to enjoy my day.
My brother gave me two action figures of my favorite superheroes and it made me happy.
Dad left early for work today, and I am wondering what he is going to give me when he gets back.
On my last birthday, he gave me a new smartphone.
After school, I’m excited to go home and see dad.
I saw him waving at me in front of our house and I ran up to him as fast as I could.
He gave me a bag.
I noticed that it was quite heavy, so he helped me open it.
Then, I saw the gift I had always wanted.
It was pink, and my name was inscribed on it.
My dad gave me a cool laptop– the coolest ever.
I woke up this morning not wanting to go to class.
I told myself that being late would be okay since our first class would be Physical Education.
We just play games the whole time, and my teacher would not notice if I come early or late.
I stayed in bed for a couple of minutes.
I even ate my breakfast slowly.
I walked to school at a tortoise’s pace.
I saw my classmates and my teacher at the gym playing volleyball.
I quietly slipped in and joined the cheering crowd.
I noticed that my teacher was looking at me.
I smiled at him and pretended to have been there since the start of class.
After the class, he approached me.
“You are an hour late to my class.
Do ten pushups” he ordered.
The dead bodies he kept are hidden in his empty basement.
Any moment, she would arrive.
Just then, the doorbell rang.
“Come in,” he said while urging his visitor to relax.
He thought that she was so pretty in that white dress, but it’s a shame that it’s going to be tainted the moment he’d lay his fingers on her.
She was suspicious of him.
This was only their 2nd date.
When he went to the kitchen, she saw him hiding a knife.
She ran towards the basement and stumbled on a pile of plastic bags.
She retched at the smell of the rotting corpses inside it.
However, there was only one thing she could do to hide.
She buried herself beneath the bodies and prayed that he wouldn’t see her.
He didn’t and she eventually escaped while thinking how lucky she was to have been able to hide under the bodies.
One morning, my mother woke me up and told me that my Aunt Zeny and her children were downstairs.
They came to invite us for a swim at the beach.
The beach is just an hour away from our place, so my mom decided to go with them.
My mom helped me prepare my bag.
We did not cook any food since we would buy snacks on the way.
I could see my cousins’ excitement as we headed towards the beach.
I was excited, too.
However, I am afraid of the water and can’t swim.
All of my cousins hurriedly went to the shore as we arrived.
I panicked a little, but I saw my mother staring at me.
She was smiling at me.
It was like she was telling me to, “Go ahead son, and learn to swim.
My little brother can’t swim.
My family went to the beach once and he just sat on the sand watching us swim.
I told him he won’t enjoy the beach until he learns to swim.
I decided I would teach him.
The first lesson was how to stay afloat.
I pulled him towards the water and told him to relax.
To stay afloat, you need to kick the water and use your hands.
He kicked and used his hands but would not float.
Again, I told him to relax.
He kicked and used his hands.
Finally, he was able to stay afloat.
The next lesson was how to move through the water.
Our mother called us and said it was time to go home.
I told my brother we would continue the next time our family goes to the beach.
I met a real estate agent once.
He told me he could help me find my dream house.
I followed him to where he said it was.

It was very expensive.
I could not afford it.
I tried to negotiate but he wouldn’t.
He said that house prices go up over time and I should buy the house now.
I told him I did not have enough money.
I called my wife and asked her to come see the house.
She arrived within the hour and saw the house.
She loved it! I told her about the price.
She looked at me and smiled.
My wife paid for the house.

He is the pier.

He put on a freshly laundered black coat and his new black shiny shoes.
He looked at himself once, twice, and thrice in the mirror just to make sure everything was perfect.
He hurriedly hopped in his car and drove to his favorite flower shop to pick a fresh bouquet of red roses.

His father was sick and could no longer work.
He had five other siblings to take care for and to feed.
While looking around, he stumbled upon one post that caught his attention.

He asked the supervisor, “Sir, what job would be available for me after the training?” The supervisor replied, “What job? We only have job training, but no job.

My son is currently in fourth grade.
Since he entered school, I have never seen him this excited to go to school and do all his homework.
I have seen the huge difference from what he was before to what he has become now.
I am happy to see that he is interested in his studies now.
I can see that his grades are different, too.
He seems driven, to tell stories about what happens at school, especially about the teacher, Miss Aimee.
Then, on Valentine’s day, he makes a card with a big red heart and signs it: To Teacher.
That’s when I know Miss Aimee has a special place in his heart.
I smile knowing he still has much to learn about love, but he’s probably getting his first lesson from his fourth grade teacher.

He has ideas but doesn’t welcome other people’s views.

After school, Alice played with her sister.
She shared, “Bears are one of the animals that go into deep sleep.
It is called hibernation.
It is their special way to adapt to the season.

They do this to reserve their energy.

” She responded, “Bears eat lots of food and store it, so they can use it slowly during their hibernation.
” Alice added, “From now on, I will eat lots of food and store it, so I can sleep all day in winter, too.

Do not disturb the others.
You need no help from any co-worker.

She finds herself speechless.

She is in the process of bag inspection, and she feels nervous all of a sudden.
The police officer gets near the guard who is inspecting her bags.
The guard is stopped and checked.
The police officer finds a small smidge of powdered drug hidden on his ring.
Jill, on the other hand, has a new topic for her blog.
It’s 4am and he hasn’t packed yet.
His flight is 6am.
He’s obviously going to be late for it, but he tries anyway.

He goes to his bathroom and packs his toothbrush, medicines, and facial wash.
Lastly, he goes to the kitchen, and grabs his favorite snacks.
He hurriedly rides a taxi and tells the driver to drive fast.
When he arrives at the airport, it’s already 5:30am.

Kriselda loves her boyfriend Edward very much.
She has butterflies in her stomach every time she thinks about him.
The day is not complete without seeing him.
Edward is the only person who makes her feel that way.
Edward seems to feel the same way.
So, they decide to live together.
Kriselda is excited.
She can imagine them sharing breakfasts together and cuddling every night.
Her dream with Edward is finally coming true.
They have everything transferred and unpacked in their new apartment.
They enjoy their first week together.
But as time soon passes, Kriselda discovers Edward’s nasty snoring.

The phone has finally rung.
Missy has been trying to contact the postal office since this morning.
She thinks they are incredibly busy.
The customer support picks the phone up and asks what he can do for her.
She says she hasn’t received the package she’s supposed to have yesterday.
She discovers that there has been confusion at the post office due to the large number of consumers.
Missy is slightly annoyed.
However, she politely asks for USPS redelivery.
The man on the other end of the line tells her that it can be done.
She can expect the package to come on Friday.
Missy will have to wait for another 3 days.
Three days after, her package still hasn’t been delivered.
It’s when Missy truly gets angry.
The post office is incredibly busy.
It’s a holiday.
They are receiving more delivery and redelivery requests than usual.
To make matters worse, their five delivery men decide to hold a strike and boycott work.
They have to find someone to replace them.
The manager says it’s impossible to hire new workers right away.
They decide to pull two people from customer support and two from the technical staff to manage the deliveries for the meantime.
However, the new delivery men often get lost and a lot of packages are delivered wrongly.
All the staff is panicking.
A lot of customers are already complaining.
The manager wonders if they’ll be facing closure soon.
He sighs as he wonders how their delivery men dared leave them at the busiest time of the year.
Last year, the USPS got a new manager.
He is strict and most of the employees secretly hate him.
Perhaps, the people who hate him the most are the five delivery men.
Mike, Jess, Norman, Jay, and Kool have worked on the postal office for 3-6 years.
However, they have never been under such strict management.
They get reprimanded even if they’re only a minute late in their delivery.
They also get a warning when they miss a package and have to redeliver it.
Last month, they had not received their payment on time.
When they raised this concern with the manager, he simply said that they have no right to complain as they rarely worked during that month.
Fed up with the new management, the five delivery men decide to boycott work this holiday.
Jess is walking home one afternoon when he’s almost hit by a motorcycle.
He’s so shocked that he trips up.
The motorcycle stops and the driver comes closer to him.
He’s about to say sorry.
However, he shouts Jess’ name instead, “Jess! Where have you been? Come back to the post office.
We’re a mess, man.
I have to redeliver so many packages that I don’t know where to start.
” Jess recognizes the man as Godo, one of their technical staff.
He’s curious why he’s doing the delivery himself, but does not ask.
Godo adds, “Are you sure you want to quit your job? It’s hard to find work nowadays, man.
You’ll regret it when you have nothing more to eat.
” Jess knows this.
However, his pride will never allow him to go back to USPS.
He’d rather starve.

Luckily, he never had reason to fly before.
Later that day, he goes to work.
His boss calls him to the office.
He’s afraid he has done something wrong.
He keeps thinking, but he’s sure he has met all the deadlines and has done them well.
Slowly, he opens the door.
The boss tells him to sit down.
He has this stern look that made Stephen more afraid.
Finally, his boss says, “You need to fly to Los Angeles.
We have a project there that you need to manage.
” The color drains from Stephen’s face.
