It is so passionate and true.
Her friends don’t understand why she likes that movie so much, but she doesn’t care.
She watches it by herself, with popcorn in her bed.

Another of my friends started to be very sick.
We will never know if it was caused by the cake or the food my mother cooked that day, but that friend of mine started to vomit a lot.

Happily, he was fine because we took him to the hospital.
Overall though, that birthday was an awful one.

When you get to the beach, you have to choose the best spot.
The best spot is under the shade and not too far from the water.
If possible, a chair is the best option.
Otherwise, the towel can also be on the ground.
Then, all there is left to do is to enjoy yourself.

Some people like to play sports like beach volleyball.
It’s a good way to meet new people.
Overall, going to the beach is always fun.

He had all the CDs from the Beatles as well as their vinyl.
Also he had all the CDs of the RollingStones.
In total, he had over 550 CDs.
He was a real fan.
Perhaps his favorite kind of music was old rock.
Whenever someone would ask him though, he would be confused.
It was hard for him to tell because he liked them all.
The only thing he didn’t like was heavy metal because it was too loud for him.
Oliver is confused.
Lately, he has been thinking a lot.
What are friends? Does he have friends? He thinks that whenever he is not doing well, no one is there for him.
People seem not to care.
He doesn’t know if these are really considered as friends then.
But what are friends anyway? Some people say it’s like a family you choose.
Oliver doesn’t know where he stands.
He doesn’t know if the people he calls as friends are really friends.
He doesn’t think he considers them as a family.
They are just good company.
They are not people he can count on.
They are not people he trusts.
He doesn’t share too many things with them.
All they do is play video games together.
Maybe he should try to meet new friends.
Perhaps he needs better people in his life.
All these questions are haunting Oliver.
He is hoping that one day, he is going to get all the answers he is looking for.

First of all, he writes a little description of himself.
Second of all, he uploads a picture of himself.
Then, he waits for girls to write to him.
After two weeks, no one wrote to Oscar.
He doesn’t understand why.
He thinks he has a good profile and described himself perfectly.
Then, while looking at his profile correctly, he realized that he made a mistake.
He didn’t post a good picture of himself.
The picture he uploaded was an old picture of himself when he used to weigh 35 pounds more.
That’s the problem with online dating sites.
People only look at the pictures.
They don’t really care about the description.
As soon as he changed the picture, he started to get invitations.
That just proved his point.
People only look at the pictures, just like If it was online shopping.

Jacky loves to change her hair color once in a while.
She thinks that it is part of her personality.
Last year, her hair was blond with some purple highlights.
Now, they are black, but she is getting bored with this color.
She wants to try something new.
She goes to her hairdresser and she asks to get her hair dyed blond again, but she wants them to be so pale that they almost look white or gray.
She read in a magazine that it is really trendy.
Actually, her favorite actress’ hair is like this and she loves it.
Her hairdresser is unsure about the idea.
She never dyed anyone’s hair so pale before but she is willing to try.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t come out as expected.
It looks green.
At first, Jacky is mad, but then, she thinks the color looks good on her.
After all, maybe green is a good color.
Her hairdresser offers to do it again, but Jacky doesn’t care anymore.
She loves her green hair.
“Green hair,don’t care!”.
It was on a Saturday night in July.
I was on a fishing boat with friends on the ocean, a couple of kilometers away from the shore.
The weather was pleasant, but it didn’t last too long.
Suddenly, it started to rain.
At first, it was only a soft little rain, but in only a couple of minutes, it started to rain heavily.
Then, lightning started.
Everyone on the boat including me started to be scared.
The waves were becoming higher and higher, stronger and stronger.
We were facing an aggressive storm.
We tried to call for some help, but it was not working.
No one was responding.
We didn’t have much of a choice anymore; all we had left to do was to wait for the storm to pass.
It took around 3 hours.
It was terrible.
My day on the ocean was ruined.
At least, we got back to shore safe and sound and we had time to catch some fish.

He is a student at a college located far from his hometown.
The boys at his college all play Basketball.
It’s not really Jules’ thing.
The other boys don’t understand why and try to convince him to play with them.

They keep on changing things though.
Last summer, they built a pool.
Two years ago, they changed the floors.
This year, they want to enlarge one balcony and they want to change the kitchen counters to put in marble.
All of these changes are really great, but they are really worried.
It’s increasing the home value and they are not sure if this is a good idea.
What if they have difficulties selling the house later because the value is too high compared to other houses in the neighborhood? Charles is trying to be realistic and he thinks they should stop changing things.
Brittany doesn’t want to stop because she likes to improve the way her house looks.
They agree to change some things this year and then to stop for at least two more years.
After that, they will see what they should do.
Lynn isn’t a fan of paintball, but when her friend Tommy suggested playing it in the city streets, she got intrigued.
She played once on a court which she didn’t like much, but playing in the city streets seems very fun.
Tommy and Lynn decide to try it together.
They subscribe to the activity as a team.
It’s organized by one of Tommy’s friends.
The streets are closed to the public.
It’s only for people playing paintball.
It is very fun because you can hide behind buildings.
It’s difficult though because the playground is very wide.
It’s difficult to find people.
The game lasted 2 hours, which seems long, but it wasn’t really.
Time flew by very quickly.
Tommy and Lynn are now covered in different colors like yellow and green.
They took a lot of pictures as a souvenir and they laughed a lot.
They will probably participate next year if the activity is still going on.

The man could see she read the message so he was being insistent.
Izabella decided to reply.
She told him that she was busy and that she wasn’t interested in talking with him.

Izabella started to be scared so she turned off her Facebook.
The next morning, the conversation was gone which was really odd.
Maybe it was only a dream? Izabella will never know how it happened and who it was, but that night really scared her.

She has been single for quite a long time now, but she is happy with her situation.
She is not looking for a man.
Whenever someone tries to flirt with her, she always stays cold, especially when they start telling her things about themselves.
She likes to simply reply “Oh, Really?”, in a sarcastic way, because she doesn’t care.
If a boy tells her he has a car, she is going to say “Oh, Really?”.
When another one tells her he has money, she will answer the same.
Basically, she is never impressed by what boys tell her.
She hopes one day one man will be interested in her and will ask questions about her instead of just talking about himself.
Then maybe she will stop being so sarcastic.
Maybe she will start showing that she is interested.
So far though, it doesn’t seem like it is going to happen anytime soon.

At least, that’s what his friend, another neighbor, told him.
One day, he hears a loud noise coming from her place.
Thinking she might be in danger, Erik spontaneously decides to knock on the girl’s door.

It was a once in a lifetime kind of experience!.

Tonight, he is going to the casino with his wife Jenny.
It’s the first time he is going there, but Jenny has been there a couple of times before.
He can already picture himself winning thousands of dollars.
He already knows what he would do with all that money.
He would go for a trip to Jamaica.
When he got to the casino, he felt confused.
He is not sure how it works.
Where is he supposed to get the free coins to play? Jenny had to tell him that there were no free coins.
He has to give money to get the coins and then only he could go play.
Vikas thinks this is completely wrong.
Why would he pay to win? He thought he could play for free.
Jenny thinks this is a little funny.
How can Vikas think such a thing? Of course, paying to win is the main idea of casinos.
Embarrassed, Vikas decided to play anyway, but only with 20$.
Audrey and Mary, two coworkers, are thinking about going out for lunch today, but they don’t know where to go to.
Audrey proposed a new sushi restaurant, but Mary is not a fan of seafood.
She proposed instead to go to an Italian place, but Audrey had some pastas yesterday for dinner, so she would like something different.
Unsure about what to do, the two girls decide to look in the local newspaper to see if there is any deal.
Luckily, there was one interesting deal.
There was a restaurant offering a “two for one” lunch.
Basically, if they were paying for one lunch, they would get one free.
Excited by the idea, the two girls choose to go to this place.
Audrey had salmon and Mary had pizza.
The food was delicious! Everything was going perfectly, until it was time to pay.
When they saw the bill, they thought there must be a mistake.
It was more expensive than it was supposed to be.
When Audrey asked the waiter about the free lunch deal, he simply replied: “there’s no such thing as free lunch”.
Confused, the two coworkers paid the total amount of the bill and left.

Taylor was coming back from work, tired and exhausted.
He had a long day and he was looking forward to relaxing.
It was impossible for him to expect what was about to happen though.
When he got home, there it was, on the balcony: a baby goose.
Confused, he called his wife.
“What’s up with the goose?” He asked.
Why was there a baby goose on his balcony? That made no sense.
His wife explained that she found the baby goose in the street, really hurt.
Since she is a veterinarian, she knew she had to do something.
She knew she had to do what’s good for the goose.
She took him home to take care of him until he gets better.
She promises Taylor that he will always stay on the balcony and he will never get inside the house.
Although Taylor is unsure about the idea, he agrees with his wife; they have to do what’s good for the goose.
Otherwise, the poor animal would die.
Taylor finally accepted.

The other day, she got a new pair of shoes worth 100$ that she paid only 2$ for, a new hat from the 60s, some porcelain tea cups from Taiwan and an old sofa which looks perfect in her living room.
Last week, she found a genuine leather coat for only 5$, a pashmina from India for 3$ and an antique guitar.
Some people don’t understand her passion for thrift stores, but she believes this is only because they don’t know all of the great things you can find over there.

Some people use graffiti as vandalism and paint on walls illegally.
That’s what Tom used to do for years.
Actually, even if it was considered a bad thing to do, Tom would always do it to improve the look of a place, or a wall.
That was still vandalism, but in his head, that was art.
When his friend Kathy offered him to paint a mural in front of the new jazz bar she was owning, Tom was happy and deeply grateful.
She knew he had a lot of talent but he just never had the chance to express it in another form than vandalism.
No one ever gave him a chance before her.
For a couple of weeks, he tried to do a sample on a piece of paper of what he wanted to paint.
He was never satisfied though and it was getting really frustrating.
Kathy knew he was feeling pressure so she suggested that he should just start painting directly on the wall and let his inspiration come, which he did.
The mural turned out to be Tom’s most beautiful piece of art.

Within a couple of days, he gets hundreds of followers which makes him very happy.
Barbara doesn’t like Mondays.
She loves the weekends where she can stay at home and enjoy the company of her best friends.
On Mondays, she has to go to school which she hates.
She has to go to classes from 8 o’clock until 11 and then from 6 to 9.
The only thing she likes about Mondays are the afternoons.
Indeed, that is when she plays volleyball classes at the school’s gymnasium with her friends.
That’s the only moment of the week where she has the chance to enjoy some sport.
Otherwise, she is always too busy working or studying.
That is why when Monday afternoons come, although it means the weekend is over, she is happy.
After her volleyball classes though, she gets bored again knowing she has to go to school classes.
If only she could play volleyball all day long and not only during the afternoon, then maybe she would like Mondays.
Veronica wants to cook some chicken for dinner tonight, but she doesn’t have all the ingredients for the recipe.
She decides to go to the supermarket.
She writes down a list of the things she needs and she leaves for some shopping.
When she gets there, she gets a little nervous.
There are a lot of people and the checkout lines are very long.
She hopes she will not be staying here for too long.
She starts her shopping in the vegetable and fruit aisle and then she goes to the meat aisle.
When she sees the price of the chicken, she decides to change her mind.
It is way too pricey.
She is a little confused now because she doesn’t know what to cook anymore.
She continues her shopping, still thinking about tonight’s dinner.
When she gets in front of the pasta aisle, it gives her a good idea.
She is going to cook some macaroni, her husband Max’s favorite dish.
She gets everything she needs and then she leaves.
Jenna is a professional cook and today is her first day in a new restaurant.
She is very excited, but also nervous because she doesn’t want to get late for her first day.
She has to be there at 8 o’clock and it is already 7.
She is not ready yet and she is unsure how she should go to work.
She is thinking maybe it is too late to take her car.
She might get stuck in traffic and then for sure, she will be late.
The same thing will happen if she calls a taxi.
Instead, she thinks she should take the metro.
She gets dressed quickly; she grabs some coffee and a sandwich from the coffee shop down the road and gets in the next metro going towards the direction of the restaurant.
Time is running out and she is getting more and more anxious.
When the doors open to the metro station, she starts running.
Happily, she arrives right on time for her first day.
