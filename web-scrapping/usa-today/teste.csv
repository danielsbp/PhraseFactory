The 2024 election cycle has kicked off
 Though Election Day is over a year away, the race is well underway
 President Joe Biden announced he will seek another term, and with former President Donald Trump's hat also in the ring, a rematch of their 2020 race is a real possibility
 Though the Democratic establishment is expected to fall firmly behind Biden, the Republican side is more of a toss-up
 Trump-endorsed candidates suffered in the midterm elections, and with his legal troubles mounting, the GOP may consider other options
 Polls still show Trump with a strong lead however, and many of those trying to unseat him have floundered including Florida Gov
 Ron DeSantis
 That dynamic was on full display at the first GOP debate which Trump skipped but still managed to loom over
DeSantis who generated early buzz has suffered in the polls, struggling to translate popularity in Florida to popularity at the national level, and recently firing much of his campaign staff in a major shake-up
Here are the latest developments on the path to the 2024 election: And here are the candidates who have announced their intention to run for president in the 2024 election: Joe Biden ∣ Robert F
 Kennedy Jr
 ∣ Marianne Williamson ∣ Ryan Binkley ∣ Doug Burgum ∣ Chris Christie ∣ Ron DeSantis ∣ Larry Elder ∣ Nikki Haley ∣ Will Hurd ∣ Asa Hutchinson ∣ Perry Johnson ∣ Mike Pence ∣ Vivek Ramaswamy ∣ Tim Scott ∣ Francis Suarez ∣ Donald Trump ∣ Cornel WestPolitical party: DemocratAge: 80cFamily: Biden has spoken candidly about grief throughout his political career

 His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were injured in the crash but survived
 In 2015, Biden lost Beau to brain cancer and has made it a major political goal to champion cancer research
He remarried in 1977, tying the knot with now-First Lady Jill Biden
 The two share a daughter, Ashley, and a large clan of grandchildren
Biden's son Hunter has been the subject of scandal in recent years and has written about his struggles with drug addiction
 The GOP-led House has seized on Hunter's business dealings, hosting hearings to investigate his finances and the potential influence he has on his father
Previous political experience: Joe Biden is a veteran of the Senate
 First elected in 1972, he served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected as vice president on the Obama ticket in 2008
After serving two terms as vice president, Biden took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020
His views: Biden's campaign is focused on the "battle for the soul of America," doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago
 He said the question facing the nation is "whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer

 She has one daughter, India Emmanuelle, whose father has not been publicly identified
Previous political experience: Williamson is a self-help author and spiritual leader who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020
 Then she was largely drowned out by a crowded Democratic field, breaking through for a rare viral moment, but eventually written off as a non-traditional candidate whose views involved centering the "politics of love" and rejecting a “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred
”Her views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans
 She has suggested creating a U
S
 Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy, and a U

 He says he wants to stand out in a crowded field by prioritizing unity, and leaning on his faith and business experience
His views: Binkley has said he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform, and putting more community emphasis on education
 Binkley is against abortion
 Though he signed a highly restrictive bill in his own state, he had indicated he would not do the same nationally and it should be a local issue
 Binkley advocates for American energy independence using an "all of the above" approach that encompasses both fossil fuels and new technologies

His views: Burgum has emphasized economic issues, rather than hot-button cultural issues that have been a focal point for some other GOP candidates
 He is a vocal supporter of the oil industry, and the U
S
 role in exporting it to other nations, and has said he favors smaller government and lower taxes

S
 Navy as a JAG officer, later deploying to Iraq for active duty
 Prior to his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018
  He is widely viewed as Trump’s biggest threat in the Republican primary
 Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to the former president
His views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida
 He is in favor of "defending parental rights and eliminating CRT," and is anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment
Political party: RepublicanAge: 70Family: Elder has no children and has been married once
 The couple divorced after two years and Elder was engaged again to Alexandra Datig from 2013 to 2015

Previous political experience: Elder is a lawyer and conservative talk show host who mounted a campaign against California governor Gavin Newsom in 2021's recall election
 Though he lost, Elder received the highest number of votes of any candidate besides Newsom

 We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there
 That’s why I’m running for President

Previous political experience: Haley started her political career in the South Carolina state legislature where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful campaign for the governor's office in 2010
 She won reelection in 2014 and has bragged that she has "never lost a race
"In 2016, former President Trump nominated Haley to be U
S
 Ambassador to the United Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down in 2018
 Haley has played up her role as a female candidate in what is expected to be a largely male primary field
 "May the best woman win,” she quipped in an interview with Fox News
Her views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel
 She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and "getting tough" on China and Russia
 She has supported Trump in the past but also criticized him after the Jan
 6, 2021, Capitol attack
Political party: RepublicanAge: 45Family: Hurd wed Lynlie Wallace, a fellow political operative, in 2022
 The two first met in 2009
Previous political experience: A former CIA officer, Hurd served three terms in Congress representing Texas in the House after first being elected in 2014
His views: Hurd stands out from an increasingly crowded GOP field as a rare vocal critic of Trump
 He joins the likes of Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson in publicly disavowing the former president and in his campaign launch video listed illegal immigration, inflation, crime, and homelessness as legislative priorities
Political party: RepublicanAge: 72Family: Hutchinson has been married to wife Susan since 1973
 The two share four children and seven grandchildren
Previous political experience: Hutchinson has had a long career in Republican politics

Party: RepublicanAge: 63Family: Pence wed wife Karen in 1985 and the two share three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey
Previous political experience: Pence entered politics in 2000 when he won his local congressional seat
 He went on to serve six terms in the House of Representatives before being sworn in as governor of Indiana in 2013
In 2016, Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate, and he served one term as Vice President
 The role thrust him into a precarious situation in 2021 when Trump sought to pressure him to throw out some of Biden's electoral votes to overturn the election
Pence ultimately defied Trump and certified the results, infuriating MAGA voters and Trump himself
 His candidacy will likely involve a difficult tightrope walk as he attempts to distance himself from the former president without alienating the base
His views: Pence is a vocal opponent of abortion, and of what he sees as the nation's long-term debt problem
 He favors cuts in government spending and lower taxes, and while he often touts his time as vice president and speaks well of the policies that came out of the Trump White House, he has begun to distance himself from his former running mate in terms of tone
 He has also criticized Trump's actions during the Jan
 6, 2021 riot at the U
S
 Capitol

 Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron
Trump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency
 Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr
 and Eric were often cited as close advisors
Previous political experience:  When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to "drain the swamp
"Prior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five
 However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in "The Apprentice
"In 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race
 He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid
His views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats
 He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website

 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud

WASHINGTON − Democratic Sen
 Bob Menendez said Monday he expects to be exonerated and will remain as New Jersey's senior senator after the southern district of New York indicted the New Jersey lawmaker Friday alleging charges of corruption and bribery
Menendez said during a news conference in Union City, New Jersey, that those who have called for his resignation have based judgements off a "limited set of facts
""I understand how deeply concerning this could be, however the allegations leveled against me are just that, allegations," he said
Menendez addressed each of the charges listed in the indictment that allege he and his wife accepted bribes of cash, gold, mortgage payments and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for enriching the Egyptian government
"I firmly believe that when all of the facts are presented, not only will I be exonerated, but I still will be New Jersey's senior senator," he said
The New Jersey lawmaker reiterated his record with Egypt and said he has held the country accountable for human rights abuses, repression of its citizens and more
Menendez allegedly passed along "highly sensitive" information about staffers at the U
S
 Embassy in Cairo, according to the indictment
 Menendez also exerted "substantial influence" over military financing to Egypt, according to the indictment
In regard to the hundreds of thousands of dollars FBI agents found when executing a search warrant at his home, Menendez said he often withdraws thousands of dollars of cash from his personal savings account to keep for emergencies
Having stepped down as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after being indicted, he said he plans to return to Washington this week to work with his colleagues to avert a looming government shutdown
"For those who have rushed to judgment, you have done so based on a limited set of facts, framed by the prosecution to be as salacious as possible
 Remember, prosecutors get it wrong sometimes
 Sadly, I know that," he said during the news conference
Menendez is also accused of interfering with a New Jersey attorney general’s investigation of a relative of a New Jersey businessman, who is a co-defendant in the indictment, as well as attempting to influence the federal prosecution of another Garden State businessman, another co-defendant
 Friday's indictment marks the second time in 10 years the New Jersey lawmaker has been indicted
The New Jersey lawmaker was previously indicted in 2015 when prosecutors alleged he used his office to benefit a Florida eye doctor in exchange for nearly $1 million in gifts and campaign contributions
 Menendez repeatedly defended himself and said he did nothing wrong
 He faced 14 criminal counts, including eight counts of bribery
Menendez was later cleared of the criminal charges three years later after the Justice Department asked a federal court to dismiss the 2015 indictment
While calls for him to resign have grown, Menendez has remained defiant, denying the indictment’s allegations and saying in a statement last week he is “not going anywhere
”Almost all of New Jersey’s Democratic House delegation has publicly called on Menendez to step down, including Donald Norcross, Josh Gottheimer, Frank Pallone, Bill Pascrell and Mikie Sherrill, along with Gov
 Phil Murphy
Rep
 Andy Kim, D-N

WASHINGTON − Former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter made a surprise trip to the Plains Peanut Festival in Plains, Georgia, on Saturday despite their health challenges
The Carters, both born in Plains, rode in a black SUV through the festival while attendees took photos and waved at them, as seen in a video shot by a spectator
“Beautiful day for President & Mrs
 Carter to enjoy a ride through the Plains Peanut Festival! And just a week before he turns 99,” the Carter Center wrote on X, formerly Twitter
 “We’re betting peanut butter ice cream is on the menu for lunch! #JimmyCarter99”Jimmy Carter entered hospice care at age 98 in February after a series of short hospital stays, and his grandson, Jason Carter, told USA TODAY this month that his grandparents were nearing an end
Rosalynn Carter, 96, was diagnosed with dementia in March
“He's been in hospice now for several months, but they are happy,” Jason Carter, chairman of the Carter Center’s Board of Trustees and an attorney, told USA TODAY
 “They are together
 They are at home
 They're in love, and I don't think anyone gets more than that
 I mean, it's a perfect situation for this time in their lives
”He also told USA TODAY that “their ability to stay grounded in who they are, despite all of the things that they've done in their life, is remarkable
”Ahead of the former president’s birthday on Oct
 1, the Carter Center is calling on the public to upload birthday wishes with a photo or video to be featured in a digital mosaic of Jimmy Carter
 Contributing: Marina PitofskyA top Russian official warned that Ukraine must surrender on Moscow's terms or the country will "cease to exist," and Ukraine claimed to have killed a top Russian admiral in Crimea as the war dragged into its 20th month with no solution in sight
Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, told Russian state media that President Joe Biden, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and other Western officials have poured massive amounts of time, effort, money and military might into the war
 Nineteen months after Russia's invasion began, the West has made little headway while its economies struggle and support dwindles, Volodin said
"The simple facts are these: The West is experiencing weapons and ammunition shortages, people in Europe and the U
S
 have lost trust in politicians, and the Kyiv regime’s counteroffensive has failed," Volodin said
Ukraine and Western officials claim steady progress in the counteroffensive, and Biden has been all-in behind Ukraine
 But some Republicans in Congress have waffled on spending plans for the war, and an ABC News/Washington Post survey released Sunday revealed a softening in public support
 More than 40% of respondents said the U
S
 is doing too much, up from 33% in February, and half said the U
S
 is doing the right amount or not enough, down from 60%
Developments:∎ Polish President Andrzej Duda downplayed a grain squabble with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and walked back an announcement that Poland would no longer send weapons to Kyiv
 Duda told the Warsaw tabloid Super Express that Poland would send its older equipment to Ukraine as it is replaced with modern weapons
∎ The first of 31 high-tech M1 Abrams tanks promised by the U
S
 have arrived in Ukraine, Zelenskyy said on Telegram
 "Abrams are already in Ukraine and are preparing to reinforce our brigades
 I am grateful to the allies for fulfilling the agreements!" Zelenskyy wrote
Admiral Viktor Sokolov, commander of Russia's Black Sea Feet, was killed in a Ukrainian attack on Russian naval headquarters in Crimea, Ukraine's  Special Operations Forces claimed in a Telegram post
 The post said 34 "officers" were killed and more than 100 Russian troops were wounded in the attack Friday
 Russian officials have not commented on casualties from the assault, which Ukraine said destroyed the building
Ukraine has been targeting Crimean military installations as part of a concerted effort to take back the peninsula seized by Russia almost a decade ago
"This is a remarkable achievement by Ukraine eliminating a very significant Russian military leader and many of his subordinates," retired U
S
 Adm
 James Stavridis said in a post on X, formerly Twitter
 "I believe you have to go back to WWII to find other admiral killed in combat
"A kindergarten, three apartment buildings and several single-family homes were damaged or destroyed by Russian artillery in Chasiv Yar, a town of about 13,000 people in the hotly contested Donetsk region, the regional administration said Monday on Telegram
 A casualty count was not immediately available
 The town is near war-battered Bakhmut, and locals had long been urged to leave
 Agence France-Presse journalist Arman Soldin was killed in a rocket attack on the edge of Chasiv Yar in May
"Chasiv Yar is now one of the most dangerous places for life in Donetsk region
 All civilians must evacuate − it's a matter of survival!" the post said
Many in the West bemoan the slow progress of Ukraine's counteroffensive, but Ukrainian forces actually have "done what successful militaries do − they have adapted and are now advancing," says Nataliya Bugayova, a Russia Fellow at the Institute for the Study of War
 Bugayova says Ukraine recognized the depth of Russia's defenses much faster than the Western policymakers who anticipated a swift Ukrainian breakthrough
But Ukraine’s ingenuity is yielding results, Bugayova writes for the institute
 Russian forces have failed to stop the advance in two directions, and Ukraine maintains the battlefield initiative, she says
 And the Ukrainian military continues to liberate its territory and people while slowly but steadily cracking "an incredibly formidable" defense
"Now is not the time for Western doubt," she says
 "The West must reinforce its military and diplomatic commitments and lean in to help sustain Ukraine’s battlefield momentum
"Britain's military has sent Royal Engineers to Poland to train Ukrainians in high-tech bomb removal techniques, the British Defense Ministry says
 Britain has sent 1,500 mine detectors to Ukraine, and more are on the way
 The Russians have heavily mined broad fields along the front lines, presenting a major challenge to the Ukrainian military's counteroffensive
 The "tailored training package" educates Ukraine's mine disposal teams in munition recognition, disposal methods and search procedures to overcome improvised explosive devices (IEDs), mines, booby traps and trip wires, the Defense Ministry said
 Defense Secretary Grant Shapps affirmed "unwavering support" for Ukraine
"Putin’s illegal invasion has left Ukraine’s fields and towns covered in deadly land mines and unexploded munitions, which presents an immediate danger to its citizens now and for years to come," Shapps said
Celebrations erupted in the NASA control room as the capsule containing samples from the asteroid Bennu touched down in the Utah desert Sunday after a 4 billion mile journey that lasted seven years
The capsule containing pieces from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu separated from the spacecraft known as the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer, or the OSIRIS-REx, and entered Earth's atmosphere
 The mission was the first U
S
 attempt to retrieve and analyze samples from an asteroid
OSIRIS-REx's van-sized craft visited Bennu, scraped and collected material from the asteroid’s surface, and sealed it into a 3-foot-wide container, equipped with a heat shield, called the Sample Return Capsule for delivery to Earth
The capsule parachuted into the Utah Test and Training Range in Utah's West Desert, about 80 miles west of Salt Lake City, at approximately 11 a
m
 EDT
Scientists recovered the sample from the landing, and the sample will be sent to the Johnson Space Center in Houston
Explained:How NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft brought Bennu asteroid sample back to EarthWill Bennu hit Earth?NASA projection, size, what to knowOSIRUS-REx is an unmanned, solar-powered spacecraft about the size of a household toolshed
 Five science instruments mapped Bennu's chemistry and mineralogy, to determine the effect of sunlight on the asteroid's orbit
The cost of the mission, excluding launch, is $800 million
A timeline of significant events:First discovered in 1999, Bennu is believed to be part of a larger asteroid that collided with another space rock
 It’s about one-third of a mile wide and is roughly the height of the Empire State Building, according to NASA
Its black surface is packed with boulders, and it orbits the sun every 14 months
Bennu is rich in carbon and is believed to be a leftover fragment from the birth of the solar system, 4
5 billion years ago, a time capsule of sorts that may help understand and trace the origin of life
The asteroid was named after an Egyptian deity in 2013 by a nine-year-old boy from North Carolina
 Bennu is the ancient Egyptian deity linked with the Sun, creation and rebirth
Bennu is being studied to better understand other asteroids and their movements through space
 Information gathered by OSIRIS-REx may help in development of future technologies to deflect asteroids that threaten to collide with Earth

Gender-bending provocateur Lil Nas X struck gold with his Top 10 pop hit “Star Walkin’” this spring when the song sold a half-million copies, marking his 10th single certified by the Recording Industry Association of America at the time
 Viral emcee Saucy Santana, who received a cosign from gay icon Madonna when they teamed up for a Pride Month performance, got a nod for a MTV Video Music Award for a performance of his Billboard Rap Airplay hit “Booty
” And rap princess Ice Spice is melting down heteronormativity with her red-hot success
 The rapper gave a breezy shoutout to her queer sexuality on the song “Bikini Bottom,” taken from her Top 5 rap EP “Like

?”  While these rappers have ushered in an “unprecedented visibility of LGBTQ hip-hop” with their queer-friendly lyrics and aesthetics, they join a storied lineage of queer pioneers – including Age of Consent, Medusa and Deep D--kollective – who have been pushing the envelope in hip-hop since its inception 50 years ago
“It’s an exciting moment,” says Lauron Kehrer, assistant professor of ethnomusicology at Western Michigan University
 “We’re finally having this mainstream representation of what many of us have always known, which is that there’s always been queer hip-hop
”Da Brat, who became a hip-hop heavyweight with the release of 1994’s “Funkdafied,” welcomed her first child with wife Jesseca Harris-Dupart in July
 In a 2020 interview with Variety, the rapper reflected on how industry expectations and public reception informed her decision to remain closeted at the start of her musical career
“I was always told you want to be (desirable) to men and women to sell records — you don’t want anybody to discriminate,’ Da Brat told the outlet
 “It was absolutely my decision
 I mean, you saw what happened to people like Ellen (DeGeneres): Remember when she lost her TV show, and all these horrible things were happening? People were totally against it
”H
 Samy Alim, professor of anthropology and faculty director of the Hip Hop Initiative at the University of California, Los Angeles, says financial concerns within the music industry discouraged the mainstream inclusion of LGBTQ hip-hop artists in the past
“If the industry believes that queer artists cannot sell, which it did for decades, then they won’t promote it and won’t support it,” Alim says
 “That never meant that there weren’t queer hip-hop artists doing the work because there always was, but the industry itself is dollars and cents
”Kehrer says this commercialization of hip-hop led to a predominant image of rappers as being straight Black men, which ultimately limited representation in the genre
 “When we have this narrow approach to what we expect a rapper to look or sound like, that makes it challenging for anyone outside of that norm,” they say
Bisexual rapper Doechii, who attracted a queer following with her 2020 song “Yucky Blucky Fruitcake,” opened up in an October 2022 interview with GQ about how having a community of LGBTQ peers in her personal life helped her embrace her queer identity
“I always knew that I was queer and I was bisexual, but I didn't really feel comfortable talking about it because nobody around me was gay,” Doechii told the outlet
 “I just started indulging myself with more friends who were like me, and that's when I could become more comfortable talking about it because that's my normal everyday conversation now with my gay friends
”Kehrer says it’s this combination of openness and sense of community – both in real life and online – among today’s youth that’s helped create a space for queer hip-hop artists
 “We’re looking at a generation now that is much more comfortable with ideas of gender and sexual fluidity,” they say
The ability to organically create community provided by social media platforms has had a “huge influence” on the rise of queer representation in media, including hip-hop, says Eve Ng, associate professor at Ohio University’s School of Media Arts and Studies
“In the past, if you were a musician, you basically needed a (record) label to sign you in order to get the product out there and be able to circulate your music
 But, of course, now with social media, you don’t need any of that,” Ng says
 “If you’re a queer performer, you could use those platforms to build your audience
”Alim says queer emcees’ efforts to create community and self-advocate in their work, going as far back as the homo-hop movement (a collective of openly LGBTQ hip-hop artists in the 1990s), has allowed them to fight “for greater voice, for greater impact
”During a November 2021 interview with GQ, Lil Nas X said he foresaw a bright future for LGBTQ representation in the hip-hop landscape
“Change is happening
 There’s going to be so many gay rappers
 There’s going to be more trans people in the industry and whatnot,” the rapper told the outlet
 “Ten years from now, everything that I’m doing won’t even seem like it was shocking
”Although this recent wave of queer hip-hop artists signifies progress within the genre, Ng says queerphobia still poses a threat to the success of LGBTQ emcees, especially those lacking industry status
“It’s misleading to think just because there’s Lil Nas X that there’s no more homophobia,” Ng says
 “You can’t just point to one or even five or 100 successful people in a marginalized group and say that those issues aren’t there anymore
”Alim says LGBTQ artists in hip-hop will use the revolutionary “spirit of hip-hop culture” to challenge anti-queer stigma and expand the genre’s diversity
“Hip-hop culture comes from communities that were meant to be decimated, not just marginalized: communities that were destroyed, abandoned, intentionally robbed of resources,” Alim says
 “If hip-hop culture in the ‘70s, ‘80s and ’90s was decentering white supremacy, recent hip-hop culture and hip-hop of the future is decentering sexism (and) heteronormativity, along with white supremacy (and) capitalism

C's 'Walk This Way' brought hip-hop to the masses and made Aerosmith cool againFrom streetwear to 'street couture':Hip-hop transformed fashion like no other before itIn February 2019, Sen
 Bob Menendez was having nightmares
 The Democratic senator from New Jersey said he was haunted by a question that "keeps me up at night" − whether President Donald Trump was compromised by the Russian government because of past secret dealings
Menendez's restless nights also may have had something to do with the fact that at the time, he was allegedly accepting lavish gifts from various sources in exchange for using his Senate seat to bestow favors
The indictment of Menendez and his wife last week included details of alleged bribes that went to the senator in exchange for revealing sensitive, nonpublic information to Egyptian contacts less than a year before his sleep-deprived speech
Menendez denied the accusations on Friday
 However, even if half of this indictment is true, Menendez is toast
 He was able to dodge a bullet in 2017 when a jury hung over a separate series of corruption charges involving lavish gifts
 This time, the Justice Department says it has photos of thousands of dollars in cash stuffed in clothing, a luxury car, gold bars and other gifts
 That would keep anyone up at night, but there may be one other insomniac this week: Hunter Biden's lawyer Abbe Lowell
The Menendez indictment likely proved chilling reading for Lowell, who not only represents President Joe Biden's son but also represented Menendez in his prior bribery trial
There are striking similarities between the Menendez and Biden cases
While Hunter Biden was allegedly selling access to and influence with his father, he also allegedly received massive payments
 His associate Devon Archer told Congress that they were selling the Biden family "brand," and that Joe Biden was "the brand
"Don't tell me how to do my job:Biden scolds media on how to cover his impeachment inquiry
 What a bunch of bull jerky
Like Menendez, Hunter Biden allegedly received a luxury car from his foreign clients
 For the senator, the Justice Department says it was a $60,000 Mercedes-Benz
 For the president's son, investigators say it was a $142,000 Fisker sports car
Menendez allegedly received gold bars worth up to $120,000
 Biden received a diamond allegedly worth $80,000
Indeed, the alleged object of these payments was influence with then-Vice President Biden, when he was the presiding officer of the Senate
 Menendez was one of the nation's most powerful senators at the time
There are also dealings that reference Hunter Biden and his associates in the Menendez matter
 When the senator was trying to arrange for Joe Biden to host a foreign event, an aide to Menendez reportedly reached out to Hunter Biden's associates
While the president's son is accused of peddling influence, in Menendez's case, it is his wife who is accused of acting as a go-between with those trying to buy the senator's attention
 Nadine Menendez allegedly had lunches and countless communications with people, who, according to the indictment, sought favors from the senator
Nadine Menendez allegedly knew the co-defendants before she married the senator in 2020
 The couple met at an IHOP, but he fittingly proposed to her in 2019 at the Taj Mahal on a trip to India
 The setting for the proposal would foretell the lavish gifts to come
Like Hunter, Nadine started an international consulting company, Strategic International Business Consultants, after being unemployed before meeting the senator
 She found ample business
Like Hunter, she is accused of marketing her ability to deliver access to her husband
 In March 2020, she allegedly texted an Egyptian official that “anytime you need anything you have my number and we will make everything happen
”Left's incessant prosecution of Trump:In Democrats' quest to prosecute former president, progressives ignore free speech rightsThere is of course a major difference between the Biden and Menendez cases: Menendez and his wife are being criminally charged for their alleged influence peddling
The Justice Department has not only let the statute of limitations run out on the most serious tax charges against Hunter Biden, but it also has not charged the president's son under the Foreign Agents Registration Act
Despite charging figures like Paul Manafort for similar accusations, prosecutors have avoided charges in the Biden case that would put Hunter at the center of a corruption prosecution
 Instead, they sought an embarrassing "sweetheart deal" that collapsed in court
In the Menendez case, investigators left no stone unturned in tracing gifts and money
 In the Biden case, a special agent with the IRS testified before Congress that the Bidens were tipped off on planned searches and an attempt to interview the president's son
As the Justice Department grinds Menendez into a fine powder, it is likely to draw more attention to the relatively light touch shown Hunter Biden
 It is, as Menendez said on the Senate floor in 2019, the type of thing that keeps you up at night

"Travis Kelce, Taylor Swift dating?Jason Kelce jokes the love story is '100% true'WASHINGTON — Yes, the 2024 presidential election might be a repeat of 2020, with voters choosing between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump
 That doesn't mean Americans don't have other names in mind
A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll from June found that in a potential rematch between the two current frontrunners, 34% of voters said they would support Biden while 32% said they would support Trump
 Meanwhile, 23% of voters say they would support an unspecified independent contender
Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, told USA TODAY his national surveys indicate about 25% of registered voters across the country say they would vote for someone other than Biden or Trump, or wouldn't vote at all
 It's a trend that has stayed consistent since November 2021
But why are voters dissatisfied with both candidates? Who would voters rather see sworn in as the next president of the United States?Voters from across the political spectrum gave USA TODAY a list of Republican and Democratic officials they'd rather see serve as commander-in-chief
 The options range from progressive Democrats to moderate Republicans, but they're all current or former officials with experience leading
 Here's a closer look
One of the ideal Democratic candidates for some voters USA TODAY interviewed was Sen
 Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass
, who ran for president in 2020 with one of the most progressive agendas in the Democratic field
“She has the wisdom
 She has the policy expertise
 She has consumer expertise, and she has the historical knowledge that I think that she could actually take this country and take it to the next level that we need to go,” said Patricia Holliday, a 66-year-old from Florida who serves on the board for the Capital Medical Society
Holliday said Warren “completely understands” how policy on issues ranging from climate change to women's rights affects everyday citizens, and she could use that insider knowledge to create change
“She has the moral authority," Holliday said
 "She has the energy that is just driving force
"Shreya Dandu, a 21-year-old masters student at George Mason University in Virginia, said she likes that Warren represents a “more progressive wing of the party
”“I really liked her health care plan
 And I think she has a lot of good things to say, and I really like what she did with her past work and…how she would warn people about the 2008 financial crisis, and I feel like she's… on the side of the people,” Dandu said
Dandu added that another ideal presidential candidate for her would be Rep
 Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N
Y
, the youngest woman to serve in Congress who also has a progressive outlook on health care, income inequality and climate change policy
“Speaking as another woman of color, I just love to see someone like her just go into politics, especially because young women of color are very underrepresented…and I really like how she's not afraid to like speak her voice, which I think is really important for a politician, and she's a good role model for younger woman,” Dandu said
But voters haven't completely turned their back on Biden heading into 2024
“He has done more in these four years than I thought was possible, especially given the intense Republican and often unfair Republican opposition to even bipartisan supported bills,” said Spencer Dirrig, a 26-year-old who lives in Ohio and serves as the vice president for the Midwest of the Young Democrats of America
Dirrig said Biden has set his sights on issues that young people care about, including climate change, student debt, and support for unions
 He argued that Biden’s character also sets him apart from other candidates
“Biden isn't just a president who is able to deliver on policy, but he's a president we can look up to," Dirring said
"Frankly, when it comes to all the political drama that we see in the news, when it comes to the former president's social media tweets and attacks on individuals, Joe Biden doesn't mess around with all of that
 He's focused on the job at hand, which is delivering for the American people,” Dirrig said
He also said he thinks concerns about Biden’s age are being blown out of proportion, calling Biden, 80, "the only person who's going to be able to deliver meaningful bipartisan policy wins for young people like me
"The 2024 Republican primary has drawn a long list of candidates
 But that doesn't mean voters aren't hoping a few more potential presidents toss their hat in the ring
Earlier this month, the organization Free Speech for People filed a lawsuit to bar Trump from appearing on Minnesota's ballot in 2024
 One voter involved in the effort, David Thul, said his ideal candidate would be former Texas Rep
 Will Hurd, a vocal critic of Trump who is running in the 2024 race
“Hurd has been outspoken on the deficit issue in the long term federal debt in terms of the need to reduce spending," Thul, a 51-year-old logistics manager, said, also applauding Hurd for his time spent as an undercover CIA officer and his calls to support Ukraine and counter China
"Those are the kind of hot button issues that motivate me in politics,” he added
Tammy Hester, a 52-year-old who lives in Washington, D
C
, said that although she’s a Democrat, her ideal candidate would be former Wyoming Rep
 Liz Cheney
 The former lawmaker has also been outspoken about Trump, and she lost her re-election bid in the 2022 midterms
“I don't agree with her policy but again, I don't necessarily vote on policy because to me that's going to change with every election cycle,” Hester, who works for a federal contracting business, said
 “For me, it's about someone having a moral fiber
""She just has appeared to me to be a person that will at least come to the table and engage in conversations with other parties," Hester said
For 66-year-old Walter Cox, a private chauffeur who lives in California, his ideal candidate would be Utah Sen
 Mitt Romney, who recently announced he would not run for re-election in 2024
 Cox called Romney's legislation in the Senate "a true win-win" for both sides
"That's just who the guy is
 He's open to things
 He's not like ‘it's my way or the highway,’ you know? So I just love that about the guy,” Cox said
Cox said that he believes Romney would be a candidate to bridge the polarizing divide in the country, calling the Utah lawmaker a principled person willing to take “slings and arrows
”“When everyone was against him, he was saying about the Trump impeachment
 He was like, Look, there's enough there that we should look at it
 That's our job as a nation," Cox said
But Trump still appeals to 62-year-old car dealer Francis Wihbey, based in Connecticut, and 70-year-old Daniel Murphy, a retired voter living in Arizona
“I think Trump is a guy that shoots straight,” Murphy said
 “I think he - more than most presidents - has done what he said he was going to do
 And I don't think he has much of a hidden agenda
 And I think he is beyond a doubt here to help the country, not himself, unlike others in government right now
”Not all voters dissatisfied with a choice between Trump and Biden have another option in mind
Paul Beck, professor of political science at The Ohio State University, explained to USA TODAY there is never going to be an ideal candidate for most voters, noting that they "basically settle on who is better than the others," and that may include a mix of positive and negative characteristics
Quentin Wathum-Ocama, the 32-year-old president of the Young Democrats of America and an elementary school educator, told USA TODAY that “I think a lot of voters and I think a lot of my cohort - millennials and Gen Z - they're really just looking for someone who's gonna talk about their issues
"He said he would want somebody who recognizes climate change and is willing to stand up for worker’s rights
“We want people - when they have that working majority in the government - to take on those big and bold ideas,” Wathum-Ocama said
 “I think that's what I'm looking for
”Caiden Anderson, a 19-year-old who serves on the board of the Texas Young Republicans, also told USA TODAY he doesn't have an ideal candidate in mind
 But he wants someone who is young, energetic and shares his values
 Candidates who best represent that description include Florida Gov
 Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Virginia Gov
 Glenn Youngkin and others, he said
“With DeSantis, his record sort of speaks for itself in Florida," Anderson said
 "He's got a lot of things he's done there with the economy and with COVID policy
”He also pointed to DeSantis’ efforts in passing laws on what can be taught in classrooms and extending parental oversight of children’s education
Annika Krovi, a 16-year-old national chairwoman of the High School Democrats of America, told USA TODAY that her ideal candidate would be one that makes an active effort to work with younger voters to address issues such as gun violence prevention, climate and environmental justice and increased higher education accessibility
 “As a young brown woman, I'm also looking forward to supporting a candidate that is willing to protect reproductive rights and fight for racial equality,” Krovi said
The problem isn't necessarily Biden and Trump themselves, Samara Klar, a professor at the school of government and public policy at the University of Arizona, told USA TODAY
 Researchers have been spotting a trend of voters saying they dislike prominent candidates for the past two electoral cycles
“We’re also seeing a rising percentage of Americans upwards of 25% say that they don't like either party generally…it’s not only these candidates that seem to be turning off voters, although they are, but it's also just the political parties in general,” Klar said
And it's common incumbent presidents to be less popular in the year before a reelection bid, Franklin said
 “Most, but not all, see some rise in their job approval during the reelection campaign year,” Franklin said
 “Part of that is simply that governing usually includes disappointments while campaigning allows the incumbent to stress their virtues and successes, reminding voters why they won last time
”For Biden, one of voters’ biggest concerns appears to center around age
 Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, previously argued that, even if Biden's age has not affected his ability to do the job, "some members of the public may nonetheless believe he is not mentally sharp enough or that he lacks the necessary physical stamina
”Voters also have concerns around Biden's handling of inflation, which could worsen if the United Auto Workers' strike is lengthy, and a looming government shutdown that could affect interest rates, according to Michael Traugott, a political scientist at the University of Michigan
For Trump, one of his liabilities is his indictments in four criminal cases, according to David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center
 A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll from June found that 33% of sampled Republican and Independent voters said they would be less likely to vote for Trump due to his legal troubles
A while back, Katrina Mosler set up a barrier around the trash cans outside her rural northern California home
 Bears had been invading the bins and tearing through bungee cords meant to keep them shut
 But at about 3 a
m
 on a Tuesday in August, she heard a commotion
 The motion detector lights outside lit up
 A persistent bear wanted to get at the trash despite the enclosure
 Wide awake, Mosler decided to check something before returning to bed
 She logged on to her student loan servicer website
What she saw was a smiley face and a balance of zero
 Mosler, 47, is one of about 804,000 people who found themselves in the same enviable situation this summer
 Her outstanding student loan balance, which she had been paying down for roughly 20 years, was gone
 This group of borrowers signed up for what, decades ago, was a new option from the federal government: Making regular payments aligned to their income for 20 or 25 years
 When they hit that threshold, the rest of their balance was supposed to be forgiven
 A review, however, found that for some of them, years of payments hadn’t added up to an erased balance
 The federal Education Department is correcting a miscalculation in the number of payments a legion of borrowers made
 Mosler, of an area called McKinleyville, California, said the $27,000 she owed hung over her life
 Now, as one of the 804,000 whose debts have been erased, there’s room to think about saving for a down payment on a house, instead of the rental surrounded by redwoods, and bears, where she lives with her husband
 Others with student loan debt whose balances were cleared report paying what they originally borrowed, or twice that, and still staring down thousands of dollars to repay
 Mosler started college in 1995 at what was then Humboldt State University, taking out student loans to finance a physical therapy degree
 But she dropped out two years later and put her loans into forbearance, meaning she didn't make payments but interest accrued
 The size of what she thought was a manageable amount of debt ballooned
 “When you drop out, there’s no guidance,” she said
 “I was 20 and struggling and just pretty aimless
” Student loan interest crisis?New bill could eliminate rates for many borrowersMosler returned to school a decade after her first go, only to graduate with a degree she realized wouldn’t lead to her dream career as a physical therapist
 And while the income-based repayment option allowed her to stay afloat as she worked a low-wage retail job, the interest – combined with confusion over whether her payments counted – made it feel like a balance of zero was moving further and further out of reach
 Even when she eventually found success in massage therapy, the debt continued to haunt her
 That relief happened overnight feels surreal for Mosler and many others who got that smiley face
 These “golden emails,” as student loan expert and advocate Betsy Mayotte describes them, came after decades of sacrifices made to keep up with the payments
 Borrowers including Mosler shared some of their tales of forgiveness on Reddit, on what Mayotte labeled the "Mega-thread for the golden emails
"Their experiences leading up to the erasure of their balances, and the basic expenses they can now afford as a result, show the extent to which the student loan system has affected hundreds of thousands of older low- and middle-income borrowers
 Amid debate over who should pay and be accountable for the country’s spiraling student loan crisis are borrowers who lived up to what they signed up for and did as told but still haven't shed their debt
 “They’re promising that you’re going to have it retired in 20 or 25 years,” said Christopher Gaunya, who, at 61, thought he would never be able to buy a home or save enough to retire comfortably
Then a few weeks ago, Gaunya eagerly refreshed his inbox and there it was – an email notifying him, essentially, that he was off the hook
 Off the hook for the nearly $150,000 he owed on $63,000 student loans dating back to the 1980s, an amount that snowballed thanks to interest locked in at more than 8%
 Off the hook for debt that at one point had Gaunya contemplating suicide
“It feels like I can breathe again,” said the acupuncturist, who is based in Massachusetts
 He is one of more than a million people who signed onto a Change
org petition calling on the president to cancel loans and restore borrowers’ bankruptcy rights
 Gaunya completed much of his higher education, including a bachelor's in geography, without borrowing a lot to finance it
 A job working for the state helped him keep up with the payments
 But in the mid-1990s, he decided to switch careers and study acupuncture
 That meant tens of thousands in additional student loans, all for training that he said ultimately failed to teach him what he needed to know to make a living in the field
Gaunya persevered, getting an acupuncture contract job at a hospital and eventually a full-time gig with the Department of Veterans Affairs
 Signing up for income-driven repayment – years after completing acupuncture school and only after he did lots of his own research – allowed him to get his payments under control
  Under income-driven repayment, however, many borrowers’ monthly bills are so low they don’t touch or barely graze the principal
 Their debts can mushroom
That was the case for Mosler, whose loan payments never seemed to reduce her debt
 “You look at your bill
 Your payment is for $113, and $8 of that goes to the principal
 The rest goes to interest
 It just feels really defeating
” The Biden administration had for more than a year been working on an adjustment to recalculate the number of payments some borrowers made, which Education Secretary Miguel Cardona framed as a fix to “past administrative failures
” The outstanding debt of affected borrowers was what remained on their loans after the equivalent of 20 to 25 years’ worth of payments
“For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress toward forgiveness,” Cardona said in a July statement announcing the news
  The 804,000 borrowers whose loans were discharged through the adjustment mark one of the largest groups of former students who’ve seen relief under the Biden administration this year
 Another 1
1 million borrowers have had their debt forgiven through defense to repayment, in which students who were defrauded by their colleges are eligible for relief
 An additional 175,000 borrowers who worked for more than a decade in public service finally got the relief they were promised back when they chose to go into these modestly paying careers
 When he got the first email notifying him of his prospective relief, Gaunya nearly cried
 “I got shaky and welled up and was like, ‘Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
’” Vibrating with excitement, he forced himself to “not act like this is real
” He wanted to wait until he got the official email, until “everything says zero, zero, zero
”Like pretty much all of Biden’s efforts to relieve student debt, this one-time adjustment was almost immediately met with a lawsuit
 A couple weeks after the adjustment’s announcement, two right-leaning think tanks – the Cato Institute and Mackinac Center for Public Policy – sued the administration, arguing it lacked the authority to forgive the outstanding debt
 But a federal judge quickly dismissed the lawsuit
 Now that it’s reality, Gaunya is allowing himself to celebrate
 Even if more lawsuits challenge the adjustment, he’s convinced any relief already doled out will be impossible to recuperate
 The pause is over
As student loan payments resume, how to make sure you're preparedStudent loan debt forgiveness, once an idea limited to progressive circles, moved into the mainstream
 Biden, once seen as a centrist Democrat, made it a campaign promise
 Some members of Congress, particularly those on the right, have argued student debt relief is a Band-Aid and that pressure instead ought to be on colleges for reducing tuition costs
 Many Americans believe relief for borrowers is a handout at the expense of taxpayer dollars
 “It makes me mad when people are like, ‘I’m a taxpayer
 I don’t see why I have to pay for your mistakes,'” said Lisa Frisby, 52
 “I’m telling you, I’ve been paying on that student loan
”When Frisby started college in 1993, she was on her own to finance a degree
 She borrowed money to pay for housing, tuition and books, and got a job so she would have health insurance
 A pair of degrees in computer science and management information sciences from her New Jersey university, at first, seemed to pay off
 The salary from her first job was enough to cover her rent and make student loan payments
 But 25 years after graduation, the debt wasn’t gone – even though Frisby signed up for an income-driven repayment option and paid consistently for all that time
Somewhere along the way, she said, a record of some of her payments was lost
 There was no proof of nearly a decade’s worth of them
 Fast forward to this year: After about $70,000 worth of payments on a $40,000 loan, the golden email means she’s now finally free
 “I can’t tell you how relieved I am,” said Frisby, who bought the first new car she’s ever owned since her balance was erased
 Frisby returned to school to become a nurse, avoiding additional loans by getting help from family to pay tuition and shopping for the cheapest program she could find
 She’s actually due a refund because of all the payments she made, and if that money materializes, she said she will pay off all her credit card debt
 “I’ll just have my car and my mortgage,” she said
 “I don't need to be rich
 I just want to be at zero
"Emmy Yoder, 62, and her husband spent their careers in public service, he in social work, and she in public school teaching
 But they never managed to qualify for public service loan forgiveness (PSLF), apparently the result of bureaucratic lapses
 Her husband, who has an autoimmune disease, ended up having his student loan debt forgiven because of his illness
 Yoder, unable to secure PSLF, had to sign up for income-driven repayment
 Yet relief always felt fleeting, especially with the $40,000 in interest that accrued since she took out her loan in 1997 – not to mention the costs of raising their twins, now 29
Yoder made payments for more than two decades, though at times had to go into forbearance
 “Life isn’t cheap,” said Yoder, who before retiring last year worked at a high-poverty school in Missouri
 “Trying to balance it all was so difficult
”“It was a little embarrassing to admit that I wasn’t able to pay them off, but it wasn’t for lack of trying,” she said, noting she was told twice that she couldn’t get PSLF because her school district wasn’t low-income enough
 (PSLF does not have such rules
)  “I never did understand how I didn’t qualify for that
 It’s such an impossible situation, trying to understand
”A little over a month ago, she got the initial email explaining she might be eligible for relief through the one-time adjustment
 “I’ve never played the lottery; I’ve never won anything in my life,” said Yoder, one of the other signatories on the Change
org petition
 “This was amazing
” While they’re already retired, now Yoder and her husband finally have “a lot of breathing room
” One of her daughters, also a teacher, asked if Yoder can help with child care and now, Yoder feels comfortable saying yes
 She doesn’t have to get a part-time job to keep up with her student loan payments

orgThe Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce pairing has everyone in the NFL talking about them, including noted pop culture aficianado and Taylor Swift fan Bill Belichick
Swift was spotted in a luxury box at Sunday's Chiefs-Bears game, cheering on Kelce as he caught seven passes for 69 yards and a touchdown in a blowout win
 They were later seen leaving the game together
The New England Patriots coach, in his Monday morning appearance on Boston radio station WEEI, was asked about the power couple 


 and he delivered a classic response
"Well, I would say that Travis Kelce has had a lot of big catches in his career
 This would be the biggest," Belichick deadpanned
Belichick attended one of Swift's concerts over the summer, and applauded her commitment to performing in a heavy rainstorm at Gillette Stadium

"That was pretty impressive," Belichick said in an August appearance on WEEI

"Kerry Washington is baring it all
Ahead of the Tuesday release of her new memoir "Thicker Than Water," the "Scandal" actress sat down with "Good Morning America" co-anchor Robin Roberts for a one-hour "20/20" special on Sunday
"I've never wanted to share my private life for the sake of fame or for the sake of attention, but I feel like this sharing is with purpose," Washington told Roberts in a clip of the interview, published Sept
 21
In "Thicker Than Water," the 46-year-old gives readers an intimate view into both her public and private worlds, including chronicling her struggles with disordered eating, suicidal thoughts, learning that her dad isn't her biological father, having an abortion and childhood trauma
In an interview published Sunday with People magazine, Washington opened up about a revelation regarding her parents and her identity
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling BooklistShe shares in her memoir, per People, that she recently learned that her father, Earl Washington, is not her biological father
 "It really turned my world upside down," Washington told the outlet
She found out the truth when she told her parents she was going to appear on Henry Louis Gates Jr
's "Finding Your Roots" on PBS, a series where celebrities learn about their ancestry through DNA testing
"When I got this information, I was like, 'Oh
 I now know my story,'" Washington said
 "I didn't know what my story was, but I was playing the supporting character in their story
""By the time I got to college, my relationship with food and my body had become a toxic cycle of self-abuse that utilized the tools of starvation, binge eating, body obsession and compulsive exercise," Washington writes in her memoir, per "Good Morning America
"Washington detailed to Roberts the moment she knew things had gone too far
"The first time that I actually got on my knees and prayed to some power greater than myself to say like, 'I can't do this
 I need some help,' was with my eating disorder," Washington said, noting that with partying and substance use she she knew "how to manage" and was "so high functioning
"Her relationship with food, however, was another beast
"The body dysmorphia, the body hatred, it was beyond my control," she said
 "I could feel how the abuse was a way to really hurt myself as if I didn't want to be here
 It scared me that I could want to not be here because I was in so much pain
"Roberts then asked Washington if it got to the point of her contemplating suicide, to which Washington answered "Yeah
"Washington told People she "struggled a lot in the beginning with whether or not to include my abortion story
" The actress reveals in her book that she terminated her pregnancy in her 20s as her career was picking up
 She used a fake name at the time but was recognizable
She also opened up about her internal debate on whether to include it in her memoir during her sitdown with Roberts, sharing that she felt a bit of shame
"We stay in our circles of shame because we don't talk about it
 So, I challenged myself to try to write about my experience having an abortion to sort of let go of the shame about having an abortion and say, like, 'This is what — this happens
 A lot of women do this
 This is a form of health care
 This is OK,'" Washington told Roberts
More:Celebrity memoirs worth the hype from Viola Davis, Danny Trejo, Jennette McCurdy and moreWashington dove into many aspects of her life in her memoir, including an incident in which she says a boy inappropriately touched her while she was asleep during a childhood sleepover
 She was not initially aware of the violation but when she discovered what occurred, Washington says she chose not to report it
The Emmy-nominated talent told Roberts that "the hardest writing days" were spent recounting the incident, but she wanted to "remind myself and each other that we're not alone
""That little girl made the choice to not tell anyone
 I have a great deal of compassion for where the choice came from, and even a little admiration for that little girl, but I also adore her and feel so sad that she carried the burden of that on her own for so long," she said

Parents spend a lot of time worrying about how they’ll afford college tuition for their kids someday, but a pair of recent surveys show exorbitant college-like costs actually come much earlier in life
 In more than half the states, childcare costs more than in-state public college tuition, according to lending platform NetCredit
com
 Then, comes the price you pay for independent kids
 Teen car ownership now also costs more than in-state tuition at a public university, an analysis by car app Jerry shows
 Everyone already knows raising a child is expensive, but it’s getting even pricier
 After two years of elevated inflation, families are feeling pinched more than ever
 Overall, for example, parents spend a significant portion of their annual income on child-related expenses
 Nationwide, families spend 19% of their annual income on child-rearing expenses, online lending marketplace LendingTree said
 “Ideally, you’d be able to keep childcare costs to 10% or less of your total income,” said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst
 “But that’s laughably unrealistic for millions of Americans
” On average, childcare costs $1,031 a year more than public college tuition, NetCredit said
 Lower your auto insurance costs: Find the best car insurance of 2023NetCredit examined the average annual fees paid for public in-state college tuition and the average cost of childcare in each state and calculated the difference between the two
 Then, it compared these costs to local average salaries to find the affordability of childcare and in-state college tuition in every state
 In 28 out of 50 states, childcare tops in-state tuition, it said
 Hawaii has the largest gap: Annual childcare costs a whopping $15,995 more than a year of tuition
 New York is a close second with a $15, 951 gap between childcare and college costs
 At the other end of the spectrum, Vermont’s annual childcare costs were $5,423 less than in-state public college tuition, NetCredit said
 That’s followed by South Carolina, a distant second, with childcare $3,679 below annual tuition
  It costs $11,378 a year for a teen to own and drive a new car, more than the average annual in-state tuition at a four-year public university, estimated at $10,940, Jerry said
 To find this, Jerry used AAA’s driving costs calculator and added the difference ($829) in insurance costs between teen drivers and those over 19 years old
 It set annual mileage at 10,000, the choice closest to the 7,200 miles a year driven by the average teen, according to the U
S
 Federal Highway Administration
  When comparing increases in tuition and the costs of car ownership, it compared the College Board’s tuition in the 2017-18 academic year with the 2022-23 school year, and car ownership costs from the end of 2018 through July 2023
   Not every teen gets new wheels, of course, but even owning a used car can add up
 The annual $10,276 cost to own a 5-year-old Toyota Camry exceeds in-state tuition at the flagship public university in 13 states and is just $664 less than the average for all four-year public universities, Jerry said
 At $14
08 per hour - the average wage for fast food workers, lifeguards, retail salespeople, and amusement and recreation attendants - a teen would have to work 49 hours a week over a 15-week summer, or 14 hours every week for a year, to cover the cost of owning and driving a 2018 Toyota, assuming it’s financed, Jerry said
 “No wonder some studies have concluded that shifting economics explains much of the difference in attitudes toward driving and car ownership among Millennials and Gen Z,” wrote Jerry’s Henry Hoenig
 Demand for childcare has risen in the past couple of decades in line with the number of two-income households, according to the St
 Louis Federal Reserve
  In 2019, the public policy nonprofit Center for American Progress said about half of U
S
 children spend at least some time in a licensed childcare facility
 Pair that with the pandemic, which fueled sudden wage growth for childcare workers as centers worked to attract and retain workers much like other businesses
 As of October 2021, average hourly earnings for childcare workers had risen 10
4% to $16
44 from the prior year —on top of already above-average wage growth of 4
3% between September 2019 and September 2020, and much stronger than the 5
8% wage growth for other workers, it said
 In July, annual childcare costs were up 6% from a year earlier, around twice the pace of overall inflation of 3
2%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said
  Childcare woes hurt everyone:Childcare crisis: What costly daycare and fewer workers mean for US economy and taxpayersBlame soaring prices for auto insurance, maintenance and car repairs, vehicle prices and parts, and gasoline
 Since 2018, they’ve all risen at least three times faster than tuition at four-year state universities, Jerry said
 And don’t expect car ownership to get much cheaper any time soon
 “As interest rates continue to climb, this adds a layer of expense per month that consumers should consider when shopping for their next vehicle,” said Greg Brannon, AAA’s director of automotive research
  The Fed has projected it will raise its benchmark, short-term fed funds rate one more time this year by a quarter point to a range of 5
5% to 5

   Republican voters will have another opportunity to kick the tires on the 2024 presidential candidates who take the stage Wednesday for the second GOP primary debate
Fewer White House hopefuls will debate this week than those who assembled for their first discussion in August, but it remains unclear how many will be on stage at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California
Six candidates have qualified for the second debate ahead of the Sept
 25 deadline, and Trump has again declined to participate
 The former president instead plans to visit Michigan to speak with striking auto workers
Trump remains the unquestionable frontrunner in the primary and besides pummeling attacks aimed at Florida Gov
 Ron DeSantis, he has largely ignored other contenders for the Republican nomination
 Polling out of New Hampshire, for instance, shows Trump holding a 26-point lead over his nearest competitor
That leaves the question of what, if anything, the other contenders must do to chip away at Trump's massive lead and gain traction with the GOP base
Here's a look at what is at stake for each of the candidates who have qualified for Wednesday's debate
DeSantis risks losing his title as Trump's chief rival in the contest after months of attacks and scrutiny have taken a toll
The CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released last week showed DeSantis plummeting by 13 percentage points among likely voters in the Granite State since July
 The drop took Florida's governor from second at 23% to fifth with 10% support
DeSantis, who gained notoriety in the conservative universe for being Florida's chief cultural warrior, noticeably didn't take lay a finger on Trump during the first debate
But while campaigning in Iowa recently, DeSantis said anti-abortion activists "should know that (Trump's) preparing to sell you out" after the former president called Florida's six-week ban on abortion a "terrible mistake" politically
 He later told a TV news station Trump "believes he's entitled" to the GOP nomination and isn't "doing the work it takes to really earn people's votes
"DeSantis can't afford to lose more ground, so many expect he will be more aggressive on stage this week
If anyone received an adrenaline rush out of the Aug
 23 debate in Milwaukee, it was former South Carolina Gov
 Nikki Haley who saw a boost in the polls
Haley has been trying to strike a more traditional tone for a Republican nominee, emphasizing fiscal policies such as cutting middle-class taxes as a way to soothe ongoing economic woes
During a speech in New Hampshire, where she is currently polling third, Haley said her former boss was "thin-skinned and easily distracted
"Haley has also leaned into her foreign policy background as the former UN ambassador under Trump, saying he was strong at first on international affairs but has become "weak in the knees" in terms of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia
Where Haley is likely to distinguish herself the most on Wednesday is by emphasizing surveys showing that she is the best Republican to defeat President Joe Biden in a hypothetical general election
 She has also recently made Vice President Kamala Harris a foil in her interviews, saying that is her real opponent
Vivek Ramaswamy's campaign has been a quest to "out-Trump" Trump, which got him to the center of the debate stage in August
That also came with inheriting a brighter spotlight from opponents, who slammed him as inexperienced, and reporters, who have taken a closer look at his "revolutionary" ideas and life story
In the weeks since the first debate the 38-year-old biotech millionaire has stayed in the news for various reasons: flip-flopping on joining TikTok as a way to appeal to younger voters; comparing Rep
 Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass
, a Black woman, to the Ku Klux Klan; and defending his past use of a temporary visa program for high-skilled foreign workers, despite his calls to dismantle the system
 The question is if Ramaswamy will be a momentary flavor of voters seeking a Trump alternative while asking why they should chose a diet version of the former president
Perhaps picking up on that question, Ramaswamy said at a campaign event in Ohio last week how his "friend" Trump misled Republicans when he promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act
"Eight years later, did it happen? No, it did not," Ramaswamy said
 "It is a false promise if it is contingent on Congress
"Mike Pence has one of the most difficult tightropes to walk in the 2024 primary
 He is Trump's former vice president who says he is proud of their record while finding ways to finds contrasts with the man who put him on 2016 ticket
As of late that has been Pence, a former congressman and governor, has been calling out Trump's populist style, saying it hurts Republicans in the long-run and isn't compatible with conservatism
 He stressed how Trumpism—and by extension the MAGA movement—is more about "personal grievances and performative outrage" than traditional conservative principles at a recent speech in New Hampshire
"The truth is, Donald Trump, along with his imitators, often sound like an echo of the progressives they would replace," Pence said
The question coming into Wednesday is can Pence convince a significant portion of Republicans that being the traditional GOP standard bearer can effectively win a primary
Sen
 Tim Scott's nice guy approach resulted in him being largely forgotten during the first GOP debate in August, where he spoke for about eight minutes during the two-hour event
One area where he could find more room to breathe is the differences among Republicans on abortion access
 Scott is a staunch social conservative, and has said in recent interviews how Trump is "wrong" on abortion, and that the country needs a "pro-life president in the future
"Scott, much like Pence, will have to make a case for why supporting a 15-week national abortion ban is a political winner at a time when progressives are winning statewide referendums
The South Carolina lawmaker may also find time to carve out his position on striking auto workers after jousting with UAW President Shawn Fain, who filed an unfair labor practice claim against Scott for suggesting striking workers should be fired
"They want to threaten me and shut me up," Scott said
 "They don’t scare me
"Chris Christie remains the most outspoken Republican in terms of focusing almost exclusively on warning primary voters that Trump's four criminal trials will be a fatal flaw in 2024
The former New Jersey is also calling Trump a chicken for once again bypassing a debate
"If I was him, I wouldn't want to show up to the debate either," Christie said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, citing the Trump administration's failure to build a wall at the U
S
-Mexico border, balance the budget or repeal the Affordable Care Act
But Christie faces a popularity issue himself that he will have to overcome, as polling shows just 17% of New Hampshire Republicans have a favorable view of him, according to the CNN/University of New Hampshire poll
 Even worse is that 60% of likely GOP primary voters in the survey said they wouldn't support Christie under any circumstance
LOS ANGELES – Reba McEntire is ready to take over Blake Shelton’s swivel chair on “The Voice
”The Grammy-winning country legend, 68, joins returning coaches Gwen Stefani, John Legend and Niall Horan on Season 24 of NBC's “The Voice” (returning Monday, 8 EDT/PDT) following Shelton’s departure after 23 seasons and nine wins
“Everybody's getting along great
 This bunch: So much fun,” McEntire says in an exclusive interview during a recent set visit
 “I get to hang out with Gwen without Blake around, so that’s fun
”McEntire is already part of “The Voice” family
 She was a battle adviser for Shelton’s team in Season 1, returned in Season 8 as a mentor and served as a "Mega Mentor" ahead of last season's Knockouts round
It was when McEntire was a Mega Mentor that she knew she wanted to have a bigger role in the singing competition series
 “You’ve got to do it,” Shelton told her, she recalls
“He was cheering me on, and we're both from Oklahoma, so you got that camaraderie going,” she says
Despite her prior mentoring experience, becoming a coach has come with a learning curve
 “It's a well-oiled machine and they've been very patient with me, which I'm very grateful for,” she says
Best shows to watch this fall:What's new on TV amid dual writers' and actors' strikesThough an inarguably accomplished musician, with more than 30 studio albums and membership in the Country Music Hall of Fame, McEntire isn’t here to nitpick the technical aspects of the contestants’ performances
 Instead, she'll “support and encourage and help in any way I possibly can,” she says
That means nurturing them as performers by imparting “life lessons you can use in anything you go forward with
 While I have their attention, I want to give them that 


 advice from life experiences that they can use,” she says
 “The music and melody (are) technical things that I don't have
 I'm not a perfectionist, so it doesn't really bother me if it's a little flat or sharp
"“If your heart and soul is in it and I felt something, we've done our job
”McEntire's talent for encouraging young musicians is apparent as she coaches the contestants ahead of Season 23's Battles
 The most common question they ask of her is what to do about nerves
It starts with wearing comfortable shoes, and a positive mindset and confidence – they should make sure to have fun
 But if all else fails, "the crowd loves a boo boo," she says, telling a story about how a slip-up she made during a concert turned into a fun, impromptu experience with that crowd
McEntire's initial hesitation in joining "The Voice" years ago was that she'd discourage talented musicians when they don't advance in the show
 But she now has a different perspective
"They're going to win whether they win this competition or not
 Being in front of this many people, the exposure that they're getting: Unfathomable," she says
 "When I got started, there wasn't anything like this
 And you just had to continue singing wherever you could because you never know who's going to be in the audience
"Although it's unclear whether the “Fancy” singer will bring home a win in her first season as a coach, McEntire will be back for Season 25 next spring, joining Legend and Chance the Rapper as well as rookies Dan + Shay
“I mean, who wouldn't wanna hang out with folks like that?” McEntire says

What's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the dayHollywood screenwriters and studios have reached a tentative agreement to end the writers strike that has brought the TV and movie industry to a standstill for nearly five months
The Writers Guild of America announced the deal late Sunday with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the group that represents studios, streaming services and producers in negotiations
"The WGA and AMPTP have reached a tentative agreement," the Writers Guild West posted Sunday on X, formerly Twitter
 "This was made possible by the enduring solidarity of WGA members and extraordinary support of our union siblings who stood with us for over 146 days
"The three-year contract agreement must be approved by the guild's board and members before the strike officially ends
 There is still no deal between Hollywood actors and the studios; the 160,000-member Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has been on strike since July
SAG-AFTRA congratulated the WGA negotiators in a statement posted Sunday
"We look forward to reviewing the terms of the WGA and AMPTP's tentative agreement," the actors union statement said
 "And we remain ready to resume our own negotiations with the AMPTP as soon as they are prepared to engage on our proposals in a meaningful way
"President Joe Biden weighed in Monday with a statement from the White House applauding the agreement "that will allow writers to return to the important work of telling the stories of our nation, our world
"After months of stalled talks, the prolonged writers strike surged to an agreement after a rare joint meeting Sept
 20 between union officials and four top media CEOs: Disney's Bob Iger, Warner Bros
 Discovery's David Zaslav, NBCUniversal Studio Group's Donna Langley and Netflix's Ted Sarandos
The marathon meetings continued through the weekend, leading to Sunday's breakthrough announcement
The writers strike began May 3 after 11,500 WGA members stopped working when their contract expired, beginning the first writers strike since the 100-day walkout in 2007-08
 SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood actors union, voted to join screenwriters on the picket lines July 14 in the first joint strike in more than six decades
Screenwriters have fought for increased pay and over the size of diminished writing staffs on shows in the streaming era, as well as issues such as the use of artificial intelligence in creating scripts
 TV and movie production has been brought to a halt as a result of the work stoppage
 All the TV late-night shows, staffed by writers who create monologues and jokes for their hosts, immediately went dark, including NBC's "The Tonight Show," Comedy Central's "The Daily Show," ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" and CBS' "Late Show With Stephen Colbert
"Daytime talk shows such as "The Drew Barrymore Show," "The Jennifer Hudson Show" and CBS' "The Talk" stopped production
 All three TV shows had made plans to restart production earlier this month amid the strike but reversed themselves after social media backlash and picketers
 A settlement would mean they can resume airing immediately
When will it end?Hollywood holds its breath as dual actors, writers' strike drags onNetworks rearranged their fall TV schedules to deal with the lack of new shows, filling prime time with reruns, reality and game shows
 If a strike persisted into October, the entire TV season could have been wiped out
Now, if the actors follow suit and reach a speedy settlement, production on scripted TV shows could begin in a matter of weeks and new episodes could be ready to air by early next year

Although workers’ annual pay increases have outpaced inflation since May, their spending power has shrunk over the past two years as inflation drove up overall prices by roughly 12%
 Essentials like groceries and utilities have jumped even higher
With high costs eroding millions of household budgets, unions like the United Auto Workers are now starting to push employers to reinstate a once common but now rarer mechanism for ensuring that wages keep up with inflation
COLA, or cost-of-living adjustments to paychecks, are well-known by Social Security recipients, millions of whom live on a fixed income and carefully track the yearly, inflation-adjusted tweaks to their benefits
 But for anyone else, the pay bumps that were baked into many union contracts for decades have fallen away over the last half-century
 The government has even stopped tracking data on them
But COLA is returning to the national conversation
 The striking UAW, in its tense negotiations with automakers, has said it will not accept a contract agreement without a COLA, an unnamed source familiar with the contract talks told the Detroit Free Press, which is part of the USA TODAY network
"(We've seen) very high inflation
 Workers are feeling that pain and they're saying, 'We want to be protected,'” said Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations in New Jersey
COLA provisions used to be common among union contracts, with 61% including them in 1976, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
 Twenty years later, the percentage had dropped to about one-third of that peak level
The 61% included UAW contracts with the Detroit Three automakers (General Motors, Ford and Stellantis – formerly Chrysler), which adopted the wage adjustments in 1948 and 1950
 The provisions followed a spike in inflation, with overall consumer prices up nearly 20% from the year prior in March 1947
 Inflation spiked once again ahead of COLA’s peak in the mid-1970s, with overall consumer prices growing 11
8% year-over-year in January 1975
  The prominence of unions in the 1970s and '80s also helped COLA numbers
 Data from the BLS shows that 20% of American workers were union members in 1983 ‒ the first year for which comparable data are available ‒ versus 10% in 2022
 "When unions were stronger, they were able to fight for COLAs and win them," Givan said
But as union power waned and inflation eased, so did COLA coverage
 By 1995, 22% of union contracts had the provisions, according to BLS data
 The benefit was suspended in UAW contracts with the Detroit Three in 2009 after the automakers faced bankruptcy during the 2008 financial crisis
 While the companies' finances have since bounced back, the COLA clauses have not
 The latest ratified contracts from 2019 show that COLA language was removed from Ford and Chrysler agreements and remains suspended in the GM contract
It’s unclear how many union contracts include COLAs today; BLS stopped collecting data on it after 1995 because of funding restrictions, according to the agency
Experts say they have no reason to believe the cost-of-living adjustments have picked up substantially since then
"I don't have any evidence that it was rebounding before the pandemic," said Harry Katz, a professor of collective bargaining at Cornell University
 COLA clauses were meant to help workers and employers deal with the uncertainty of multi-year contracts
 Instead of both sides trying to predict future inflation rates during wage negotiations, COLA provisions helped them account for any unforeseen consumer price hikes
While data on the prevalence of cost-of-living adjustments today are slim, Katz noted that they don’t make much sense in non-union jobs without multi-year contracts
“I don’t know of an instance where a non-union workforce has a COLA,” he said
 “You’re setting pay annually and you don’t have uncertainty with inflation
 You don’t need a mechanism for that
”Non-union jobs typically do not have guaranteed raises
 Instead, pay increases tend to vary by industry, company, location and job performance
 Eighty percent of organizations surveyed by compensation research and software firm Payscale in late 2022 said they planned to provide base pay increases this year, with 56% planning to give bumps of more than 3%
But data show that U
S
 wages have struggled to keep up with inflation over the past two years
 While average U
S
 wage growth finally began outpacing price increases in May, many Americans say they still haven’t caught up to the big run-up in prices
US wage growth is finally outpacinginflation
 Many Americans aren't feeling it
If the UAW secures a COLA provision in its contract negotiations, that could help “set a new standard” for other union contracts, according to Givan of Rutgers
 “Other workers will also fight for a cost-of-living increase,” she said
 While there’s no good data that shows the current state of COLA provisions, a number of unions have started demanding cost-of-living adjustments in recent months
 Canada’s British Columbia General Employees’ Union and Hospital Employees’ Union, for instance, both secured deals last year that include COLA clauses
  Whether more contracts will include COLA depends on inflation levels and union power, according to Cedric de Leon, a professor of sociology and labor studies at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst
If high inflation continues, “then I would bet that the labor movement continues to explore this sort of older COLA mechanism for addressing that,” he said, adding that an increase in union participation would also make future COLA provisions more likely
 But if inflation continues to ease, then contract negotiators may not prioritize COLA and instead focus on giving employees an overall pay increase
“The thing is that we're living through history,” de Leon said
 “We don’t actually know (what to expect)
 So it's just up in the air
”The electric vehicle industry has been constantly growing, with no signs of slowing down
 Automakers are electrifying large portions of their fleets, and Detroit-based General Motors has has committed to an all-electric fleet by 2040
Helping to boost EV sales is the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed in 2022 that includes financial incentives for the purchase of an electric vehicle
 Americans may be eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an eligible EV
 In addition, some states, and in some cases utility companies, have followed suit, offering incentives for those willing to make the switch to an electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid
Eligibility depends on income and how you plan to use the vehicle
 To claim a credit, a single taxpayer must make no more than $150,000 in modified adjusted gross income
 The limit for couples filing jointly is $300,000, and heads of household must have an AGI of $225,000 or less to qualify
Tax credits are available only on purchases for personal use, not resale, and the vehicle must be used primarily in the U
S
Currently, the incentive for an EV purchase is offered only as a tax credit, meaning a taxpayer would receive the full $7,500 credit only if they paid at least $7,500 in taxes to the federal government
 If a taxpayer paid only $4,000 in taxes but was eligible for the full $7,500 credit, they would receive only a $4,000 credit
Beginning in 2024, EV buyers will be able to transfer the EV credit to the dealer at the point of sale
 That will directly reduce the price of the vehicle by the full credit amount, meaning that if a taxpayer is eligible for a $7,500 credit, the vehicle will be discounted by $7,500
 For now, tax credits can be claimed by filling out the Form 8936 when filing federal taxes
Learn more: Should I buy an EV? Your buying guide on big discounts, tax credits and when to buy
To claim the full $7,500 tax credit, battery components used in an EV must be manufactured or assembled in North America, and crucial minerals in the battery must be sourced from the United States or a country with which the U
S
 has a free-trade agreement, or recycled in North America
If an EV meets only the battery component requirement, it is eligible for a $3,750 credit
 Conversely, if an EV meets only the critical minerals requirement, it is eligible for a $3,750 credit
 Only when both criteria are met is the vehicle eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit
 For vehicles purchased before April 18, 2023, the criteria is different
 If you've purchased a vehicle before that date, find out if you are eligible for the tax credit using this IRS tool
Used electric vehicles are included in the incentives, but the maximum tax credit is $4,000For eligible used EVs, the maximum purchase price on the vehicle must be $25,000 or less
 Claiming your tax credit on a used EV is also not a guarantee
 A used electric vehicle is eligible for a tax credit only if the vehicle did not have a tax credit claimed on it when it was purchased as a new EV
 To find out if your used EV qualifies for a tax credit and how much you may be eligible to receive, check using the Department of Energy's tool
Search for your state in the list below to find out what incentives are available when you purchase an electric vehicle, plug-in hybrid or electric motorcycle
It isn't just vehicles that are eligible for incentives

 Wages have been a big point of contention in ongoing UAW talks, with the union initially seeking a 40% pay increase and the automakers offering about half that percentage over the life of the next contract in their most recent proposals
The union has said the wage request is tied to the percentage increase in CEO compensation over the last four years
 The union has also pointed to the big increase in inflation, saying autoworker wages haven’t come close to keeping pace
So what do United Auto Workers members make? A blog post in August on UAW contracts by Kristin Dziczek, a policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, put the top hourly production wage for UAW members at $32 an hour
 It also put estimated hourly labor costs for the Detroit Three automakers for those workers, including benefits and bonuses, at an estimated $66 per hour this year
What strikers are demanding:UAW demands cost-of-living salary adjustment as Americans feel pinch of inflationUAW strike:'If not now, when?': Here's why the UAW strike may have come at the perfect time for laborThe Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the average hourly wage rate for all production and non-supervisory autoworkers in the United States at $27
99 per hour as of August
 Hourly labor costs, including benefits and expenses, at non-union plants operated by Tesla and foreign transplants are also less than at the Detroit Three, from $45 to $55 per hour, according to recent Free Press reporting, a point that the companies tend to highlight
Not all autoworkers at the Detroit Three come close to the top pay rate of $32 an hour
 Temporary or supplemental workers make less
 Stellantis, for instance, offered in one of its proposals during ongoing contract talks to raise the starting wage for its supplemental workers from $15
78 per hour to $20 per hour, and the company, which says it needs them to fill gaps caused by absenteeism, has thousands of such workers
 Many supplemental workers make around $17 per hour, although the percentage of those making such wages across the industry isn't clear because that information isn't necessarily made public
For permanent production workers who are said to be "in- progression" to top wages, the union wants to eliminate this so-called tiered system, which dates to 2007
 It included lower starting pay and different benefits, such as a 401(k) retirement offering rather than a pension, for workers hired since that time
 The range goes from about $18 an hour up to that top rate of $32, according to Marick Masters, a labor expert and business professor at Wayne State University
Company proposals have included offers to reduce the number of years it takes to reach top pay for these workers from eight years to four
 The union would also like to see supplemental workers rolled over to permanent status in a matter of months rather than allowing them to remain in that role for years in some cases
UAW strike:What Biden's unwavering support for autoworkers in UAW strike says about the 2024 electionAnd as far as compensation to the CEOs − $29 million for GM’s Mary Barra, $21 million for Ford’s Jim Farley and $24
8 million for Stellantis in 2022, as the Free Press recently noted – they weren’t even the highest payout to an individual last year at the companies
That honor appears to go to Mike Manley, the former head of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, who pocketed $54
1 million as part of an agreement inked before the 2021 merger that created Stellantis from FCA and Peugeot maker PSA Group
 Manley left Stellantis in November 2021 to become CEO of AutoNation
At the UAW, President Shawn Fain is expected to make the same amount in annual compensation as his predecessor Ray Curry, according to labor experts
The UAW constitutional provisions on salaries for executive officers is reported in financial disclosure forms
 Based on the 2022 LM-2 financial disclosure, Curry's base compensation that year was slightly over $219,000
 If adding in bonuses and other benefits, it showed a total compensation of $267,000
A spokesman for the UAW would not verify Fain's compensation when asked to do so by the Detroit Free Press

In February, Kia and Hyundai promised new anti-theft software upgrades would help hit the brakes on a dramatic rise in car thefts across the country, fixing a security flaw that made certain models of the two car brands easy to steal
Months later, nearly 80% of the roughly 8

Climate-fueled disasters like Hurricane Ian are wreaking havoc on home values across the nation, but Florida’s messy insurance market makes it one of the most stressed, new research out of a nonprofit climate modeling group indicates
High insurance premiums and a state-backed requirement that homeowners covered by the state-backed insurer of last resort enroll in the National Flood Insurance Program over the next three years could drop home values up to 40% in Florida in the next 30 years, data provided by First Street Foundation shows
 And climate and insurance experts say that may further gentrify Florida’s coastal regions and barrier islands

In Michigan, state leaders are hoping to solve a problem that could have wide-ranging effects on its future −the recent decline of the state population
  Since 2020, the last time the once-in-a-decade U
S
 Census count occurred, Michigan’s population has lost around 40,000 people, census estimates show
 Although the census found Michigan grew in population from 2010 to 2020, that growth still came at a snail’s pace
 Is that too harsh of a description? Numbers say no, Michigan’s population growth ranked second to last among states that gained population over the decade
The 2023 New York Jets experienced a mechanical failure immediately after takeoff
 But there’s still time to land at their desired destination rather than circling back on the same tired flight plan
They just need to do one thing: Trade for quarterback Kirk Cousins – Sunday further illustrating it’s the most sensible move for the NYJ and Minnesota Vikings, Cousins’ employer since 2018
While Aaron Rodgers is recovering from Achilles surgery, the supposedly rehabilitated Zach Wilson is threatening to scuttle a third consecutive Jets season
 He led them to 39 yards in the first half of Sunday’s 15-10 loss to the New England Patriots, who have beaten their supposed AFC East rivals 15 times in a row and are 5-0 against Wilson
 He wound up with 157 yards passing for a constantly stalled offense and wasted another strong defensive showing from the Jets, something he did twice last year against New England
Head coach Robert Saleh continues to seek a positive spin but has little alternative
Right now
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more
"We're still early in the season," Saleh said
 "We knew, even with Aaron at quarterback, there was going to be some hiccups along the way because of a new offense, a new play caller, new O-line, just new players on the offensive side of the ball
“Now you’ve got this curveball that was sent to us, and so they’re acclimating
 They’re gonna get better, but it’s still very early in the season
”And Wilson?“Right now, Zach is the best (quarterback),” said Saleh, “he’s who gives us the best chance to win
”Right now – even Saleh making the qualifierHe can praise Wilson’s improved pocket presence, fundamentals and decision-making all he wants – there was nowhere to go but up in those areas
 What’s unchanged are the results, Wilson’s career record now 8-16
 And his talented supporting cast again appears frustrated with Wilson at the helm, this franchise looking ever more likely to waste another season of needed progression for its young core while Rodgers heals
Among qualified passers, Wilson's was the NFL's lowest rated in 2022 (72
8)
 This year? He's at 57
0
 Since his rookie year in 2021, his 69
2 QB rating, 54
9% completion rate and 17-22 TD-to-INT ratio are all worst in the NFL
 The league's least-efficient passing game prevented the Jets, who started 7-4 last year, from reaching postseason
So why not send Wilson, 24, and, say, two third-round picks – the Jets spent next year’s second-rounder on Rodgers – to the Vikings for Cousins, 35, who’s scheduled to be a free agent at season’s end? With Rodgers vowing to return better than ever, there’s no reason to believe the Jets will pick up Wilson’s fifth-year option next spring
 Yet there is reason to believe a quarterback of Cousins’ caliber – at least as it pertains to regular-season play – could reroute this entire organization in a positive direction culturally, if even as a substitute teacher
Cousins wouldn’t necessarily have to drive the bus for a team that’s (yet again) just seemingly a quarterback away – and you wouldn't expect him to immediately if he parachutes in
 Yet he surely could relatively soon given how well he’s generally played in 2023, “KFC” becoming the fifth player in league history with at least 325 passing yards and multiple TD passes in the first three games of a season
 He’s also got a big brain – yes, prone to occasional vapor lock on the field – but one that can synthesize a playbook quickly enough and a former Vikings teammate (running back Dalvin Cook) who could help with the onboarding process
 And pulling the Jets (1-2) out of what has all the appearances of another nosedive would be great free agency marketing for Cousins, who – no matter what you think of him as a player – has proven he's one of the greatest businessmen the league's ever seen
Isn’t that a much better alternative than Wilson – or Carson Wentz or Matt Ryan, free agents whom Fox Sports reported Sunday have reached out to the Jets (Ryan later denied interest) – for a squad that needs to learn how to win, not go 7-10, ahead of Rodgers’ expected return?As for the Vikings … right now?They’re 0-3 following Sunday’s crushing defeat to the Los Angeles Chargers, Minnesota consistently losing heartbreakers – all of its defeats by six points or fewer – after going 11-0 in one-score affairs in a charmed voyage to the NFC North throne in 2022
 Based on a sample size going back to the NFL’s last expansion in 2002, the probability the Vikings won’t reach the playoffs this season now stands at 99%
So why not deal Cousins, whom the team opted not to re-up contractually over the summer? He can’t be franchised, his restructured deal voiding after the 2024 deadline to tag players
 Besides, the Vikings have already been maneuvering out of veteran contracts (Cook, Adam Thielen, Eric Kendricks) to extend core players like Pro Bowl tight end T
J
 Hockenson, knowing full well they’ll almost certainly be backing up a Brinks truck for generational wideout Justin Jefferson next year
And with this season effectively over? You immediately get useful draft capital from the Jets rather than lose Cousins for nothing more than one eventual compensatory pick while giving Wilson a change of scenery, the best receiver in the league, a reliable tight end and a leader, Kevin O’Connell, who made his bones coaching up quarterbacks
 Maybe Wilson finally puts it together and morphs into the player he was projected to be as the No
 2 pick of the 2021 draft – a long-term win for the Vikings
 Maybe Wilson’s spiral continues, and he drags the Vikes to a 3-14 record – quite likely a long-term win for the Vikings if it puts them in position to draft 2022 Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Caleb Williams
J-E-T-S
 Skol
 For two franchises currently taking differing routes to a similar destination – mediocrity – this is a deal that could be a win-win course correction for both

The NFL Week 3 slate, at first glance, appeared to lack some sizzle
Sunday, though, did offer some compelling revelations and rather unexpected outcomes
None was more surprising than the Arizona Cardinals hosting the potent Dallas Cowboys and pulling off the upset despite being double-digit underdogs in what could eventually become a culture-setting victory
Elsewhere, the Dolphins routed the Denver Broncos in a historic blowout that saw Miami drop the most points − 70 − of any team in a single game since 1966
And in the NFC North, the Green Bay Packers took advantage of a savvy analytics play while the defining trait of the Minnesota Vikings this season is that they give the ball away
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more
Here are the winners and losers from Sunday of Week 3
At this point, there’s not much of a debate: Miami has the best offense in football
 Thing is, it’s not really close
 Through three games, the Dolphins have gained 1,651 yards on 197 offensive snaps for an absurd average of 8
4 yards per play
 The next closest team, the Vikings, are at 6
2 yards per play
 Miami is finding relatively affordable gems, particularly in its backfield
 De’Von Achane broke out against the Broncos and is on a third-round rookie contract
 Veteran Raheem Mostert is also on an affordable deal
At every level of the offense, Miami has prioritized speed
 And when combined with the creative plays coach Mike McDaniel draws up — look no further than the pair of no-look shovel-pass touchdowns to Achane — the Dolphins have an offense that puts them in the Super Bowl conversation … as long as they stay healthy
 And one last point: Miami did all this with star receiver Jaylen Waddle (concussion) inactive
The Cardinals, 12
5-point underdogs entering Sunday, led wire-to-wire against the Cowboys, the team that had entered Week 3 looking like the most complete outfit in the entire NFL
 For rookie coach Jonathan Gannon, it’s his first career victory and a massive one
 Arizona’s roster simply is not as talented as Dallas’, but games like this can help recalibrate the culture of a program that has been stuck in mediocrity for some time
The Cardinals held the Cowboys to just one conversion in the red zone on five attempts
 They rolled up 400 total yards — 222 of them on the ground — and dropped 28 points on the defense that came into Sunday ranked first in both total defense (193 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (5
0 points allowed per game)
 The Cowboys previously hadn’t allowed any team to convert in the red zone; Arizona did it twice in both its attempts
The other former Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator who got hired to a head coaching job is also enjoying success as a rookie coach
 Steichen took Indianapolis on the road and upset a very good Baltimore Ravens team in a gritty showing without athletic rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson (concussion)
 Baltimore came into Week 3 ranked sixth in the NFL in rushing defense (69 yards per game allowed) but Colts running back Zack Moss ripped off 122 yards on the ground
There was a non-call on an obvious pass interference late in overtime that benefited the Colts but that should not take away from this victory
 Kicker Matt Gay made history with four field goals of 50-plus yards and backup quarterback Gardner Minshew was steady (if unspectacular)
 The most impressive part of the Indy victory, though, was a secondary that clamped down on Baltimore’s revamped receiving outfit and held Baltimore to only 178 passing yards
There’s a line of thinking in contemporary analytical circles that suggests teams facing a 14-point deficit should go for two when they score their first touchdown in a comeback attempt
 The reasoning: If the team converts, then another touchdown (and assuming a conversion on the resulting extra point) will give the team the lead
 Yet, if the two-point attempt fails, then the subsequent touchdown would still allow for the chance to tie the game with a second-two point attempt
That’s exactly what Packers coach Matt LaFleur did when Green Bay scored 18 unanswered to erase a 17-point deficit and topple New Orleans
 LaFleur’s move took advantage of the momentum the Packers gained and the Saints losing theirs after quarterback Derek Carr went down with a shoulder injury
 It also helped young quarterback Jordan Love build resilience after his most uneven start (22-of-44 for 259 yards with one touchdown and one interception) of this season
Las Vegas Raiders coach Josh McDaniels got the gift of a bailout from his odd coaching decision to attempt a field goal with 3:15 to play in the game against the Pittsburgh Steelers while trailing by eight
 A Steelers personal foul on the (successful) attempt extended the drive and the Raiders actually marched the ball all the way down to the Pittsburgh eight-yard line
 But, when faced with a fourth-and-4, McDaniels — again — opted for the field goal
 Daniel Carlson converted it
 Vegas trailed by five
But by accepting the penalty and not trying for the touchdown later in the drive, the Raiders essentially got the same result, but with 50 fewer seconds on the game clock
 Then there’s the issue of — assuming the defense held — forcing the Vegas offense to drive the length of the field because, regardless of the field goal, a touchdown was needed to win
The Raiders would indeed get the ball back
 The problem? They got it with 12 seconds left, from their own 15-yard line
 Jimmy Garoppolo would throw his third interception of the night on the following play
They entered 2023 with a fair amount of buzz
 Quarterback Trevor Lawrence received some preseason MVP love, and the Jaguars were widely projected to be the winners of the AFC South
 So far, however, Doug Pederson’s Jacksonville Jaguars look more like a team stuck in a rebuild, and one that has offensively regressed
While there’s no question Jacksonville can still take the division, a 20-point loss to a Texans team that is inexperienced and lacking star power, especially on offense, calls the Jaguars’ direction into question
 Namely, Lawrence, now in his third season and coming off of a Pro Bowl campaign, simply hasn’t developed a consistent rapport with Calvin Ridley, Christian Kirk or Evan Engram
 Among qualifying quarterbacks, Lawrence ranks 23rd in QB rating (84
5) and has thrown only three touchdown passes
If not for turnovers, the Vikings wouldn’t be winless
 Yet, after another day of careless ball protection, Minnesota finds itself 0-3 and in serious danger of having its season implode
 In a loss against the Chargers, tight end T
J
 Hockenson lost a fumble — the team’s seventh of the season — and Kirk Cousins tossed a pick off a deflected pass to Hockenson that ended the comeback bid
 The seven fumbles and -7 turnover differential are worst in the league
It could’ve been worse
 Late in the second quarter with the game tied, the Vikings were charging and inside the 5-yard line
 Running back Alexander Mattison got a carry and plunged forward and appeared to have the ball stripped with a clear Chargers recovery except that the officials questionably ruled that Mattison’s forward progress had been halted
 Even on defense, cornerback Akayleb Evans bobbled an interception that fell into Chargers receiver Joshua Palmer’s grasp for a 30-yard touchdown
 It would prove to be the final score of the game and the one that gave the Chargers the game-winning lead
The aura around Washington Commanders quarterback Sam Howell, who came into Sunday having thrown just one interception on the season, lost its luster in a blowout loss against the Bills Bills
 Howell threw four picks (including one that was returned for a score) and was otherwise ineffective
 To be fair, the entire Washington squad was ineffective
 The offensive line yielded constant pressure that did not allow Howell to get settled
 The Bills pressured Howell on 62
9% of his dropbacks
 They collected nine sacks and hit him 15 times, many of those coming on obvious passing situations
 Not surprisingly, the Commanders converted just one of their nine third-down attempts
Howell will have other attempts to prove his worth as a viable starter
 In many ways, with Howell making his fourth career start, a game like this was to be expected
 It can’t become a pattern
The 32 things we learned from Week 3 of the 2023 NFL season:1
 Being a one-percenter might be a dream for most, but not in the context of the NFL
 Entering Sunday, of the 100 teams to start 0-3 since the league expanded to 32 clubs in 2002, exactly one – the 2018 Houston Texans – recovered to reach the playoffs
 That means, yes, a 1% shot for the Carolina Panthers, Chicago Bears, Denver Broncos, Minnesota Vikings and possibly the Cincinnati Bengals (0-2), who host the Los Angeles Rams on Monday night
 Of the 32 teams to even start 0-2 since 2019, Cincy (last year) is the only one to salvage a postseason berth
2
 In the NFL, you want to be an 86-percenter
 Entering Sunday, 12 of the past 14 teams to start 3-0 extended their seasons into the playoffs
 That’s very encouraging news for the unbeaten Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers, who (barring a tie) will be joined by either the Philadelphia Eagles or Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday night
2a
 Overall, though, rough weekend for the undefeated, five 2-0 clubs losing Sunday
3
 But speaking of one-percenters, how about Taylor Swift showing up at Arrowhead Stadium to root on new (rumored) beau Travis Kelce, who scored a TD in the Kansas City Chiefs’ 41-10 demolition of the Bears?NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more
4
 Hopefully for Swift and (mostly) Kelce this goes well 


 though a rematch of Super Bowl 57 could be problematic given Swift is a Pennsylvania native and Eagles fan
 It may be a “You Belong With Me” “Love Story” right now, but could it end with “Bad Blood”? Sunday went well, but it’s hard not to flash back to that Tony Romo-Jessica Simpson debacle if you’re a Chiefs fan
4a
 To be clear Swifties and Kelce admirers, we openly acknowledge your idols are at the tops of their chosen professions in ways Romo and Simpson never were
5
 Speaking again of one-percenters, give it up for Kansas City head coach Andy Reid, who won his 271st game (including playoffs) Sunday, moving him past Dallas Cowboys legend Tom Landry and into fourth place all-time
6
 As for the – uh, 99-percenters? – the Bears' franchise-record 13-game losing streak only begins to spotlight their misery on a day when QB Justin Fields was horrible in the wake of his blame-the-coaching news conference last week
 After vowing to play more instinctively, he passed for 99 yards and rushed for 47 as Chicago was embarrassed yet again
7
 Maybe Da Bears will win a game at some point
 But until that time, gonna be hard to top the Arizona Cardinals’ handling of the previously undefeated Cowboys in a 28-16 victory that could end up rating as the upset of the season
 Losing CB Trevon Diggs to a season-ending ACL injury in the days before the game was a blow, but no excusing this setback for America’s Team and its vaunted defense to a Cards squad that lacks the talent of the flawed Jets and Giants, Dallas’ first two victims of the season
8
 Back to the Fins … seventy-burger? Seriously? You guys know this isn’t the BCS, and no style points are awarded, yeah? (Net points are a low-level tiebreaker, but I digress
) Regardless, what an obviously impressive performance as Miami became the fourth NFL team to reach the 70-point plateau in the Dolphins’ 70-20 dismantling of the Broncos, the most points scored by a team since Washington had 72 in 1966
8a
 Wondering if former Denver coach Nathaniel Hackett cares to weigh in on poor coaching jobs 


9
 The Dolphins’ 726 total yards are a record for one team in the Super Bowl era (since 1966)
 They averaged 10
2 – more than a first down – per snap
 Miami had four plays exceeding 50 yards and four others that went for at least 20
10
 Dolphins RBs Raheem Mostert and rookie De’Von Achane had four TDs apiece, the second pair of teammates to achieve that in a game
 Achane also rushed for 203 yards on 18 carries
11
 Elsewhere, in a game that was entertaining for different reasons, the Los Angeles Chargers and Vikings both piled up 475 yards, though it was the Bolts who outlasted HC Brandon Staley’s decision making and the Vikes for a 28-24 triumph in what was effectively an elimination game between clubs that started Sunday 0-2
12
 Staley’s team secured the victory thanks to LB Kenneth Murray’s end-zone interception with 7 seconds left, absolving the coach of his (failed) decision to go for it on fourth-and-1 from his own 24-yard line – on a day when his team rushed for all of 30 yards without injured RB Austin Ekeler – in a bid to end the game
13
 Chargers WR Keenan Allen caught 18 passes for 215 yards and threw a 49-yard TD pass to Mike Williams
 Allen’s 18 catches were the most ever by a player who also threw for a touchdown, surpassing the previous standard by six grabs
14
 Vikings WR Justin Jefferson finished with seven grabs for 149 yards and a TD
 He finished 1 yard shy of becoming the first player to ever start a season with three consecutive 150-yard receiving games, but his 458 total yards tied Wes Welker’s mark for the most ever through three weeks
15
 Minnesota is 0-3 despite not losing any of its games by more than six points
 The defending NFC North champions were 11-0 in one-score games in 2022
16
 The Vikings have lost seven fumbles this season
 Seven
17
 The New England Patriots have now beaten the reeling New York Jets 15 consecutive times
 Fifteen
18
 How much longer can the NYJ wait to go quarterback shopping before another season with Zach Wilson goes down the chute? (Answer: Not long, despite what the Jets are saying publicly
)19
 The Buffalo Bills defense served reminder that this isn’t just the Josh Allen Show
 Even with LB Von Miller (knee) at least weeks away from returning, Buffalo hung nine sacks, five takeaways and one pick-six on the previously unbeaten Washington Commanders, who managed all of 230 yards in a 37-3 rout
20
 In a game marred by the remnants of Tropical Storm Ophelia, the Indianapolis Colts returned to their birthplace and beat the Baltimore Ravens 22-19 in overtime
 Upstaging legendary K Justin Tucker, who was short on what would have been a game-winning 61-yard field goal at the end of regulation, the Colts’ Matt Gay became the first man in league annals to hit four FGs from 50+ yards in a single game, including the game-winner from 53 with 69 seconds left
21
 The matchup – and the victory – of 2023 first-round running backs goes to the Detroit Lions’ Jahmyr Gibbs, who finished with 82 yards from scrimmage on 18 touches in Sunday’s 20-6 win against the previously unbeaten Falcons
 Atlanta counterpart Bijan Robinson was limited to 60 yards on 14 touches after averaging nearly 130 total yards in his first two games
22
 But the best rookie between the lines Sunday at Ford Field was Lions second-round TE Sam LaPorta (8 catches, 84 yards, TD)
22a
 LaPorta’s 18 receptions in his first three NFL games establish a new record for tight ends
23
 We’re not saying Cleveland Browns QB Deshaun Watson takes our (on-field) advice, but maybe? Despite the loss of Pro Bowl RB Nick Chubb to season-ending knee surgery, Watson responded with his best performance as a Brown, connecting on 27 of 33 throws for 289 yards and two scores
 He distributed the ball nicely in Cleveland's 27-3 runaway against the Tennessee Titans, hooking up at least twice with a half-dozen receivers
 Watson’s 123
4 passer rating was his best with Cleveland and only the second time in nine starts with the Browns that he’s topped 100
0
 He had a 104
5 career mark during his time in Houston
23a
 Browns DE Myles Garrett had 3½ sacks, one shy of his personal best in the NFL
24
 Green Bay Packers OLB Rashan Gary had a career-high three sacks, one injuring the throwing shoulder of Saints QB Derek Carr, in the Pack’s 18-17 defeat of New Orleans
 Expect Gary to be a highly sought commodity in next year’s free-agent market
24a
 The Saints were up 17 when Carr suffered what's apparently a sprained shoulder in the third quarter
25
 Consequently, Green Bay doesn’t win its 11th consecutive home opener if new QB1 Jordan Love hadn’t rallied the Packers out of what became a 17-0 fourth-quarter hole
 Sunday was Love’s first career start at Lambeau Field
26
 Las Vegas Raiders HC Josh McDaniels went full Staley on Sunday night, opting to take a field goal off the board – maybe understandable given the eight-point deficit – and extend a drive late in the fourth quarter that 


 ended with a field goal nearly a minute later
 The Silver and Black eventually got the ball back with 12 seconds left, enough time for QB Jimmy Garoppolo to serve up his third pick in a 23-18 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers
 Maybe Jimmy G
 could have been more judicious with, say, another 50 seconds to work with had McDaniels simply taken the three points the first time?27
 Titans WR DeAndre Hopkins has at least one catch in all 154 of his NFL appearances, including all 148 in the regular season
 His streak of consecutive games with at least a reception is currently the league’s longest
27a
 That's barely halfway to Hall of Famer Jerry Rice’s all-time record (274)
28
 The home-field advantage at Seattle’s Lumen Field remains real, the Panthers committing eight false starts in their 37-27 loss Sunday
29
 One of the NFL’s more inexplicable subplots? The Jacksonville Jaguars’ inability to handle the AFC South rival Houston Texans, who won their fifth straight in Duval County
 The Jags have dropped 10 of their last 11 (and 16 of 19) to Houston
30
 The Texans did produce, arguably, the most memorable play of Week 3, FB Andrew Beck returning a kickoff 85 yards for a score
 The unlikely hero, at 255 pounds, became the heaviest player in league history to score on a kickoff
31
 With the Texans’ DeMeco Ryans and Cardinals’ Jonathan Gannon getting their first career victories, the Broncos’ Sean Payton and Panthers’ Frank Reich – both established head coaches – are the only new ones this year who are still winless
32
 All due respect to Beck, but our favorite moment of Week 3 was former Colts QB Andrew Luck showing up for Prime Video’s postgame show at Levi's Stadium in full Civil War regalia

Seventy? Wow
The Miami Dolphins put up a 70-20 whupping on the Denver Broncos that was more rare than a hybrid solar eclipse
Quick, when was the last time an NFL team scored – or gave up – 70?You’d have to go back 57 years, to 1966, when the Washington team blasted the Giants, 72-41
 At least the G-Men scored a few of their own on that November afternoon
But this?NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more
Sorry, Sean Payton
 Your Broncos are not a playoff team
 Not now
 Guess you’ll be pissed, unless your team can rally from an 0-3 start to fulfill your preseason expectation
The good news: It only counts as one loss for Denver
 Miami was a heavy favorite and Denver’s defense played without injured safety Justin Simmons and edge rusher Frank Clark
 So, it was going to be tough regardless against MVP contender Tua Tagovailoa, The Cheetah (Tyreek Hill) and the serious scheming of whiz kid Mike McDaniel
 But to lose in such a fashion – like a Power Five school hosting a Football Championship Subdivision team – is an embarrassment that suggests a whole lot of quit
Then again, as convincingly lopsided as it was, it may not have been the worst loss on a Blowout Sunday in the NFL
 There are too many candidates for worst loss:All that, and the Minnesota Vikings' 28-24 home loss against the Los Angeles Chargers deserves special consideration
 The Vikings rallied back from an 11-point deficit in the second half, fell behind again late in the fourth quarter, then blew a gift-wrapped opportunity to pull it out at the end
In a matchup of winless teams, the suspect game management in crunch time seemed to suggest that both teams were chasing 0-3
Chargers coach Brandon Staley, whose fingerprints are on that enormous playoff loss at Jacksonville in the wild-card round in January (they lost after leading 27-0), went for it on fourth-and-1 from L
A
’s 24-yard line with under two minutes to play
For who? For what? Staley’s gamble to seal the game with a fourth-down run backfired
 Hugely
He could have, no, should have punted to at least force Minnesota to drive the length of the field
The Vikings, though, proved to be just as sorry at game management as they squandered the gift of great field position
 Inexplicably, the Vikings, with zero timeouts and under a minute to play, proceeded to waste roughly 30 seconds by not spiking the ball to stop the clock after a 9-yard completion to tight end T
J
 Hockenson set up a first-and-goal at the 6
Instead, they rushed the play – another throw to the tight end as the clock ticked to 12 seconds
 Kirk Cousins should know better
 And the sequence was even worse as it ended when a double-tipped pass to the goal line was intercepted in the end zone by linebacker Kenneth Murray with seven seconds to play
What a bad way to lose
No, the Vikings were not alone
 There was plenty of company with that theme
The moderators of the Republican primary debate expect some sparks to fly at the Reagan Library when candidates try to prove they’re the best one to take on former President Donald Trump
“All of them will be looking for a breakout moment or multiple moments,” Fox Business anchor Stuart Varney said
 “This is a very good chance for them to stand out and establish momentum ahead of the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary
”Fox News anchor Dana Perino, who will join Varney and Univision anchor Ilia Calderón at the moderators’ table, stressed the importance of Wednesday’s event at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum in Simi Valley
 The debate will be televised live at 6 p
m
 Pacific on Fox Business Network and Univision
 It will also stream on Rumble, the right-leaning, video-sharing platform
“This debate is where the rubber meets the road," Perino said
 "One of them has to show they can be the main rival to Trump
”The six candidates who have qualified so far for the debate are Florida Gov
 Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former Vice President Mike Pence, South Carolina Sen
 Tim Scott, former South Carolina Gov
 Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Gov
 Chris Christie
 Two other candidates — Arkansas Gov
 Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Gov
 Doug Burgum — have until Monday to meet the GOP requirements to participate
Trump announced last week that he did not plan to join the debate stage
“Nikki Haley benefitted the most from the first debate,” Perino said, referring to the Milwaukee GOP event in August
 But she added that it remains to be seen who will be the main rival for Trump, the frontrunner who wasn’t in Milwaukee and won’t be in Simi Valley
Varney said he will encourage a robust debate among the candidates at the Reagan Library
“I will look for questions directed to a specific candidate, knowing that another candidate has an opposing point of view," he said
Each candidate gets 60 seconds to answer a moderator’s question, Varney said
 If a candidate criticizes an opponent, the other candidate gets 30 seconds to respond, which is when Varney expects some sparks to fly
When asked about the likelihood of candidates talking over each other, Varney said, “We have a very loud buzzer
 It’s up to us to retain control
 The audience does not want a free-for-all
”Varney said the Fox Business Network research department will watch for any factual mistakes by the candidates and report them to the moderators through their earpieces
 But he added he expects the candidates will correct each other
Although the debate will air on Fox Business Network, Varney said the questions won’t be limited to the economy
“Far from it,” Varney said
 “People who watch this debate want to know where the candidates stand on other issues: immigration, crime, China and Ukraine
“And we’ll throw in a few surprise questions,” he said
Perino said the economy will influence various issues
“An example would be that many candidates believe, as Ronald Reagan, did in a strong national defense
 You need a strong economy for a strong national defense or to fight crime or for a good education,” she said
Varney, who along with Perino isn’t revealing any questions in advance, said he wouldn’t be surprised if Trump and his four indictments or the indictment of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, is discussed
And the symbolism of the debate site — the Reagan Library — isn’t lost on either moderator
“The candidates want to have the Reagan reputation placed on themselves
 I wonder if they can do it,” said Varney, a 75-year-old native of Derby, England and graduate of the London School of Economics
He pointed to the difference between Reagan and candidates such as Trump
“Reagan was not a populist
 He was a classic conservative — low-tax, low-regulation,” said Varney, who hosted programs on CNN and CNBC before joining the Fox News business team in 2004
“I remember watching Reagan debating Jimmy Carter in 1980,” Varney said
 “He asked (of viewers), ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago?’ That was a winning moment
”Perino said she has done a couple book signings at the Reagan Library and has participated in the library’s annual Reagan National Defense Forum
 “I love it there
”Wednesday will mark the first time Perino has been a moderator of a presidential debate, and she said she has picked up some tips from Fox News anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, who moderated the debate in Milwaukee
“I have to remind myself there’s a team to help me, from excellent researchers to the folks in wardrobe,” Perino said
 “I’m not doing it alone
”The 51-year-old Evanston, Wyoming native, grew up in Denver, where her father encouraged her to read the Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News
 “He had me choose two articles each day to discuss with him
”After various reporting jobs in broadcasting, Perino worked her way up from spokesperson at the U
S
 Department of Justice Department to press secretary for President George W
 Bush
Perino said Bush praised her for briefing him so well before press conferences that he was never surprised by any of the reporters’ questions
“It was the honor of a lifetime,” Perino said about her White House job

The campaign reboots haven't worked
 Gov
 Ron DeSantis continues to drop in the polls
 Now the second GOP presidential primary debate is approaching on Wednesday, and a big question is whether it even matters
Is there anything DeSantis can do at this point to change the dynamic in a race where former President Donald Trump's lead grows more daunting with each new poll?Many Republicans thought DeSantis did well in the first debate
 A poll of GOP debate watchers showed DeSantis was viewed as one of the winners
It didn't matter
 Trump has continued to expand his lead,A Quinnipiac University survey released Sept
 13 had Trump up by 50 percentage points nationally, an incredible margin
"The red lights are flashing, the wagons are circled, there’s trouble in River City," said Quinnipiac polling analyst Tim Malloy
Quinnipiac showed a much closer race in February, with DeSantis at 36% support and Trump at 42%
 The pollster's latest survey shows just 12% of GOP voters back DeSantis
“To put it bluntly, he’s dropping like a rock," Malloy said
DeSantis has struggled since formally entering the presidential race in May during a glitch-filled announcement on X, the platform formally known as Twitter
 He has fired campaign staff amid concerns about overspending and switched campaign managers
With his campaign in turmoil, there was intense pressure on DeSantis to deliver a strong performance during the first GOP presidential debate last month
 The governor didn't generate much buzz during the event in Milwaukee, avoiding mixing it up with the other candidates, but a survey released after the event by the Washington Post, FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos found that a plurality of GOP voters thought DeSantis won
Regardless, DeSantis' poll numbers haven't improved and multiple recent surveys show Trump strengthening his position in the race
Emerson College released a national poll Wednesday that had Trump beating DeSantis by 47 percentage points, the largest margin in more than a year of Emerson polling the race
DeSantis is at 12% support in the latest Emerson poll, compared to 29% in January
"Probably most concerning is that 12% has been stagnant for the better part of a month," said Spencer Kimball, executive director of the Emerson College Polling Center
 "August and September have seen him pre-debate and post debate sitting on that
"Kimball said it's not clear a good debate performance would significantly benefit DeSantis, or any other candidate, at this point because Trump's support is so strong, but a bad performance could knock him out of second place
“The rest of the field is starting to pull into DeSantis, the concern for DeSantis is that a bad debate performance would drop him," Kimball said
DeSantis has shrugged off his bad national polling numbers, noting that the primary process plays out at the state level
“We don’t have a national primary and if we had a national primary we would have a different approach, it’s a state by state process," DeSantis said recently on Fox Business
 "Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first opening salvos and I can tell you those are much different pictures on the ground there than what some of the national narrative is
"Yet Trump still holds a commanding lead in Iowa, where DeSantis only is doing slightly better than he is nationally
Emerson's latest survey has DeSantis down by 35 percentage points in Iowa
“Trump’s got a strong lead in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina," Kimball said of the first three states to vote
DeSantis' New Hampshire campaign is looking particularly weak, with the University of New Hampshire/CNN releasing a poll Wednesday that had Florida's governor in fifth place behind Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley and Chris Christie
 The headline of the news release accompanying the poll: "Trump leads, DeSantis Crashes in NH GOP Primary
"DeSantis led Trump by 12 percentage points in a January poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire
"The cultural campaign he has been waging simply doesn't resonate with New Hampshire Republicans," Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, told the Washington Examiner
 "I am still surprised he's pushing anti-woke rhetoric in New Hampshire
"In addition to the polling data, there are other warning signs for DeSantis' campaign
Ken Griffin, a billionaire who was DeSantis' second largest donor when he ran for re-election as governor last year, said in a recent CNBC interview that he is "still on the sidelines as to who to support in this election cycle
" Griffin isn't supporting DeSantis at this point
“I don’t know his strategy,” Griffin said of DeSantis
 “It’s not clear to me what voter base he is intending to appeal to
”DeSantis has tried to challenge Trump from the right and appeal to the most conservative elements of the GOP
 After initially trying to run a national campaign, he has retrenched and devoted much of his time and resources to campaigning in Iowa, which has a large base of conservative, Evangelical voters
DeSantis is hoping to use Iowa as a springboard, and is highlighting issues such his support for a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy as he tries to appeal to Iowa conservatives
Yet Kimball noted that Emerson's polling shows that Iowa voters who care most about the abortion issue and would like to see a complete ban still favor Trump, who recently attracted attention for calling DeSantis' six-week abortion ban a "terrible thing
""On the abortion issue, the data doesn’t suggest that’s going to move enough votes," Kimball said
University of Iowa Political Science Professor Tim Hagle believes DeSantis likely is doing better in Iowa than the polls suggest
 The state is difficult to poll because of its caucus system, he said, and DeSantis is investing enormous resources to ensure voters turn out to caucus for him
“DeSantis is doing the groundwork that we usually like to see in Iowa for the caucuses," Hagle said
Hagle also noted that polling tends to shift in Iowa as the caucus gets closer, and he believes Trump's abortion comments could hurt him with evangelicals
 Then there's Gov
 Kim Reynolds, who is weighing endorsing DeSantis, according to a recent Bloomberg article
Reynolds' backing would be a big win for DeSantis, who could tap into her extensive political network in the state
 It also would signal that she believes he had a good chance of winning the state
“With Reynolds, she won very handily back in November for re-election and seems to be very popular in the state and has a good campaign organization," Hagle said
 "If she could put that to work for DeSantis that’s going to give DeSantis


 a boost
”Despite his struggles, DeSantis still is viewed as the main alternative to Trump, Kimball noted
 Additionally, there still is a considerable amount of time to campaign before the Iowa caucus on Jan
 15 and Trump's legal troubles are a big wild card in the race
“There’s a lot of golf to play here and there’s a hurricane of controversy swirling around Trump," Malloy said
 "So far it hasn’t hurt him… you wonder what - if any - impact it will have
"DeSantis projected optimism during his Fox Business appearance
"We got a long way to go," he said
 "We’re going to work very, very hard
”WASHINGTON — Yes, the 2024 presidential election might be a repeat of 2020, with voters choosing between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump
 That doesn't mean Americans don't have other names in mind
A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll from June found that in a potential rematch between the two current frontrunners, 34% of voters said they would support Biden while 32% said they would support Trump
 Meanwhile, 23% of voters say they would support an unspecified independent contender
Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, told USA TODAY his national surveys indicate about 25% of registered voters across the country say they would vote for someone other than Biden or Trump, or wouldn't vote at all
 It's a trend that has stayed consistent since November 2021
But why are voters dissatisfied with both candidates? Who would voters rather see sworn in as the next president of the United States?Voters from across the political spectrum gave USA TODAY a list of Republican and Democratic officials they'd rather see serve as commander-in-chief
 The options range from progressive Democrats to moderate Republicans, but they're all current or former officials with experience leading
 Here's a closer look
One of the ideal Democratic candidates for some voters USA TODAY interviewed was Sen
 Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass
, who ran for president in 2020 with one of the most progressive agendas in the Democratic field
“She has the wisdom
 She has the policy expertise
 She has consumer expertise, and she has the historical knowledge that I think that she could actually take this country and take it to the next level that we need to go,” said Patricia Holliday, a 66-year-old from Florida who serves on the board for the Capital Medical Society
Holliday said Warren “completely understands” how policy on issues ranging from climate change to women's rights affects everyday citizens, and she could use that insider knowledge to create change
“She has the moral authority," Holliday said
 "She has the energy that is just driving force
"Shreya Dandu, a 21-year-old masters student at George Mason University in Virginia, said she likes that Warren represents a “more progressive wing of the party
”“I really liked her health care plan
 And I think she has a lot of good things to say, and I really like what she did with her past work and…how she would warn people about the 2008 financial crisis, and I feel like she's… on the side of the people,” Dandu said
Dandu added that another ideal presidential candidate for her would be Rep
 Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N
Y
, the youngest woman to serve in Congress who also has a progressive outlook on health care, income inequality and climate change policy
“Speaking as another woman of color, I just love to see someone like her just go into politics, especially because young women of color are very underrepresented…and I really like how she's not afraid to like speak her voice, which I think is really important for a politician, and she's a good role model for younger woman,” Dandu said
But voters haven't completely turned their back on Biden heading into 2024
“He has done more in these four years than I thought was possible, especially given the intense Republican and often unfair Republican opposition to even bipartisan supported bills,” said Spencer Dirrig, a 26-year-old who lives in Ohio and serves as the vice president for the Midwest of the Young Democrats of America
Dirrig said Biden has set his sights on issues that young people care about, including climate change, student debt, and support for unions
 He argued that Biden’s character also sets him apart from other candidates
“Biden isn't just a president who is able to deliver on policy, but he's a president we can look up to," Dirring said
"Frankly, when it comes to all the political drama that we see in the news, when it comes to the former president's social media tweets and attacks on individuals, Joe Biden doesn't mess around with all of that
 He's focused on the job at hand, which is delivering for the American people,” Dirrig said
He also said he thinks concerns about Biden’s age are being blown out of proportion, calling Biden, 80, "the only person who's going to be able to deliver meaningful bipartisan policy wins for young people like me
"The 2024 Republican primary has drawn a long list of candidates
 But that doesn't mean voters aren't hoping a few more potential presidents toss their hat in the ring
Earlier this month, the organization Free Speech for People filed a lawsuit to bar Trump from appearing on Minnesota's ballot in 2024
 One voter involved in the effort, David Thul, said his ideal candidate would be former Texas Rep
 Will Hurd, a vocal critic of Trump who is running in the 2024 race
“Hurd has been outspoken on the deficit issue in the long term federal debt in terms of the need to reduce spending," Thul, a 51-year-old logistics manager, said, also applauding Hurd for his time spent as an undercover CIA officer and his calls to support Ukraine and counter China
"Those are the kind of hot button issues that motivate me in politics,” he added
Tammy Hester, a 52-year-old who lives in Washington, D
C
, said that although she’s a Democrat, her ideal candidate would be former Wyoming Rep
 Liz Cheney
 The former lawmaker has also been outspoken about Trump, and she lost her re-election bid in the 2022 midterms
“I don't agree with her policy but again, I don't necessarily vote on policy because to me that's going to change with every election cycle,” Hester, who works for a federal contracting business, said
 “For me, it's about someone having a moral fiber
""She just has appeared to me to be a person that will at least come to the table and engage in conversations with other parties," Hester said
For 66-year-old Walter Cox, a private chauffeur who lives in California, his ideal candidate would be Utah Sen
 Mitt Romney, who recently announced he would not run for re-election in 2024
 Cox called Romney's legislation in the Senate "a true win-win" for both sides
"That's just who the guy is
 He's open to things
 He's not like ‘it's my way or the highway,’ you know? So I just love that about the guy,” Cox said
Cox said that he believes Romney would be a candidate to bridge the polarizing divide in the country, calling the Utah lawmaker a principled person willing to take “slings and arrows
”“When everyone was against him, he was saying about the Trump impeachment
 He was like, Look, there's enough there that we should look at it
 That's our job as a nation," Cox said
But Trump still appeals to 62-year-old car dealer Francis Wihbey, based in Connecticut, and 70-year-old Daniel Murphy, a retired voter living in Arizona
“I think Trump is a guy that shoots straight,” Murphy said
 “I think he - more than most presidents - has done what he said he was going to do
 And I don't think he has much of a hidden agenda
 And I think he is beyond a doubt here to help the country, not himself, unlike others in government right now
”Not all voters dissatisfied with a choice between Trump and Biden have another option in mind
Paul Beck, professor of political science at The Ohio State University, explained to USA TODAY there is never going to be an ideal candidate for most voters, noting that they "basically settle on who is better than the others," and that may include a mix of positive and negative characteristics
Quentin Wathum-Ocama, the 32-year-old president of the Young Democrats of America and an elementary school educator, told USA TODAY that “I think a lot of voters and I think a lot of my cohort - millennials and Gen Z - they're really just looking for someone who's gonna talk about their issues
"He said he would want somebody who recognizes climate change and is willing to stand up for worker’s rights
“We want people - when they have that working majority in the government - to take on those big and bold ideas,” Wathum-Ocama said
 “I think that's what I'm looking for
”Caiden Anderson, a 19-year-old who serves on the board of the Texas Young Republicans, also told USA TODAY he doesn't have an ideal candidate in mind
 But he wants someone who is young, energetic and shares his values
 Candidates who best represent that description include Florida Gov
 Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Virginia Gov
 Glenn Youngkin and others, he said
“With DeSantis, his record sort of speaks for itself in Florida," Anderson said
 "He's got a lot of things he's done there with the economy and with COVID policy
”He also pointed to DeSantis’ efforts in passing laws on what can be taught in classrooms and extending parental oversight of children’s education
Annika Krovi, a 16-year-old national chairwoman of the High School Democrats of America, told USA TODAY that her ideal candidate would be one that makes an active effort to work with younger voters to address issues such as gun violence prevention, climate and environmental justice and increased higher education accessibility
 “As a young brown woman, I'm also looking forward to supporting a candidate that is willing to protect reproductive rights and fight for racial equality,” Krovi said
The problem isn't necessarily Biden and Trump themselves, Samara Klar, a professor at the school of government and public policy at the University of Arizona, told USA TODAY
 Researchers have been spotting a trend of voters saying they dislike prominent candidates for the past two electoral cycles
“We’re also seeing a rising percentage of Americans upwards of 25% say that they don't like either party generally…it’s not only these candidates that seem to be turning off voters, although they are, but it's also just the political parties in general,” Klar said
And it's common incumbent presidents to be less popular in the year before a reelection bid, Franklin said
 “Most, but not all, see some rise in their job approval during the reelection campaign year,” Franklin said
 “Part of that is simply that governing usually includes disappointments while campaigning allows the incumbent to stress their virtues and successes, reminding voters why they won last time
”For Biden, one of voters’ biggest concerns appears to center around age
 Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, previously argued that, even if Biden's age has not affected his ability to do the job, "some members of the public may nonetheless believe he is not mentally sharp enough or that he lacks the necessary physical stamina
”Voters also have concerns around Biden's handling of inflation, which could worsen if the United Auto Workers' strike is lengthy, and a looming government shutdown that could affect interest rates, according to Michael Traugott, a political scientist at the University of Michigan
For Trump, one of his liabilities is his indictments in four criminal cases, according to David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center
 A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll from June found that 33% of sampled Republican and Independent voters said they would be less likely to vote for Trump due to his legal troubles
Republican voters will have another opportunity to kick the tires on the 2024 presidential candidates who take the stage Wednesday for the second GOP primary debate
Fewer White House hopefuls will debate this week than those who assembled for their first discussion in August, but it remains unclear how many will be on stage at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California
Six candidates have qualified for the second debate ahead of the Sept
 25 deadline, and Trump has again declined to participate
 The former president instead plans to visit Michigan to speak with striking auto workers
Trump remains the unquestionable frontrunner in the primary and besides pummeling attacks aimed at Florida Gov
 Ron DeSantis, he has largely ignored other contenders for the Republican nomination
 Polling out of New Hampshire, for instance, shows Trump holding a 26-point lead over his nearest competitor
That leaves the question of what, if anything, the other contenders must do to chip away at Trump's massive lead and gain traction with the GOP base
Here's a look at what is at stake for each of the candidates who have qualified for Wednesday's debate
DeSantis risks losing his title as Trump's chief rival in the contest after months of attacks and scrutiny have taken a toll
The CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released last week showed DeSantis plummeting by 13 percentage points among likely voters in the Granite State since July
 The drop took Florida's governor from second at 23% to fifth with 10% support
DeSantis, who gained notoriety in the conservative universe for being Florida's chief cultural warrior, noticeably didn't take lay a finger on Trump during the first debate
But while campaigning in Iowa recently, DeSantis said anti-abortion activists "should know that (Trump's) preparing to sell you out" after the former president called Florida's six-week ban on abortion a "terrible mistake" politically
 He later told a TV news station Trump "believes he's entitled" to the GOP nomination and isn't "doing the work it takes to really earn people's votes
"DeSantis can't afford to lose more ground, so many expect he will be more aggressive on stage this week
If anyone received an adrenaline rush out of the Aug
 23 debate in Milwaukee, it was former South Carolina Gov
 Nikki Haley who saw a boost in the polls
Haley has been trying to strike a more traditional tone for a Republican nominee, emphasizing fiscal policies such as cutting middle-class taxes as a way to soothe ongoing economic woes
During a speech in New Hampshire, where she is currently polling third, Haley said her former boss was "thin-skinned and easily distracted
"Haley has also leaned into her foreign policy background as the former UN ambassador under Trump, saying he was strong at first on international affairs but has become "weak in the knees" in terms of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia
Where Haley is likely to distinguish herself the most on Wednesday is by emphasizing surveys showing that she is the best Republican to defeat President Joe Biden in a hypothetical general election
 She has also recently made Vice President Kamala Harris a foil in her interviews, saying that is her real opponent
Vivek Ramaswamy's campaign has been a quest to "out-Trump" Trump, which got him to the center of the debate stage in August
That also came with inheriting a brighter spotlight from opponents, who slammed him as inexperienced, and reporters, who have taken a closer look at his "revolutionary" ideas and life story
In the weeks since the first debate the 38-year-old biotech millionaire has stayed in the news for various reasons: flip-flopping on joining TikTok as a way to appeal to younger voters; comparing Rep
 Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass
, a Black woman, to the Ku Klux Klan; and defending his past use of a temporary visa program for high-skilled foreign workers, despite his calls to dismantle the system
 The question is if Ramaswamy will be a momentary flavor of voters seeking a Trump alternative while asking why they should chose a diet version of the former president
Perhaps picking up on that question, Ramaswamy said at a campaign event in Ohio last week how his "friend" Trump misled Republicans when he promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act
"Eight years later, did it happen? No, it did not," Ramaswamy said
 "It is a false promise if it is contingent on Congress
"Mike Pence has one of the most difficult tightropes to walk in the 2024 primary
 He is Trump's former vice president who says he is proud of their record while finding ways to finds contrasts with the man who put him on 2016 ticket
As of late that has been Pence, a former congressman and governor, has been calling out Trump's populist style, saying it hurts Republicans in the long-run and isn't compatible with conservatism
 He stressed how Trumpism—and by extension the MAGA movement—is more about "personal grievances and performative outrage" than traditional conservative principles at a recent speech in New Hampshire
"The truth is, Donald Trump, along with his imitators, often sound like an echo of the progressives they would replace," Pence said
The question coming into Wednesday is can Pence convince a significant portion of Republicans that being the traditional GOP standard bearer can effectively win a primary
Sen
 Tim Scott's nice guy approach resulted in him being largely forgotten during the first GOP debate in August, where he spoke for about eight minutes during the two-hour event
One area where he could find more room to breathe is the differences among Republicans on abortion access
 Scott is a staunch social conservative, and has said in recent interviews how Trump is "wrong" on abortion, and that the country needs a "pro-life president in the future
"Scott, much like Pence, will have to make a case for why supporting a 15-week national abortion ban is a political winner at a time when progressives are winning statewide referendums
The South Carolina lawmaker may also find time to carve out his position on striking auto workers after jousting with UAW President Shawn Fain, who filed an unfair labor practice claim against Scott for suggesting striking workers should be fired
"They want to threaten me and shut me up," Scott said
 "They don’t scare me
"Chris Christie remains the most outspoken Republican in terms of focusing almost exclusively on warning primary voters that Trump's four criminal trials will be a fatal flaw in 2024
The former New Jersey is also calling Trump a chicken for once again bypassing a debate
"If I was him, I wouldn't want to show up to the debate either," Christie said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, citing the Trump administration's failure to build a wall at the U
S
-Mexico border, balance the budget or repeal the Affordable Care Act
But Christie faces a popularity issue himself that he will have to overcome, as polling shows just 17% of New Hampshire Republicans have a favorable view of him, according to the CNN/University of New Hampshire poll
 Even worse is that 60% of likely GOP primary voters in the survey said they wouldn't support Christie under any circumstance
Parents spend a lot of time worrying about how they’ll afford college tuition for their kids someday, but a pair of recent surveys show exorbitant college-like costs actually come much earlier in life
 In more than half the states, childcare costs more than in-state public college tuition, according to lending platform NetCredit
com
 Then, comes the price you pay for independent kids
 Teen car ownership now also costs more than in-state tuition at a public university, an analysis by car app Jerry shows
 Everyone already knows raising a child is expensive, but it’s getting even pricier
 After two years of elevated inflation, families are feeling pinched more than ever
 Overall, for example, parents spend a significant portion of their annual income on child-related expenses
 Nationwide, families spend 19% of their annual income on child-rearing expenses, online lending marketplace LendingTree said
 “Ideally, you’d be able to keep childcare costs to 10% or less of your total income,” said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst
 “But that’s laughably unrealistic for millions of Americans
” On average, childcare costs $1,031 a year more than public college tuition, NetCredit said
 Lower your auto insurance costs: Find the best car insurance of 2023NetCredit examined the average annual fees paid for public in-state college tuition and the average cost of childcare in each state and calculated the difference between the two
 Then, it compared these costs to local average salaries to find the affordability of childcare and in-state college tuition in every state
 In 28 out of 50 states, childcare tops in-state tuition, it said
 Hawaii has the largest gap: Annual childcare costs a whopping $15,995 more than a year of tuition
 New York is a close second with a $15, 951 gap between childcare and college costs
 At the other end of the spectrum, Vermont’s annual childcare costs were $5,423 less than in-state public college tuition, NetCredit said
 That’s followed by South Carolina, a distant second, with childcare $3,679 below annual tuition
  It costs $11,378 a year for a teen to own and drive a new car, more than the average annual in-state tuition at a four-year public university, estimated at $10,940, Jerry said
 To find this, Jerry used AAA’s driving costs calculator and added the difference ($829) in insurance costs between teen drivers and those over 19 years old
 It set annual mileage at 10,000, the choice closest to the 7,200 miles a year driven by the average teen, according to the U
S
 Federal Highway Administration
  When comparing increases in tuition and the costs of car ownership, it compared the College Board’s tuition in the 2017-18 academic year with the 2022-23 school year, and car ownership costs from the end of 2018 through July 2023
   Not every teen gets new wheels, of course, but even owning a used car can add up
 The annual $10,276 cost to own a 5-year-old Toyota Camry exceeds in-state tuition at the flagship public university in 13 states and is just $664 less than the average for all four-year public universities, Jerry said
 At $14
08 per hour - the average wage for fast food workers, lifeguards, retail salespeople, and amusement and recreation attendants - a teen would have to work 49 hours a week over a 15-week summer, or 14 hours every week for a year, to cover the cost of owning and driving a 2018 Toyota, assuming it’s financed, Jerry said
 “No wonder some studies have concluded that shifting economics explains much of the difference in attitudes toward driving and car ownership among Millennials and Gen Z,” wrote Jerry’s Henry Hoenig
 Demand for childcare has risen in the past couple of decades in line with the number of two-income households, according to the St
 Louis Federal Reserve
  In 2019, the public policy nonprofit Center for American Progress said about half of U
S
 children spend at least some time in a licensed childcare facility
 Pair that with the pandemic, which fueled sudden wage growth for childcare workers as centers worked to attract and retain workers much like other businesses
 As of October 2021, average hourly earnings for childcare workers had risen 10
4% to $16
44 from the prior year —on top of already above-average wage growth of 4
3% between September 2019 and September 2020, and much stronger than the 5
8% wage growth for other workers, it said
 In July, annual childcare costs were up 6% from a year earlier, around twice the pace of overall inflation of 3
2%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said

   Americans' paychecks just aren't keeping up
Although workers’ annual pay increases have outpaced inflation since May, their spending power has shrunk over the past two years as inflation drove up overall prices by roughly 12%
 Essentials like groceries and utilities have jumped even higher
With high costs eroding millions of household budgets, unions like the United Auto Workers are now starting to push employers to reinstate a once common but now rarer mechanism for ensuring that wages keep up with inflation
COLA, or cost-of-living adjustments to paychecks, are well-known by Social Security recipients, millions of whom live on a fixed income and carefully track the yearly, inflation-adjusted tweaks to their benefits
 But for anyone else, the pay bumps that were baked into many union contracts for decades have fallen away over the last half-century
 The government has even stopped tracking data on them
But COLA is returning to the national conversation
 The striking UAW, in its tense negotiations with automakers, has said it will not accept a contract agreement without a COLA, an unnamed source familiar with the contract talks told the Detroit Free Press, which is part of the USA TODAY network
"(We've seen) very high inflation
 Workers are feeling that pain and they're saying, 'We want to be protected,'” said Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations in New Jersey
COLA provisions used to be common among union contracts, with 61% including them in 1976, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
 Twenty years later, the percentage had dropped to about one-third of that peak level
The 61% included UAW contracts with the Detroit Three automakers (General Motors, Ford and Stellantis – formerly Chrysler), which adopted the wage adjustments in 1948 and 1950
 The provisions followed a spike in inflation, with overall consumer prices up nearly 20% from the year prior in March 1947
 Inflation spiked once again ahead of COLA’s peak in the mid-1970s, with overall consumer prices growing 11
8% year-over-year in January 1975
  The prominence of unions in the 1970s and '80s also helped COLA numbers
 Data from the BLS shows that 20% of American workers were union members in 1983 ‒ the first year for which comparable data are available ‒ versus 10% in 2022
 "When unions were stronger, they were able to fight for COLAs and win them," Givan said
But as union power waned and inflation eased, so did COLA coverage
 By 1995, 22% of union contracts had the provisions, according to BLS data
 The benefit was suspended in UAW contracts with the Detroit Three in 2009 after the automakers faced bankruptcy during the 2008 financial crisis
 While the companies' finances have since bounced back, the COLA clauses have not
 The latest ratified contracts from 2019 show that COLA language was removed from Ford and Chrysler agreements and remains suspended in the GM contract
It’s unclear how many union contracts include COLAs today; BLS stopped collecting data on it after 1995 because of funding restrictions, according to the agency
Experts say they have no reason to believe the cost-of-living adjustments have picked up substantially since then
"I don't have any evidence that it was rebounding before the pandemic," said Harry Katz, a professor of collective bargaining at Cornell University
 COLA clauses were meant to help workers and employers deal with the uncertainty of multi-year contracts
 Instead of both sides trying to predict future inflation rates during wage negotiations, COLA provisions helped them account for any unforeseen consumer price hikes
While data on the prevalence of cost-of-living adjustments today are slim, Katz noted that they don’t make much sense in non-union jobs without multi-year contracts
“I don’t know of an instance where a non-union workforce has a COLA,” he said
 “You’re setting pay annually and you don’t have uncertainty with inflation
 You don’t need a mechanism for that
”Non-union jobs typically do not have guaranteed raises
 Instead, pay increases tend to vary by industry, company, location and job performance
 Eighty percent of organizations surveyed by compensation research and software firm Payscale in late 2022 said they planned to provide base pay increases this year, with 56% planning to give bumps of more than 3%
But data show that U
S
 wages have struggled to keep up with inflation over the past two years
 While average U
S
 wage growth finally began outpacing price increases in May, many Americans say they still haven’t caught up to the big run-up in prices
US wage growth is finally outpacinginflation
 Many Americans aren't feeling it
If the UAW secures a COLA provision in its contract negotiations, that could help “set a new standard” for other union contracts, according to Givan of Rutgers
 “Other workers will also fight for a cost-of-living increase,” she said
 While there’s no good data that shows the current state of COLA provisions, a number of unions have started demanding cost-of-living adjustments in recent months
 Canada’s British Columbia General Employees’ Union and Hospital Employees’ Union, for instance, both secured deals last year that include COLA clauses
  Whether more contracts will include COLA depends on inflation levels and union power, according to Cedric de Leon, a professor of sociology and labor studies at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst
If high inflation continues, “then I would bet that the labor movement continues to explore this sort of older COLA mechanism for addressing that,” he said, adding that an increase in union participation would also make future COLA provisions more likely
 But if inflation continues to ease, then contract negotiators may not prioritize COLA and instead focus on giving employees an overall pay increase
“The thing is that we're living through history,” de Leon said
 “We don’t actually know (what to expect)
 So it's just up in the air
”In February, Kia and Hyundai promised new anti-theft software upgrades would help hit the brakes on a dramatic rise in car thefts across the country, fixing a security flaw that made certain models of the two car brands easy to steal
Months later, nearly 80% of the roughly 8
3 million impacted Kias and Hyundais still lack the upgrades, the two companies confirmed
Climate-fueled disasters like Hurricane Ian are wreaking havoc on home values across the nation, but Florida’s messy insurance market makes it one of the most stressed, new research out of a nonprofit climate modeling group indicates
High insurance premiums and a state-backed requirement that homeowners covered by the state-backed insurer of last resort enroll in the National Flood Insurance Program over the next three years could drop home values up to 40% in Florida in the next 30 years, data provided by First Street Foundation shows
 And climate and insurance experts say that may further gentrify Florida’s coastal regions and barrier islands
Lower your auto insurance costs: Find the best car insurance of 2023While the carbonated soda industry has long been booming, bringing in annual revenue to the tune of $328 billion according to Statista, a growing segment within that market is now valued at more than $32 billion − and is projected to reach $93 billion by 2030
 That rapidly expanding market has been built around seltzer water − a product touted by celebrities and influencers alike
 Despite its growing popularity, seltzer water has some known disadvantages and plenty of advantages that consumers might want to be aware of
Seltzer water, also called sparking water, carbonated water or bubbly water, "is created when carbon dioxide bubbles are added to still water," says Jamie Bering, MD, a gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic in Arizona
 Indeed, it's the injection of that carbon dioxide gas under pressure "that causes the bubbles and fizzy quality of seltzer water," explain Jen Messer, a nutrition consultant and registered dietitian at Jen Messer Nutrition
Popular seltzer water brands include La Croix, Perrier and S
 Pellegrino
 Some people also use sparkling water machines such as SodaStream to make their own carbonated water at home
 Though seltzer water is just as hydrating as regular water, it does have some advantages and disadvantages different than drinking tap water alone
 Messer says that sparking water can be "more interesting, appealing and enjoyable than plain water" especially so because it often comes in "a wide variety of flavors
" What's more, she says such flavors don't usually require the use of artificial sweeteners, "which makes seltzer water a good choice for those looking to reduce their calorie intake or avoid added sugars
" In this way, sparking water can also be a great way to transition away from soda
 "Seltzer water can be used as a healthier alternative to drinking soda," says Bering
Indeed, a single can of Coca-Cola contains 39 grams of sugar, 14 grams more than the 25 grams of added sugar the American Heart Association recommends women to consume in an entire day and 3 grams more than the 36 grams of sugar it recommends men to stick to daily
 Frequent consumption of soda has been linked to obesity, Type 2 diabetes, nutritional deficiencies and an increased risk of heart disease
What is unhealthy about Diet Coke?And is regular Coca-Cola actually better for you?Lisa Young, PhD, RDN, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University and author of "Finally Full, Finally Slim," says that some people who drink the bubbly liquid "have also found that drinking seltzer water can also provide temporary relief from indigestion
" But seltzer water has some disadvantages as well
 For instance, Messer agrees that many people have reported that seltzer water can help with indigestion, but "interestingly, other individuals have found that seltzer water actually causes gastrointestinal discomfort such as bloating or gas
" It can make one's acid reflux worse as well
 And Messer says the liquid isn't great for anyone trying to reduce sodium in their diets
 "Your favorite can of seltzer water may have 100 or 200 milligrams of sodium, which doesn’t seem like much, but it can really add up," she says
 That's especially worth keeping in mind for people watching their blood pressure
 Young says that because seltzer water is also acidic, "high consumption may affect the enamel on teeth over time
" In fact, not only can such acidity cause tooth decay, but people who drink a lot of seltzer water may also not be getting as much decay-preventing fluoride as people who drink tap water since fluoride is added to most supplies of drinking water in America
Because of the carbonation in seltzer water, many of the same things happen in one's stomach when it's consumed as happens when drinking soda or other carbonated beverages
 When carbonation enters the stomach, our body warms it, and the carbon dioxide gas gets released and expands, which eventually has to come out somewhere − usually through flatulence or burping
 Many people prefer that side effect over the taste of drinking regular water alone, however, and all the experts agree that seltzer water is preferred over drinking traditional soft drinks
 "It's important to note that seltzer water can vary just as people do and some individuals may experience a range of advantages or disadvantages based on their individual health, preferences and consumption habits," explains Messer
 "As with any food or beverage, moderation is key, and it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional if you have specific health concerns
" Left with a sour taste in your mouth after looking at that tattoo you thought would be “sooo meaningful forever”? Cringing at a matching tattoo you got with someone you’re no longer close to? You’re not alone
A recent Pew Research Study found that 24% of Americans regret getting one or more of their tattoos
 If you’re looking for a fresh start, here’s the information you need about how to lift your ink including cost and time
Tattoo removal can cost anywhere from $500 to $2,000 per session, says Dr
 Bruce Katz, a board-certified dermatologist and the director of the JUVA Skin and Laser Center in New York City
 The price depends on several factors, including the type of laser used and the size and color of the tattoo
 The longer the tattoo takes to remove, the more expensive it will be
When you get a tattoo, the ink molecules are too big for your lymphatic system to drain, Katz says
 Tattoo removal lasers cause an acoustic reaction, meaning the laser energy is absorbed by the ink and causes it to explode into small particles
 The lymphatic system can then take them away
After several sessions, you’ll be left with a scab that you should treat just like you did when you got the tattoo – wash it with soapy water and apply an ointment like Aquaphor or Vaseline for a few days, Katz advises
“The laser energy has to go through the epidermis, the outer surface, in order to get down to the dermis,” Katz says
 “So it causes a disruption of the epidermis and that’s why people get a scab after the treatment
”The number of sessions you’ll need to fully remove a tattoo depends on the laser the office uses
 According to Katz, the two most commonly used lasers are: Q-switched Nd: Yag lasers, which remove the tattoo without scarring but take between 10-15 treatments, and picosecond lasers, newer machines that work in just five to seven treatments
“The length of time that the laser beam is hitting the skin is much shorter, so it can actually break up the tattoo particles into much smaller pieces than the Q-switched lasers,” Katz says of Picosecond lasers
The color of your tattoo also makes a difference
 You’ll want to find a tattoo removal service that specializes in your color
“To remove these tattoos adequately, you need the right wavelength laser to address those specific colors,” Katz says
 “If people go to certain offices that don’t have the right number of lasers, they’re going to take a lot longer to treat these tattoos and really not be able to completely remove them because some of the colors are not gonna respond

The school year is in full swing, and while you may have had ambitions to pack healthier lunches for you or your kids this season, life is busy and expensive
 Many schools are raising the cost of meals for kids this fall
 The USDA wants schools to serve healthier meals, which would come at a higher sticker price for schools and families, leaving communities to balance meeting nutritional standards and budget constraints
When it comes to health for both kids and adults, here’s your guide to what makes a lunch balanced
The most nutritious lunch follows the tried-and-true MyPlate guidelines, according to Caroline West Passerrello, registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics
 The MyPlate breakdown is based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and suggests roughly half of your plate be fruits and vegetables and grains and proteins on the other half
 Dairy, like milk, yogurt and cheese, is also recommended with your meal
Whether you’re a student or an adult, variety on your plate will ensure you have the energy and sustenance to continue throughout your day, West Passerrello says
 Here’s the method she uses with her elementary schooler: “I pull out a couple of fruits, a couple of grains, a couple of proteins and I just let her pick, she knows she has to pick one from each category,” she says
 “It doesn’t have to be this elaborate sandwich or salad or big meal – it can be four separate things that you just like putting together
”But even more basic than this, West Passrello says the healthiest lunch is “the one that’s eaten
” You know what we’re talking about – the ambitious meal you planned to make before the afternoon slipped away, the turkey sandwich that sat unrefrigerated for a little too long, the new food that didn’t appeal to your taste buds
 Several studies show students with access to free or reduced healthy lunch programs score better on tests than those without
 And even for adults, making time to eat lunch can help manage blood sugar levels and maintain satiety, mood and sleep quality, CNN reports
If you’ve prepared the lunch but forgot to eat it, there’s also the issue of food waste
 About 30-40% of the food supply in the U
S
 is wasted, according to the U
S
 Department of Agriculture
 Food waste contributes to 170 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions, which still excludes the methane emissions from food waste rotting in landfills, the EPA reports
 Some of this occurs at the production and supply chain stages, but it also happens at home
 So when you're preparing lunch, ask yourself these two questions: Is this something I want and like to eat? Will this be safe in my lunch box?“You don’t want to pack something for yourself or your kiddos that’s something they’ve never seen before because that’s probably going to lead to more food waste,” West Passerrello says
 You also need to keep food safety in mind, particularly if your lunch involves meat or dairy products, to avoid food poisoning or exposure to other bacteria
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bacteria can rapidly multiply in food left at room temperature or in the “danger zone” of 40-140 degrees
 You should never leave perishable food out for more than two hours or one hour in temperatures exceeding 90 degrees
“Make sure you either put an ice pack in with it or you’re able to keep it in a refrigerator,” West Passerrello says, adding that a frozen yogurt cup or water bottle can double as an ice pack as it thaws through the day
You can also opt for a shelf-stable lunch like a classic PB&J and dried fruits or vegetables – anything you can keep in your pantry safely without refrigerating
“If it’s just that it’s going to sit in somebody’s locker, you could still do something like cherry tomatoes or baby carrots,” West Passerrello says
 “But if it’s going to sit out in the sun then you’ve got to really be careful with what you pick
”Is intermittent fasting healthy?:It can be, but 'it's not a magic solution'You know eating lunch is important, but how do you make it a priority? West Passerrello says the routine aspect is key: Make it a habit by packing your lunch the evening before or whenever suits your schedule
 If you alternate hybrid and remote work, try making two lunches in one go – one to eat now at home and the other to store in the fridge for tomorrow’s office day
 West Passerrello also recommends setting reminders to eat, like a sticky note on your computer
“A lot of times people working from home also skip lunch even though there’s a whole kitchen and refrigerator right there,” she says
 You don’t have to pack a complicated, Instagram-worthy meal to get in your nutrients at lunchtime
 Work your way through MyPlate’s four plate categories: fruit, vegetables, protein and grains and add some dairy on the side
For protein and grains, you could go with the classic peanut butter (or sun butter) and jelly or another deli meat sandwich – bonus points if you can sneak in veggies
 If you’re sick of sandwiches, try cheese and crackers, make a deli charcuterie (grown-up Lunchables, anyone?), or make an on-the-go pepperoni pizza
 Check out the recipe for that lunch idea and more here
 Or you could go with West Passerrello’s favorite, salad jars, which encompass all of the MyPlate elements in one meal-prepped container
For the fruit and vegetable portion, a few of your favorite pieces from the produce drawer will do
 If you aren’t able to refrigerate them, West Passerrello recommends dried fruit or veggies, shelf-stable fruit cups or veggie straws or chips, as long as they’re made of vegetables

 Get a load of what the week ahead looks like for the Republican Party: First, a floundering group of Republican presidential primary candidates, none polling higher than 14%, will attend a debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Southern California
 Absent from Wednesday's debate will be the guy who’s beating the tuna salad out of them all, a one-term, twice-impeached former president facing 91 state and federal felony counts ranging from falsifying business records to conspiracy to defraud the U
S
 government
That criminal defendant, Donald Trump, rather than debating a pack of also-rans, will be in Detroit meeting with striking United Auto Workers union members and, one assumes, pretending he’s pro-union when his actions in office were anything but
 He loaded the National Labor Relations Board with anti-union people, leading to restrictions on workers’ rights to organize on employer property and making it easier for companies to get rid of unions
UAW President Shawn Fain responded to news of Trump's visit by saying: "Every fiber of our union is being poured into fighting the billionaire class and an economy that enriches people like Donald Trump at the expense of workers
"So that should be a day of spectacular dumbness
On Thursday, House Republicans will ignore a looming government shutdown and hold their first impeachment inquiry hearing against President Joe Biden
 They want to impeach the president for … things? Nobody is quite sure because, despite months of investigations, Republican lawmakers have failed to show the American people a single piece of evidence that would suggest Biden is impeachment-worthy
 His son, Hunter Biden, might be impeachment-worthy, but, inconveniently, he’s not president
Conspiracy world:GOP's Hunter Biden hysteria makes even less sense after plea deal gets put on holdThe hearing will be a big tent shy of a circus, and one can expect the post-hearing blabbering from VCRs (very concerned Republicans) to include Olympic-size leaps to conclusions and enough random-dot connecting to wipe out a phalanx of fact-checkers
Don’t worry, things will get dumber yet
Government shutdown isn't inevitable
It's a choice – a dumb one
The deadline for Congress to pass a government funding bill is Saturday night, and Republican lawmakers in the House are preoccupied with infighting led by hardcore MAGA folks eager to watch the world burn
 With little progress made over the weekend, there’s a good chance Republicans will stubborn their way to a government shutdown by week’s end
GOP actually work?House Republicans as government shutdown nears: Nobody told us we'd have to governCheering for that conclusion, of course, is Trump, who wants to take a principled stand on fiscal responsibility
HAH! I made that last part up
 Trump wouldn’t know a principle if it paddled him with a rolled up Forbes magazine
 He wants the government to shut down because he thinks – incorrectly – it would halt the various legal cases he’s facing
You know, the legal cases all his presidential primary opponents refuse to highlight as the key reasons he should not be the GOP's nominee?Collectively, that is a veritable tsunami of stupidity so overwhelming it deserves a recap:A bunch of GOP presidential candidates who have no shot at the nomination because they only timidly criticize Trump out of fear of alienating his supporters will babble onstage at a library named after one of the Republican Party’s most-revered figures, Reagan, a man who would undoubtedly loathe most of them and would be particularly disgusted by Trump himself
While they’re doing that, Trump will lie to a select group of supportive auto workers who somehow see a rich lifetime con artist eyeball deep in legal trouble as a sensible choice for commander in chief
The next day, Trump’s lackeys in Congress will embarrass themselves by spewing a vivid collection of conspiracy theories and innuendos that allege Biden is both a global criminal mastermind and a doddering old fool who should be hauled off to Guantanamo while we wait on evidence to prove whatever it is this collection of right-wing sycophants are alleging
And then, almost certainly, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his out-of-control caucus will find a way to marry their dislike for governing with their inestimable skill at doing exactly the wrong thing and cause a wholly avoidable government shutdown
While all this is happening, most Americans will be living their lives and worrying about things that matter, like jobs and health care and education and the cost of food and whatnot
Democrats have actually been doing things to address those concerns, from the Inflation Reduction Act to Biden’s infrastructure bill, and while Republicans are having their week of living ludicrously, Biden – an actual pro-union president – will meet striking workers on the picket line
 So a reasonable question to ask as this week unfolds is: Which side is making sense here? Which side has at least one foot, or maybe even both, in reality, and which side is flailing nonsensically in service to a loudmouth whose only concern is himself?We’ll see
 Maybe the Republicans will surprise us
HAH! I made that last part up as well
 This week will be shambolic
 And for anyone paying attention, that should matter

com/RexIsAJerkIn February 2019, Sen
 Bob Menendez was having nightmares
 The Democratic senator from New Jersey said he was haunted by a question that "keeps me up at night" − whether President Donald Trump was compromised by the Russian government because of past secret dealings
Menendez's restless nights also may have had something to do with the fact that at the time, he was allegedly accepting lavish gifts from various sources in exchange for using his Senate seat to bestow favors
The indictment of Menendez and his wife last week included details of alleged bribes that went to the senator in exchange for revealing sensitive, nonpublic information to Egyptian contacts less than a year before his sleep-deprived speech
Menendez denied the accusations on Friday
 However, even if half of this indictment is true, Menendez is toast
 He was able to dodge a bullet in 2017 when a jury hung over a separate series of corruption charges involving lavish gifts
 This time, the Justice Department says it has photos of thousands of dollars in cash stuffed in clothing, a luxury car, gold bars and other gifts
 That would keep anyone up at night, but there may be one other insomniac this week: Hunter Biden's lawyer Abbe Lowell
The Menendez indictment likely proved chilling reading for Lowell, who not only represents President Joe Biden's son but also represented Menendez in his prior bribery trial
There are striking similarities between the Menendez and Biden cases
While Hunter Biden was allegedly selling access to and influence with his father, he also allegedly received massive payments
 His associate Devon Archer told Congress that they were selling the Biden family "brand," and that Joe Biden was "the brand
"Don't tell me how to do my job:Biden scolds media on how to cover his impeachment inquiry
 What a bunch of bull jerky
Like Menendez, Hunter Biden allegedly received a luxury car from his foreign clients
 For the senator, the Justice Department says it was a $60,000 Mercedes-Benz
 For the president's son, investigators say it was a $142,000 Fisker sports car
Menendez allegedly received gold bars worth up to $120,000
 Biden received a diamond allegedly worth $80,000
Indeed, the alleged object of these payments was influence with then-Vice President Biden, when he was the presiding officer of the Senate
 Menendez was one of the nation's most powerful senators at the time
There are also dealings that reference Hunter Biden and his associates in the Menendez matter
 When the senator was trying to arrange for Joe Biden to host a foreign event, an aide to Menendez reportedly reached out to Hunter Biden's associates
While the president's son is accused of peddling influence, in Menendez's case, it is his wife who is accused of acting as a go-between with those trying to buy the senator's attention
 Nadine Menendez allegedly had lunches and countless communications with people, who, according to the indictment, sought favors from the senator
Nadine Menendez allegedly knew the co-defendants before she married the senator in 2020
 The couple met at an IHOP, but he fittingly proposed to her in 2019 at the Taj Mahal on a trip to India
 The setting for the proposal would foretell the lavish gifts to come
Like Hunter, Nadine started an international consulting company, Strategic International Business Consultants, after being unemployed before meeting the senator
 She found ample business
Like Hunter, she is accused of marketing her ability to deliver access to her husband
 In March 2020, she allegedly texted an Egyptian official that “anytime you need anything you have my number and we will make everything happen
”Left's incessant prosecution of Trump:In Democrats' quest to prosecute former president, progressives ignore free speech rightsThere is of course a major difference between the Biden and Menendez cases: Menendez and his wife are being criminally charged for their alleged influence peddling
The Justice Department has not only let the statute of limitations run out on the most serious tax charges against Hunter Biden, but it also has not charged the president's son under the Foreign Agents Registration Act
Despite charging figures like Paul Manafort for similar accusations, prosecutors have avoided charges in the Biden case that would put Hunter at the center of a corruption prosecution
 Instead, they sought an embarrassing "sweetheart deal" that collapsed in court
In the Menendez case, investigators left no stone unturned in tracing gifts and money
 In the Biden case, a special agent with the IRS testified before Congress that the Bidens were tipped off on planned searches and an attempt to interview the president's son
As the Justice Department grinds Menendez into a fine powder, it is likely to draw more attention to the relatively light touch shown Hunter Biden
 It is, as Menendez said on the Senate floor in 2019, the type of thing that keeps you up at night
Jonathan Turley, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is the Shapiro professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University
 Follow him on X, formerly Twitter: @JonathanTurleyWith recent setbacks in negotiations and the deadline quickly approaching, emerging consensus among lawmakers, staff, the Capitol Hill news media and longtime Washington operatives is that the federal government is almost certainly heading for another government shutdown come Oct
 1, the beginning of the government’s fiscal year
 A government shutdown isn’t inevitable – it is a choice
 And it is among the dumbest decisions Washington can make
Since 1995, there have been five government shutdowns, instigated by both Republicans and Democrats on the theory that withholding support for keeping the government open and functioning could somehow provide leverage to force the other party to agree to certain demands
These demands have ranged from changes to the federal deficit to defunding Obamacare and ratifying Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to building the border wall
The five government shutdowns have one thing in common: They all failed
When will Congress act?Government shutdown talks return as US debt reaches $33 trillion
If government shutdowns were just another failed legislative tactic that policymakers tried from time to time, no one would care much
 But this tactic has real-world negative consequences that hurt the American people, businesses of all sizes and the American economy
During a shutdown, mortgage and loan applications are delayed because lenders can’t access income records or Social Security number verification services
 Visas and passports are delayed, hurting both American travelers and the American tourism industry
The inability to get government permits can slow down everything from energy production to commercial fishing – even the export of American-made goods
 During the last government shutdown that lasted for 35 days and ended in January 2019, the Small Business Administration was unable to approve loans, creating a massive backlog that led to financial insecurity for hundreds of small business owners
Major federal contractors servicing critical agencies such as NASA and the Department of the Interior became insolvent and had to fire employees – threatening economic livelihoods and our national security
 And that barely scratches the surface of the fallout
 During the 35 days the government was shuttered, the U
S
 Chamber of Commerce heard from people across the country about the hardships the shutdown was creating and how their lives and livelihoods were being upended:The reality is, a government shutdown can be more than just a chokepoint for a business’ operations; it can be a death knell to their very existence and a blow to the livelihoods that depend on it
 Are Republicans dishonest?Democrats immoral? Why toxic polarization threatens democracy
To be clear, there are problems that Congress and the Biden administration are long overdue in addressing, including the border crisis and a runaway debt deficit
 But history shows that a shutdown won’t help solve any of these issues
 It is only going to dig the hole deeper
  The good news: Shutting down the government is still a choice
Let’s hope that policymakers defy the emerging conventional wisdom, reject the notion that a shutdown is inevitable – and make the smart choice to keep the government open and American lives and livelihoods intact
As executive vice president, chief policy officer and head of strategic advocacy at the U
S
 Chamber of Commerce, Neil Bradley is responsible for the organization’s overall advocacy efforts
 In addition to managing policy development for the Chamber, Bradley oversees its government affairs activities, political program and relations with other business organizations
Mainstream and social media carry an extraordinary amount of influence on the public
 And that influence as it relates to the dehumanizing information shared about people who have been directly affected by the opioid and xylazine crises seems to be everywhere
The most recent article I saw was published Sept
 12 by the New York Post titled, "Shocking video shows zombie-like addicts at ‘ground zero’ of Philadelphia’s ‘tranq’ epidemic
" The article links to a TikTok video getting hundreds of thousands of views for filming individuals on the streets, many of whom seem unaware that they are even being filmed
 This content is severely harmful to humanity, especially those who are documented in these videos
Xylazine is a veterinary sedative that has been used to adulterate or “lace” synthetic opioids, such as illicitly manufactured fentanyl, and is being sold by itself and marketed on the street as “tranq
” One of the severe side effects of xylazine is that it causes a heavily sedative effect, leaving folks in an incoherent stupor
The media commonly refers to these individuals as “zombies
” Seriously, zombies?Dictionary
com defines a zombie as “an undead creature with a reanimated human body, typically depicted in science fiction or horror stories as contagious to the living by bite and vulnerable only to serious head trauma
”If that’s not a dehumanizing way to describe a human being suffering an active addiction, then please put me in my place
As a licensed clinical psychologist who has roots in the Kensington section of Philadelphia, accompanied by a long history of family members who struggle with addiction, this kind of news coverage is helping no one
 It’s not helping the person who is in active addiction; it’s not helping their family members, partners or spouses; and it sure isn’t helping to accurately educate the public on the disease of addiction
Addiction is a chronic-relapsing midbrain disease
 We have the scientific evidence supporting addiction as a disease
Getting sober saved my life
And helped me understand my identity as a transgender woman
The limbic system is an area of our brains that influences our motivations, behaviors and arousal
 Drugs like opioids, xylazine, stimulants (i
e
, cocaine, crystal meth), nicotine and alcohol overstimulate the limbic system, inciting a level of arousal or a high that causes the individual to have overbearing cravings or urges that lead to compulsive and often uncontrollable use
The overstimulation of the limbic system shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the area of your brain that lives behind the forehead and is responsible for making sound judgements and good decisions
 When an individual becomes addicted, the prefrontal cortex becomes downregulated
 Essentially, it malfunctions and leaves the individual with a drastically decreased capacity to make sound decisions
This has been researched with extensive brain imaging studies
This midbrain disease often has a behavioral presentation that manifests as someone with no moral compass
 Lying, cheating, manipulating, engaging in dangerous behaviors such as prostitution and retail theft, and neglecting themselves and those who depend on them, such as their children
This is the reality and costs of addiction, and it does not discriminate
 People in active addiction do and say things that are so far removed from the people we loved before they became addicted, and it hurts
It hurts the person in active addiction because they have lost control and have literally lost everything
 The party is over – they are no longer using “to party” or have fun, but to simply exist without feeling overbearingly sick with withdrawal
It also hurts the family and friends who love them
 They lose sleep worrying about their loved one in active addiction
 They ask themselves what they could have done better to prevent their partner, daughter, son, mom, dad, sister or brother from becoming addicted
Addiction is as much a family disease as it is a brain disease because it affects everyone in its orbit
I ask the social media “exploiters” and mainstream media reporters to imagine how they would feel if their or their loved ones’ photos and videos were plastered next to a headline that reads, “Shocking video shows zombie-like addicts at ‘ground zero’ of Philadelphia’s ‘tranq’ epidemic"? It hurts, doesn’t it?Drug decriminalization isn't working:Oregon voters chose a different approach toward drug decriminalization
 It was never going to work
Kensington might be "ground zero" for the xylazine epidemic, but most individuals who are addicted were born and raised in more desirable ZIP codes before addiction led them to Kensington
Residents born and raised in the neighborhood have also been impacted by the devastation of addiction that surrounds them
 But I guess the headline for such a story wouldn’t be exploitative enough to support the narrative that people who are addicted to synthetic opioids or xylazine are “zombie-like addicts
”Please do better
 Drop the clickbait headlines and these horrific descriptions
Focus on the systemic issues of addiction and the human being who is suffering underneath

”While the carbonated soda industry has long been booming, bringing in annual revenue to the tune of $328 billion according to Statista, a growing segment within that market is now valued at more than $32 billion − and is projected to reach $93 billion by 2030
 That rapidly expanding market has been built around seltzer water − a product touted by celebrities and influencers alike
 Despite its growing popularity, seltzer water has some known disadvantages and plenty of advantages that consumers might want to be aware of
Seltzer water, also called sparking water, carbonated water or bubbly water, "is created when carbon dioxide bubbles are added to still water," says Jamie Bering, MD, a gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic in Arizona
 Indeed, it's the injection of that carbon dioxide gas under pressure "that causes the bubbles and fizzy quality of seltzer water," explain Jen Messer, a nutrition consultant and registered dietitian at Jen Messer Nutrition
Popular seltzer water brands include La Croix, Perrier and S
 Pellegrino
 Some people also use sparkling water machines such as SodaStream to make their own carbonated water at home
 Though seltzer water is just as hydrating as regular water, it does have some advantages and disadvantages different than drinking tap water alone
 Messer says that sparking water can be "more interesting, appealing and enjoyable than plain water" especially so because it often comes in "a wide variety of flavors
" What's more, she says such flavors don't usually require the use of artificial sweeteners, "which makes seltzer water a good choice for those looking to reduce their calorie intake or avoid added sugars
" In this way, sparking water can also be a great way to transition away from soda
 "Seltzer water can be used as a healthier alternative to drinking soda," says Bering
Indeed, a single can of Coca-Cola contains 39 grams of sugar, 14 grams more than the 25 grams of added sugar the American Heart Association recommends women to consume in an entire day and 3 grams more than the 36 grams of sugar it recommends men to stick to daily
 Frequent consumption of soda has been linked to obesity, Type 2 diabetes, nutritional deficiencies and an increased risk of heart disease
What is unhealthy about Diet Coke?And is regular Coca-Cola actually better for you?Lisa Young, PhD, RDN, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University and author of "Finally Full, Finally Slim," says that some people who drink the bubbly liquid "have also found that drinking seltzer water can also provide temporary relief from indigestion
" But seltzer water has some disadvantages as well
 For instance, Messer agrees that many people have reported that seltzer water can help with indigestion, but "interestingly, other individuals have found that seltzer water actually causes gastrointestinal discomfort such as bloating or gas
" It can make one's acid reflux worse as well
 And Messer says the liquid isn't great for anyone trying to reduce sodium in their diets
 "Your favorite can of seltzer water may have 100 or 200 milligrams of sodium, which doesn’t seem like much, but it can really add up," she says
 That's especially worth keeping in mind for people watching their blood pressure
 Young says that because seltzer water is also acidic, "high consumption may affect the enamel on teeth over time
" In fact, not only can such acidity cause tooth decay, but people who drink a lot of seltzer water may also not be getting as much decay-preventing fluoride as people who drink tap water since fluoride is added to most supplies of drinking water in America
Because of the carbonation in seltzer water, many of the same things happen in one's stomach when it's consumed as happens when drinking soda or other carbonated beverages
 When carbonation enters the stomach, our body warms it, and the carbon dioxide gas gets released and expands, which eventually has to come out somewhere − usually through flatulence or burping
 Many people prefer that side effect over the taste of drinking regular water alone, however, and all the experts agree that seltzer water is preferred over drinking traditional soft drinks
 "It's important to note that seltzer water can vary just as people do and some individuals may experience a range of advantages or disadvantages based on their individual health, preferences and consumption habits," explains Messer
 "As with any food or beverage, moderation is key, and it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional if you have specific health concerns
" Though many people think of allergies as only being triggered in the fall or at springtime, the reality is that seasonal allergies often affect people year-round, including at winter
 Because some plants and trees don't go dormant during the winter in warmer climates, people exposed to such vegetation sometimes experience allergy symptoms during cold months
 More commonly, however, winter allergies flare up as a result of spending more time indoors when people are sealed up in their homes and are surrounded by allergens associated with dust, foods, pollutants brought into the home, other people, pet dander or even from rodents or insects seeking refuge from the cold
No matter which season contributes to one's allergies though, most people who struggle with them end up taking antihistamines to treat their symptoms
 When the body reacts to allergens such as pet dander or pollen, it's the result of a chemical called a histamine that's produced by one's immune system
 Some histamine is OK, but symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, congestion, watery eyes and itchy skin are the result of the body producing too much histamine when overreacting to something it views as a threat, even though most allergens actually aren't
 An antihistamine, then, is a medication used against histamine to treat or prevent common allergy symptoms
 "Antihistamines work by blocking how the body responds to histamine," explains Farheen Mirza, MD, allergy and immunology at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital
 Antihistamines are also commonly called anti-allergy or simply allergy medications
 There are both first- and second-generation antihistamines that are distinguished by when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved them
 There are also two different classifications or subtypes of antihistamines that have slightly different functions and target different symptoms or conditions
 Per Cleveland Clinic, the first subtype is called H-1 receptor antagonists or H-1 blockers, and the second subtype is called H-2 receptor antagonists or H-2 blockers
Antihistamines are available in many forms including nasal sprays, eyedrops, pills, liquids, creams, and, in more extreme cases, as inhalers or injections
 Some are available over-the-counter while others are available by prescription only
"Examples of FDA-approved antihistamines include loratadine (Claritin), fexofenadine (Allegra), cetirizine (Zyrtec), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), levocetirizine (Xyzal), and hydroxyzine (Vistaril)," says Matthew Rank, MD, a physician who works in the division of allergy, asthma and clinical immunology with Mayo Clinic in Arizona
Though the experts say that antihistamines are considered safe and are commonly recommended by doctors to treat allergy symptoms, allergy medications do have some common mild side effects
 These include drowsiness, headache, and drying out of one's nose, mouth or throat
 More rarely, antihistamines can also cause nausea, constipation, or a loss of appetite
 Serious but rare side effects include blurred vision, muscle weakness or trouble urinating
 Anyone who experiences serious side effects related to medication should consult with their physician right away
 For everyone else, antihistamines can bring much-needed relief from uncomfortable or debilitating allergy symptoms
 "Antihistamines are important because they are used to treat allergic symptoms such as hives, congestion, runny nose or sneezing," says Mirza
 Rank agrees, noting that the allergens that cause the release of histamine are everywhere and affect everyone differently, so having medicines to treat them is needful
 "Antihistamines were developed to help reduce and relieve allergy symptoms and they do that," he says
 'Wake-up call':Allergy medications may play a deadly role in the opioid epidemic, CDC study suggestsSophie Turner and Joe Jonas have reached a temporary decision over their daughters' residence a week after the "Game of Thrones" star sued the Jonas Brothers singer
Turner and Jonas share 3-year-old daughter, Willa, and a second daughter, who was born in July 2022 and whose name remains private
The former couple filed an interim consent order on Monday in the southern district of New York amid Turner's lawsuit against Jonas for the return of their children to England
In the consent order reviewed by USA TODAY, the parties agreed that they will not remove their daughters from "jurisdictions of the United States District Courts for the Southern & Eastern Districts of New York pending further order of this Court
" This includes all five boroughs in New York City, Long Island and counties up to Westchester
Turner and Jonas – who are in the midst of divorce – made the agreement "without prejudice," meaning they cannot use this decision against one another at their upcoming court date
A pretrial conference with regard to the actress' lawsuit is scheduled for Oct
 3, 2023
add outreach line hereThe "Game of Thrones" star claims in a lawsuit filed Thursday in the southern district of New York that she met with the Jonas Brothers singer on Sunday where they were "to discuss their separation," according to documents obtained by USA TODAY
Jonas disputed the claims via his rep Thursday, alleging a Florida court issued an order blocking either parent from relocating their children
 Jonas alleged that if he complies with Turner's request to let the children go to England, he "will be in violation" of the court order, a copy of which USA TODAY has obtained and reviewed
Turner alleged the children were supposed to be returned Wednesday, but said Jonas withheld their daughters' passports and "refuses to send the children home to England
" Jonas' rep Jeff Raymond said in a statement to USA TODAY that the couple "had a cordial meeting" in New York, "when Sophie came to New York to be with the kids
 They have been with her since that meeting
"Jonas filed for divorce against Turner in Miami-Dade County court on Sept
 5, according to court documents reviewed by USA TODAY
 In the petition, Jonas requested "shared parental responsibilities" between himself and Turner for their two daughters as well as enforcement of their April 2019 prenuptial agreement
The singer claimed the children have been living with Jonas in Miami "and other locations throughout the United States" in his petition, something the "Dark Phoenix" actress refutes in her filing
"The children have lived in England since April 10, 2023," Turner's filing states, adding that in December 2022 when they were in England for Christmas, she and Jonas confirmed they would make the country their "forever home
"Sophie Turner's lawsuit in detail:Actress sues for return of 2 children, ex Joe Jonas disputes claims amid divorce"All throughout their marriage, and particularly after their children were born, the parties often discussed their desire to raise their children in England and for their children to attend school in England," Turner's suit says, adding that the couple "regarded England as a safe location to raise their children
"Thursday's petition was filed under The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, both of which provide solutions for children internationally abducted from one parent
"When language like 'abduction' is used, it is misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst," Jonas' rep said in the statement Thursday
 "The children were not abducted
 After being in Joe's care for the past three months at the agreement of both parties, the children are currently with their mother
 Sophie is making this claim only to move the divorce proceedings to the UK and to remove the children from the U

 — A Vermont driver on Monday pleaded not guilty to a charge in the June crash that killed actor Treat Williams
Ryan Koss, 35, could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison if he's convicted of gross negligent operation with death resulting
An investigation of the June 12 crash in Dorset concluded a vehicle pulled in front of Williams, who was riding a motorcycle and was unable to avoid a collision, Vermont State Police said
Koss was turning left into a parking lot in an Honda SUV when he collided with Williams' oncoming motorcycle, police said
 Williams, 71, of Manchester Center, was pronounced dead at Albany Medical Center in New York
Richard Treat Williams' nearly 50-year career included starring roles in the TV series "Everwood" and the movie "Hair
" He appeared in more than 120 TV and film roles, including the movies "The Eagle Has Landed," "Prince of the City" and "Once Upon a Time in America
"Koss, the managing creative director of the Dorset Theatre Festival in Vermont, said he knew Williams for years as a member of the tight-knit community, as well as a fellow theater member, and considered him a friend
 He issued a statement in August saying he was devastated by Williams' death and offered his "sincerest condolences" to Williams' family, but he denied wrongdoing and said charges weren't warranted
Stars pay homage:Matt Bomer, more pay tribute to late co-star Treat Williams: 'So blessed to have known you'The 2023 New York Jets experienced a mechanical failure immediately after takeoff
 But there’s still time to land at their desired destination rather than circling back on the same tired flight plan
They just need to do one thing: Trade for quarterback Kirk Cousins – Sunday further illustrating it’s the most sensible move for the NYJ and Minnesota Vikings, Cousins’ employer since 2018
While Aaron Rodgers is recovering from Achilles surgery, the supposedly rehabilitated Zach Wilson is threatening to scuttle a third consecutive Jets season
 He led them to 39 yards in the first half of Sunday’s 15-10 loss to the New England Patriots, who have beaten their supposed AFC East rivals 15 times in a row and are 5-0 against Wilson
 He wound up with 157 yards passing for a constantly stalled offense and wasted another strong defensive showing from the Jets, something he did twice last year against New England
Head coach Robert Saleh continues to seek a positive spin but has little alternative
Right now
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more
"We're still early in the season," Saleh said
 "We knew, even with Aaron at quarterback, there was going to be some hiccups along the way because of a new offense, a new play caller, new O-line, just new players on the offensive side of the ball
“Now you’ve got this curveball that was sent to us, and so they’re acclimating
 They’re gonna get better, but it’s still very early in the season
”And Wilson?“Right now, Zach is the best (quarterback),” said Saleh, “he’s who gives us the best chance to win
”Right now – even Saleh making the qualifierHe can praise Wilson’s improved pocket presence, fundamentals and decision-making all he wants – there was nowhere to go but up in those areas
 What’s unchanged are the results, Wilson’s career record now 8-16
 And his talented supporting cast again appears frustrated with Wilson at the helm, this franchise looking ever more likely to waste another season of needed progression for its young core while Rodgers heals
Among qualified passers, Wilson's was the NFL's lowest rated in 2022 (72
8)
 This year? He's at 57
0
 Since his rookie year in 2021, his 69
2 QB rating, 54
9% completion rate and 17-22 TD-to-INT ratio are all worst in the NFL
 The league's least-efficient passing game prevented the Jets, who started 7-4 last year, from reaching postseason
So why not send Wilson, 24, and, say, two third-round picks – the Jets spent next year’s second-rounder on Rodgers – to the Vikings for Cousins, 35, who’s scheduled to be a free agent at season’s end? With Rodgers vowing to return better than ever, there’s no reason to believe the Jets will pick up Wilson’s fifth-year option next spring
 Yet there is reason to believe a quarterback of Cousins’ caliber – at least as it pertains to regular-season play – could reroute this entire organization in a positive direction culturally, if even as a substitute teacher
Cousins wouldn’t necessarily have to drive the bus for a team that’s (yet again) just seemingly a quarterback away – and you wouldn't expect him to immediately if he parachutes in
 Yet he surely could relatively soon given how well he’s generally played in 2023, “KFC” becoming the fifth player in league history with at least 325 passing yards and multiple TD passes in the first three games of a season
 He’s also got a big brain – yes, prone to occasional vapor lock on the field – but one that can synthesize a playbook quickly enough and a former Vikings teammate (running back Dalvin Cook) who could help with the onboarding process
 And pulling the Jets (1-2) out of what has all the appearances of another nosedive would be great free agency marketing for Cousins, who – no matter what you think of him as a player – has proven he's one of the greatest businessmen the league's ever seen
Isn’t that a much better alternative than Wilson – or Carson Wentz or Matt Ryan, free agents whom Fox Sports reported Sunday have reached out to the Jets (Ryan later denied interest) – for a squad that needs to learn how to win, not go 7-10, ahead of Rodgers’ expected return?As for the Vikings … right now?They’re 0-3 following Sunday’s crushing defeat to the Los Angeles Chargers, Minnesota consistently losing heartbreakers – all of its defeats by six points or fewer – after going 11-0 in one-score affairs in a charmed voyage to the NFC North throne in 2022
 Based on a sample size going back to the NFL’s last expansion in 2002, the probability the Vikings won’t reach the playoffs this season now stands at 99%
So why not deal Cousins, whom the team opted not to re-up contractually over the summer? He can’t be franchised, his restructured deal voiding after the 2024 deadline to tag players
 Besides, the Vikings have already been maneuvering out of veteran contracts (Cook, Adam Thielen, Eric Kendricks) to extend core players like Pro Bowl tight end T
J
 Hockenson, knowing full well they’ll almost certainly be backing up a Brinks truck for generational wideout Justin Jefferson next year
And with this season effectively over? You immediately get useful draft capital from the Jets rather than lose Cousins for nothing more than one eventual compensatory pick while giving Wilson a change of scenery, the best receiver in the league, a reliable tight end and a leader, Kevin O’Connell, who made his bones coaching up quarterbacks
 Maybe Wilson finally puts it together and morphs into the player he was projected to be as the No
 2 pick of the 2021 draft – a long-term win for the Vikings
 Maybe Wilson’s spiral continues, and he drags the Vikes to a 3-14 record – quite likely a long-term win for the Vikings if it puts them in position to draft 2022 Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Caleb Williams
J-E-T-S
 Skol
 For two franchises currently taking differing routes to a similar destination – mediocrity – this is a deal that could be a win-win course correction for both

WASHINGTON — Somehow, the Atlanta Braves have avoided becoming the subject of corporate white papers or fawning industry analyses on sustainability
 Yet their annual, unending, relentless success certainly begs many questions
Such as, does stability breed dominance? Or must a team establish a culture of winning before laying down roots?Not that it matters
Sunday, the Braves notched their 100th win for the second consecutive season, first time that’s happened since 2002-2003
 They’ve won five consecutive National League East titles, a run reminiscent if not yet resembling the 14 straight East championships they captured from 1991-2005
And in identifying, acquiring and ultimately signing nearly a dozen players to long-term contracts, they’ve assured that the end of this run is nowhere in sight – while ensuring the atmosphere that produced it lives on

Mathews isn’t the only Hall of Famer needing to step aside
 Ace Spencer Strider’s final start of the year will likely yield the three strikeouts needed to pass John Smoltz’s club record of 275; Strider will also vie for his 20th win of the season in that pre-playoff tune-up
It seems almost impossible that Strider is just three years removed from getting drafted out of Clemson, barely a year after Tommy John surgery
 Yet he clearly landed in the right spot
“It’s all about winning, and the organization’s commitment to being consistently competitive and doing things like calling guys up when other organizations maybe wouldn’t,” says Strider, whose 274 strikeouts lead the major leagues
 "That kind of constant commitment to it is very obvious at every level of the organization
 Consequently, they want to do things like make a comfortable environment for players, through amenities and everything else and that goes as far as offering guys contracts and trying to find consistency
"When you find a product on the field capable of winning, you want to get it to stay and that’s something that means a lot to players
"They have let their pens do the talking
No, Braves president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos does not put anything in the food to compel his players to stay
 Yet they just keep coming back
Seven core Braves are signed to long-term deals through at least 2027, with Riley’s deal extending all the way through 2033 should the club pick up an option year
 The wave of permanence began when Acuña ($110 million) and second baseman Ozzie Albies ($35 million) each signed long-term extensions in April 2019, when both barely had any service time
While both have significantly outperformed those deals, the long-term core has only grown around them
It doesn’t hurt that the Braves continue to draft, develop, acquire and ultimately sign players hailing from what’s known as Braves Country – a baseball-rich swath of the South
 Olson, from suburban Atlanta, signed a $168 million extension hours after the Braves acquired him from the Oakland A’s
Outfielder Michael Harris signed a $70 million extension to stay in his hometown during his rookie season
 Strider attended high school in Knoxville
 Riley grew up a bit further away – just south of Memphis – but his Atlanta roots are only deepening
"The grass isn’t always greener on the other side," says Riley
 "The Braves have treated me with the utmost respect
 They’ve always been fair to me, honest with me, and from a workplace, there’s nothing more you could ask for
"For me, my wife’s got family in Atlanta, my parents and her parents are only five hours away
 The stars aligned
 I think a lot of guys come over here and see that we have fun, we keep things light, but we also have to work hard
"Those two combos are important for 162 (games)
 And guys that come over see it – and they buy in
"Now, they’re barely more than a week away from a return playoff engagement, a strange limbo that will be part coronation, part trepidation
 Olson and Strider and Acuña and others will rack up records and milestones, while manager Brian Snitker warily eyes the health of a roster not exactly peaking physically
Left-handed starter Max Fried is on the injured list with a fingernail issue, while veteran right-hander Charlie Morton will miss the National League Division Series with a finger sprain
 The maladies are annoyances, to be certain, but this group’s October odysseys let them know playoff baseball is almost fated
They were below 
500 at the 2021 All-Star break, Acuña laid up with a torn ACL, then rallied to win the World Series
 They had that coveted first-round bye last year, then saw the nothing-to-lose Philadelphia Phillies steamroll them in four games of the NLDS
The Phillies may pop up on their radar again
 The Braves, while knowing any outcome is possible, will likely remain unbothered
“We’re not very reactive as a group
 We’re committed to the long-term approach," says Strider
 "And playing in October, we know you can win 100 games in the regular season and it doesn’t really matter if you don’t go out and win in October
"There’s not a great amount of panic if something doesn’t go right
 Guys just show up and do what they’re good at
"Every day
"And all those every days have turned into five consecutive years of dominance – with no end in sight

"Each year, millions of travelers are drawn to Grand Canyon National Park
Even though it’s widely photographed, nothing compares to seeing this natural wonder of the world in person
 Its sheer size (277 miles), as well as the marvel of its formation millions of years ago through erosion from the Colorado River, make it a special place
And whether hiking or riding a mule to the bottom, or soaking in views along the rim, visitors are awed by its striking, steep walls of limestone, shale and sandstone rock
Here’s what travelers should know about the Grand Canyon, one of America’s most popular national parks and the latest in USA TODAY’s yearlong series
 Nature's grand spectacle of towering red rocks lies along the Colorado River in northwest Arizona
But not all of it is managed by the National Park Service
 The park notes popular Havasu Falls and Grand Canyon Skywalk sit on tribal lands, and a portion of the canyon also extends into Kaibab National Forest
The nearest major airport to the park’s popular South Rim is Phoenix Sky Harbor International, That’s upwards of 3
5 hours away by car
 However, American Airlines offers service to Flagstaff Pulliam Airport, which is 1
5 hours away by car
Grand Canyon’s West Rim is roughly 125 miles away from Las Vegas
This part of the canyon lies within the Hualapai Indian Reservation, not the national park
 Admission to Grand Canyon West starts at $49
 Access to the Grand Canyon Skywalk, a glass-bottom walkway that extends out over the canyon, costs extra
 Eleven tribes are historically associated with the canyon, according to the park: Both are beautiful
The vast majority of people visit the South Rim, which is about 230 miles from Phoenix and is open year-round
 It features stunning overlooks like Mather Point and Hopi Point and the park’s most popular trail into the canyon, Bright Angel Trail
The far-less-traveled North Rim is located about 350 miles from Phoenix
 It also offers scenic vistas, as well as hiking and camping opportunities with fewer crowds
 But services, lodging, campgrounds and restaurants are only available from mid-May to mid-October
 North Rim roads are completely closed from December through mid-May
 Some of the most adventurous travelers brave the 21-mile Rim-to-Rim hike connecting the South and North Rims
Visitors who prefer to drive can take a 215-mile journey from North Rim Village to South Rim Village
There’s also a scenic 23-mile drive, Desert View Drive, between Grand Canyon Village and Desert View in the South Rim
There is a $35 entry fee for private vehicles at the park
 Entry passes are good for seven days
Standard campsite fees start at $18 nightly
 Backcountry camping costs $10 plus extra nightly fees depending on the number of campers and location above or below the canyon rim
There are also several lodges in Grand Canyon Village and an RV park, managed by third parties whose rates range widely by season and venue
 For example, a one-night stay for two adults and two children can cost under $100 at Bright Angel Lodge or Maswik Lodge in February and roughly $580 at El Tovar Hotel in June
Free admission:When you can visit national parks for free this yearSpring and autumn months offer milder temperatures and fewer crowds than the summer, though fall weekends still see crowds
 Winter can be serene, but visitors will need to be prepared for snowy weather and road closures
Sean Baumstark said the damage to his walker could have been much worse, but he’s still annoyed by what happened on a Southwest Airlines flight
“This incident is child’s play compared to the many others, but it started with, first, my walker or rollator being left at the departure city,” he told USA TODAY
 He traveled from Sacramento to Las Vegas on July 13 and it wasn’t until the next day that his walker caught up with him
Baumstark, who has Friedreich’s Ataxia, said his rollator is an important mobility aid even if he isn’t completely reliant on it 100% of the time, and he was frustrated to find it was damaged in addition to being delayed when he went to pick it up
“I immediately said (to the agent at the airport) ‘that’s broken, we need to notate that
 It’s still functional, I’ll take it, but this is not the way I gave it to you,’ ” he said
 The broken piece was the carrying basket, and although the walker still worked as a mobility aid, he said the damage effected how easy the device was to use
“If I’m trying to carry my coffee because I don’t have a bag to put it in, that makes it difficult while using the rollator,” he said
 “It does have a domino effect in making things challenging
 This is so vain, but there’s a vanity piece to it, too
 If my walker looks broken, that’s embarrassing
” Baumstark said Southwest Airlines’ contractor for mobility device repair, Global Repair Group, initially suggested he fix his rollator himself
“I responded with no, that’s not good enough for me, for two reasons
 My disability makes it difficult for me to tinker with small parts or small areas, so dexterity, muscle control, all of that is not my forte,” he said
 “More importantly to me, I didn’t want to invest any more of my time on their mistake
” Baumstark had already had to take an Uber back and forth from the airport to pick up his delayed and damaged device
 Baumstark said he has not received any reimbursement for his rideshares
 Southwest previously said it works with all customers who have mobility device damage occur while traveling
 “Our teams have been in touch with the customer to assist them with their individual situation,” the airline said in a statement to USA TODAY
Ultimately, Global Repair Group agreed to replace Baumstark’s walker, and he said the new device was waiting for him at home when he returned from his trip
 Although he said the system for repair and replacement worked “flawlessly as designed” in his situation, he still feels airlines could do much better overall
He said there should be better training for baggage handlers and that airlines should continue working to develop in-cabin wheelchair securement seats
 In addition, he said airline employees should just be more accommodating overall
“Maybe a little more empathy would be good
 There’s a massive lack of that,” he said
 “The facial expressions and the tone of voice lead me to believe that they take it personally that I’m asking for a preboard pass
”Cruising Altitude:That's not where I wanted to go: What to know about flight diversionsAccording to the Department of Transportation, airlines "mishandle" on average about 1
5% of the mobility equipment they transport
 In 2022, that translated to 11,389 incidents reported by U
S
 airlines, up from 7,239 in 2021
This year, USA TODAY wants to highlight what those figures mean for travelers with disabilities
 We're looking to track these incidents throughout 2023 with the goal of bringing light to an all-too-common problem

comNorway offers some of the world’s best views of the northern lights
 In fact, two cruise operators in the region are so confident travelers will see the aurora borealis, they’ll give passengers a free cruise if they don’t
Havila Voyages and Hurtigruten Norway both offer a Northern Lights Promise, giving passengers a second voyage if the aurora borealis doesn’t turn up
Havila offers the deal on 12-day Bergen-Kirkenes-Bergen round-trip itineraries departing from Oct
 1-March 31, 2024
 The operator said if “spectacular green light does not dance across the night sky” during the trip, they can get a free six or seven-day voyage, according to its website
Hurtigruten’s guarantee is valid for select cruises 11 days or longer during the same dates
 If the northern lights cannot be seen from the ship during the trip, passengers can take a six or seven-day Original Coastal Express Classic Voyage at no charge
 The offer is also available for Hurtigruten Expeditions – soon to be renamed HX – voyages
“Our ships act as floating, mobile observatories that move between areas where there is a lot of cloud cover to places where it’s clear skies and perfect conditions to see the aurora when it appears,” Hurtigruten said on its website
Havila passengers must activate the Northern Lights Warning System, which alerts them to the atmospheric phenomenon’s presence, to be eligible
 Passengers must book the new cruise within one month of returning from the first voyage
The offer is good for an inside cabin, but guests can upgrade for an extra cost as availability allows
Northern lights:Graphics illustrate why the phenomenon's wonder is spreadingHurtigruten guests have 28 days from the time they return to book a new cruise, which they can take between Oct
 1 and March 31 “during the subsequent sailing season,” according to its website
 They must also make sure their alert system is activated
The Hurtigruten offer is good for an inside cabin, as well, with the option to pay to upgrade if other room types are available

UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay
Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports
Their partnership should have been a force for good
 Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against
The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports
 Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work
Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work
 Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game
But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation
According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated
 His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit
“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY
 “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me
”In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode
 According to him, they had consensual “phone sex
”“Ms
 Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator
 “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition
”Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint
 She finished her investigation in July
 A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct
 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week
The stakes are high for everyone
Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports
 She fears he will undo her legacy
Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches
Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case
Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case
“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference
 “These actions are not taken lightly
”USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment
 Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity
 Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent
Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history
For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U
S
A
 Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments
 He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison
Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence
For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress
“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence
 “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people
”Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them
Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two
At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior
By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches
 Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee
Tucker was in his second season as head coach
 A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018
 Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary
Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timelineTucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator
 They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls
Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator
 They discussed her coming back to campus in the future
Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator
 He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person
Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players
During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour
 They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said
 They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives
They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time
In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance
 The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University
”It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator
Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge
Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it
They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said
 Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married
Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them
By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided
 She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her
Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said
 Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit
Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime
 He was in bed, shirtless
 He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single
” Then, during a Nov
 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries
 She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec
 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree
Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show
 Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him
 She said no
Twelve days later came the call
Tracy was in her home office in Oregon
 Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a
m
 EST, phone records show
 The call lasted 36 minutes
According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on
 They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed
“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show
 “She was the one who said we’ll do it
”Tracy denies all of that
 The call started off normal, she said
 But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man
”She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks
 She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself
“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report
 Tucker responded, “Yes
”Tracy said she thought to herself, "Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it
" In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up
 Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it
”When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart
” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up
Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying
Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke
At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened
 Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that
Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages
 And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place
 A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason
When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems
Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about
” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him
Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong
 According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened
”Tucker recalled the Aug
 2 phone call much differently
 He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted
 Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy
The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again
Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said
 Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable
She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call
 In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day
Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator
 In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain
“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22
 “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness
”The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation
A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan
Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits
Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker
Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad
Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone
Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem
 She shared a screenshot of a Dec
 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends
“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote
Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone
Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March
 In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation
Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement
 Tracy said no
Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint
 In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy
They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent
“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote
 “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”Michigan State was not persuaded
 The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship
The case would go forward
Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22
He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight
 But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies
For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel
 He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school
Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime
An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel
 The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane
Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program
 But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28
During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona
 The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business
”Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation
“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY
 “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN
”Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity
 That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied
Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July
Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other
 Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him
Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing
At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments
 Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules
Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado
 She died in a car accident in June
Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed
”Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly
One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses
 They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies
A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University
”“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed

On a sunny Thursday morning, Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker strolled through tomato fields at a farm in Immokalee, Florida, toured its processing plants and loaded baskets of bright green fruit into a truck
 It was a private event thrown by the school to promote its migrant student services program, which provides financial aid and support to farmworkers seeking college degrees
 After the April 28, 2022, tour, disclosed in records obtained by USA TODAY this week, Tucker met with community leaders and alumni
That night, Tucker would make the now-infamous phone call from his hotel room in nearby Naples, during which he is accused of masturbating and making unwanted sexual comments to Brenda Tracy, a prominent rape survivor and activist he had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence
Yet, when Tucker met with the university’s outside investigator in March for his interview in the sexual harassment case against him, he insisted the trip was not work-related – a claim the investigator would disprove in her report
It’s just one example of Tucker failing to keep his story straight at the most consequential moment of his career
 With his job, reputation and the roughly $80 million left on his contract at stake, Tucker repeatedly made false statements to the investigator and misled her about basic facts, such as his location during the phone call and the date it occurred, a USA TODAY review of more than 1,200 pages of case documents found
 The investigator, Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, and the news organization both obtained documents and witness statements that discredit key aspects of Tucker’s version of events
 Michigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sept
 10, hours after Tracy went public for the first time with her story in USA TODAY
 On Monday, the school informed Tucker it plans to fire him for cause based on the conduct he had admitted to and the embarrassment he had caused the school
 Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivorAlthough Tucker denied sexually harassing Tracy, he acknowledged masturbating on the call, saying he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex
” Tracy said Tucker’s romantic interest in her was completely one-sided and that she had tried to set boundaries multiple times during their yearlong business partnership
Per his contract, Tucker has until Tuesday to make a case for keeping his job
 Regardless, a formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated school policies against sexual harassment and exploitation is expected to proceed on Oct
 5 and 6
 Since his suspension, Tucker has issued multiple public statements defending himself, attacking Tracy and accusing Veidlinger of bias
 He accused the school of conducting a “sham” hearing and having “ulterior motives
” Yet even in these written statements, the central details of his story changed entirely
Tucker, who previously hung up on a reporter who called him on his cellphone asking about the case, did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story
 His attorney, Jennifer Belveal, has not responded to phone calls and emails
 Tracy declined to comment for this story
In the absence of eyewitnesses or recordings, sexual harassment cases usually boil down to whose account is more credible, said Elizabeth Abdnour, a Lansing-based attorney and former Michigan State Title IX investigator who has taken part in dozens of campus cases
“It’s very, very unusual that you would have some outside piece of evidence that would give you a clear decision,” Abdnour said
 “Very often you’re weighing credibility based on little bits and pieces of information
” In multiple cases she has worked, Abdnour said the respondents lost because they were found to have a greater propensity for lying than the complainants
 The hearing officer must determine how much weight to give Tucker’s false and conflicting statements, Abdnour said, and they could sway the case in Tracy’s favor
“I believe a fact finder could assess these pieces of evidence about credibility and make a determination that Brenda is more credible than Mel,” she said
 “In my experience, a clear sign of a lack of credibility is generally taken very seriously
”By the time Tucker met with Veidlinger for his interview, he had had months to prepare
The school had informed him of Tracy’s complaint on Dec
 22, the day after she filed it
 Veidlinger had interviewed Tracy and all six of her witnesses by the end of January
 Tucker was the only holdout
Rather than tell his side of the story right away, Tucker and his attorney spent three months trying to stop the investigation, case documents show
 They wrote legal arguments urging Michigan State to drop the case and twice approached Tracy’s attorney proposing a settlement agreement
 Tracy said no, and the school pressed forward
On March 22, the day of his interview, Tucker sent Veidlinger a seven-page written account of his interactions with Tracy and lists of their “currently existing” text message and call history, which he said his legal team had compiled
 Only a handful of text messages remained; he and Tracy both told the investigator they had deleted their texts with each other in the months after the April 2022 phone call
In his interview, which lasted 3 ½ hours, Tucker questioned whether Tracy had mixed up the date of the call
 He said he recalled being at his home in East Lansing when it occurred, but his own records showed that he had been in Florida on April 28, attending a charity function that was “absolutely not a University-sponsored event
”His seven-page account told a different story – that he had called her while he was “alone in a hotel room
”Veidlinger does not appear to have asked Tucker about the discrepancy, based on case documents
 But by then she knew what he told her in the interview was untrue: she had already obtained records proving he had not been home in East Lansing
An expense report he had submitted to the university for reimbursement of his hotel and meals shows Tucker flew to Naples, Florida, to attend a golf fundraiser hosted by The Greg H
 Montgomery Jr
 Foundation for Ultimate Growth, which raises awareness for suicide prevention
 It showed he stayed at the Hilton from April 27 to 29, that the trip’s purpose was “administrative” and that it did not involve personal travel
 He had flown there on a donor’s private plane
The trip is when Tucker toured the farm in Immokalee to help promote Michigan State’s College Assistance Migrant Program
 The event was titled “Working to make dreams a reality,” according to an agenda obtained from the university by USA TODAY through a public records request
 The agenda features Tucker’s name prominently
 Tucker posted photos from the tour on his Twitter account
That Tucker was on a university-sponsored work trip during the incident was a contributing factor in the university’s determination that it had jurisdiction to investigate, the investigation report shows
 Tucker’s lists of calls and text messages also were missing an important detail: They did not show any communication with Tracy on April 28
 He acknowledged in the interview, however, that he had not reviewed the lists before submitting them and that they may have been incomplete
Tracy, meanwhile, had already provided Veidlinger with her official cellphone records from Sprint that confirmed the date of their call: April 28
Tucker and Tracy did not speak in the three months after the April 28 call
Meanwhile, their assistants were planning Tracy’s third visit to campus – an in-person training with coaches and players scheduled for July 25
Tucker canceled that training three days before, the investigation report shows
 When Tracy spoke to him by phone on Aug
 2 seeking to find out why, she would tell the investigator in her interview that Tucker insinuated he would harm her career if she spoke about his conduct
 He never rescheduled her visit, and they never spoke again
The cancellation became a key focus of the investigator – one of a series of alleged incidents that taken together would meet the definition of sexual harassment, which can include pressuring someone into engaging in sexual behavior for an employment benefit and threatening that rejecting such behavior will carry a negative consequence
“Reported allegations that a University employee is engaging in misconduct within the vendor-vendee relationship for which they are the decision-maker, and/or impeding in such a services relationship based on a quid-pro-quo sexual harassment allegation, is within a University sponsored program or activity,” Veidlinger wrote in the report, so school policy covered it
Tucker tried to distance himself from the cancellation in a public statement on Sept
 11, the day after Michigan State suspended him without pay
“I never cancelled any presentation,” he wrote
 “Given a personnel change and scheduling challenges as football season approached, we merely postponed it until January 2023
 She chose to file her complaint instead of proceeding with the training
”But that statement contradicts what he told the investigator
 When Veidlinger asked in his March interview if he had a role in canceling Tracy’s visit, Tucker said, “Yes, absolutely I did,” the report shows, and that he did not recall any discussions about rescheduling Tracy for January
 Such timing would not make sense, he added, because most of his new players would not yet be on campus
 Tucker also told the investigator why he canceled the visit, blaming it on a scheduling conflict
 He said he had recently hired a mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, who needed to implement his new program on short notice
 There was limited time in fall camp, Tucker said, and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” the players
 He said he decided to yield the time to Newman
Veidlinger, however, would later obtain records showing Newman did not meet with the team on July 25, the day of Tracy’s planned visit
 He had been meeting with them weekly since June 6, the records showed but held no meetings between July 15 and July 28
One of Tucker’s assistants, who is a witness in the case, also told the investigator that Tucker asked him via text message to cancel it
 He said he was never instructed to reschedule
 In his interview, Tucker told Veidlinger that his relationship with Tracy frayed after the April 2022 phone call – not because of the incident, but because of information he learned after that caused him not to trust her
According to Tucker, an associate of his had told him over the summer that Tracy’s assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, had been gossiping about Tucker’s marriage, telling others it was “on the rocks
” Tucker said he was “devastated” because he had confided in Tracy about his marital problems, and he believed she had discussed them with Alvarado
Tucker confronted Tracy about the alleged gossiping during the Aug
 2 phone call, they both told the investigator
 Tracy said he berated and bullied her, repeatedly saying he could not trust her
 She said she told him she did not know what he was talking about
Alvarado – who was killed in a car crash in June – would deny discussing Tucker’s marriage with anyone in her January interview with Veidlinger
 During the Aug
 2 call, Tracy said she pressed Tucker to identify his source – the associate
 She told Veidlinger she believed Tucker had made it up as a pretext for canceling her visit and ending her relationship with the school
Veidlinger also asked Tucker to reveal the source of his claim, but he refused to say
 In her report, she wrote that he said he had “given (his) word that (he) wouldn’t divulge their name
” Tucker never revealed the associate’s name to the investigator, nor did he identify anyone who could support his version of events
 In his Sept
 11 public statement, however, he lamented that the hearing would not afford him the opportunity to “offer any substantive evidence of innocence
”It was not the only claim he attributed to his anonymous associate
 In his interview, he said that same person told him that ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating how Tracy “goes about her business” by claiming to be a rape survivor
  Tucker said this further caused him to believe Tracy was untrustworthy because she believed Lavigne was her friend but didn’t know she was investigating the rape story at the center of her public persona
 It turned out to be yet another falsehood
Reached by USA TODAY, Lavigne said in an emailed statement that she was “perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN
” She said Tracy has been a source of information for her for several years, and that she has featured Tracy’s comments and advocacy work in multiple news stories
“That has been the extent of my reporting on Tracy and her organization,” Lavigne wrote
 “Neither the organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting
”Asked who might have told Tucker this misinformation, Lavigne responded, “I have absolutely no idea who would have alleged this to anyone

The bullets came in plywood crates
 Any given box was about the size of a small microwave oven
 The printed label stuck to each one demonstrated a militaristic brevity
 “CARTRIDGES FOR WEAPONS, INERT PROJECTILE,” next to a bright yellow hazmat sticker, “EXPLOSIVES
” Inside the boxes: drab green steel cans of 
50-caliber ammunition
 Each round was giant, more than 5 inches long, built to be fired from a gun so big it is typically bolted to a truck
 The bullets were clipped together in long strands for rapid, machine-gun fire
 By the time Bill Brown got to the boxes, they sat double-stacked eight high atop wooden pallets inside a Missouri warehouse
 The pallets went on, row after row
 Three million bullets in all
 It was enough ammunition to feed a single machine gun – if fired nonstop at its rated speed eight hours a day, seven days a week – for almost six months
 Brown’s job was to get it out of there and toward the Ukrainian front lines
 The faster, the better
 “War is bad,” Brown said
 “Loss of life is bad
 But at the end of the day, it’s very profitable and injects revenue into this military industrial base
”There would be virtually no public record of this Ukrainian arms shipment
 As a weapons dealer, Brown’s company would deliver the bullets under a system known as a direct commercial sale
 The ammunition required a State Department signoff – but the secret deal would never appear in a White House announcement or the Congressional Record
 Instead, it was part of a shadowy system of brokers, exporters, arms dealers and country-to-country transfers that has become one part of the race to meet demand on distant battlefields
 Western weaponry fueled Ukraine’s summertime counteroffensive along a 600-mile front
 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the effort was delayed in part by the wait for more arms
 Amid concerns about that slowly progessing counteroffensive, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday with a promise of up to $175 million more in military equipment
 Most of America’s $44 billion in documented support to Ukraine came in the form of old U
S
 military stock, donated directly by the federal government
 In general, commercial sales over $14 million, and sales of military-grade weaponry like mortars or missiles, require State Department approval and congressional notification
But other aid comes via private sales
 More than 14,000 U
S
 entities are registered to conduct defense trade activities
 Their deals are monitored by an alphabet soup of agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
 Trade secrecy clauses in federal law mean this flow of gear, weapons and ammunition is almost never revealed to the public
Brown, who works for a small Nevada-based logistics company called Battle Born Munitions, provided USA TODAY with a rare look behind the curtain of these private sales
 Details about the shipment were verified by his employer and the European government that made the purchase
 State Department officials declined to answer questions about the specific shipment Brown described
This March sale and the secret number of other shipments like it fuel Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion
 Those sales also release an unknown amount of weaponry into the world
 What becomes of that weaponry after it’s sold – and especially after it’s delivered – is difficult to track
 As Brown surveyed the warehouse in Missouri, a crew steered forklifts and skid lifts among the stacks of plain wooden boxes
 From high in the trusses, suspended lamp fixtures bathed the boxes in artificial daylight
 Brown lifted his camera and started snapping photos
 In just a few hours, he and his cargo would be boarding a jumbo jet
 Three million bullets would climb to the stratosphere and hurtle across the north Atlantic toward a European dawn
From Ukraine:War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented
 So is the country's push for swift justice
The bullets had once been bound for Saudi Arabia
 Lot number SMQ19K401L026 had rolled off the assembly line in 2019 at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Kansas City
 Lake City, owned by the government and run by a contractor, sprawls across nearly 4,000 acres of green Missouri farmland
 Roads curve past World War II-era bunkers known as igloos, spaced out amid the countryside – far enough apart that an explosion in one won’t trigger a chain reaction in the others
Lake City has been pumping out ammunition almost without pause since 1941
 It is the largest small-arms manufacturing plant in the world
Today the plant is run by Olin-Winchester, but in 2019, the bullets were made by some of the 1,700 workers employed by Northrop Grumman
 And in 2019, Saudi Arabia was stocking up on weapons during the Trump administration, fueling the war in Yemen and other conflicts that drew criticism from congressional Democrats
The plant manufactures 
50-caliber ammunition on a rolling basis, for both military and commercial buyers
 That’s a testament to just what a legend the bullet – and the gun that shoots it – has become
In 2019, the technology was already a century old
 The 
50 caliber was the brainchild of American gunsmith John Browning during World War I
 Built to respond to German anti-tank rifles, the M2 was first tested in 1918, and it entered widespread service in 1923
 It earned the nickname “Ma Deuce” and has served in combat ever since, bolted to trucks, ships, planes and handheld stands on the battlefield
The 
50-caliber rounds – named for their diameter, about half an inch – can easily hit targets more than a mile away
 At closer ranges, they will blast through solid concrete or armored vehicles
 The gun can fire at a sustained rate of about 40 shots per minute
Military setups use strings of “linked” ammunition to feed into machine guns
 Spaced out after every fourth bullet, so-called tracer rounds have small pyrotechnic charges that illuminate the line of fire, aiding in targeting
The gun’s longevity and versatility made it popular for militaries the world over
 But this particular batch of bullets wouldn’t end up being sold to Saudi Arabia
 The Biden administration put a temporary freeze on sales to the Saudi government in 2021 as it reviewed weapons deals approved under Donald Trump
 Instead, Brown said, the bullets were sold to a U
S
 ammunition provider, only to be held up again
 Ultimately, they were mothballed
 Then, in spring 2023, the bullets found a buyer, or actually two: first Battle Born; ultimately, the Netherlands
 The European country, a NATO ally, needed a big supply of ammunition
 It wouldn’t be keeping the bullets but giving them to Ukraine
 Its purchase, essentially a donation, would count toward the country’s required NATO contribution
 Brown had a line on exactly what they needed
 It was sitting in the warehouse in Missouri
 He arrived in March to personally oversee the shipment
 As he prepped for delivery, Brown dropped tiny black tracking devices onto several of the pallets
 Just $55 apiece, the units use GPS and cell signals to keep tabs on the load
 The idea was to ensure it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands
 But packing up the bullets was just the beginning
 As with anything that’s deadly and made of metal, the shipping costs can be extreme
 Brown said the question for the buyer was simple: “How fast do you want it? Forty-five to 60 days on a ship? Or in five days if I fly it?”Brown – or Chief Bill, as he prefers – is a no-nonsense 35-year veteran of the U
S
 Army and former helicopter pilot
 He retired as a chief warrant officer and lives in Orlando
 Now 59, he still spends a lot of time on the road – 10 international trips this year
 He says his arms logistics work takes him to places most Americans would rather avoid – near the Syrian border or to unstable regions of Iraq
He’ll travel halfway around the world, he quips, “have some soup, and go back to Warsaw to head home
” The trips aren’t really about the destinations
 They’re about the cargo
 On that spring day in Missouri, forklifts carefully loaded 107 pallets of the ammo onto 18 flatbed semitrailers
 They’d all make the eight-hour drive to O’Hare International Airport
 In Chicago, two Boeing 747-400s operated by National Airlines would be ready for the freight
 Four pallets each were stacked and shrink-wrapped to create “air pallets” or “cookie sheets” weighing 12,800 pounds
 Each plane could carry up to 17 of the pallets that ran the length of each plane secured by white cargo netting
Flight records Brown provided show the two planes departed about seven hours apart, one in early afternoon, one after dark
 The flight would take nine hours
 Brown wasn’t going to the Netherlands, even though it was the buyer
 The planes were bound for Rzeszów, Poland
 The ancient city sits at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland
 It has a gleaming modern airport next to a major east-west freeway
 From there, it’s barely 60 miles to the border with Ukraine
 It was an expensive journey
 The trucking company’s bill for those 18 semis? $85,000
 Chartering the two 747s? $625,000
 Each
But this shipment of 
50-cal rounds was profitable for Battle Born Munitions, according to Brown
The company purchased the 3 million rounds from Northrop Grumman at a bargain and resold them for more than double the price
 (In subsequent interviews, representatives at BBM disputed the specific totals Brown mentioned, saying the accurate figures were protected by “various commercial and government non-disclosure agreements
” They did not dispute the other specifics of the deal he provided
) Retail prices for 
50-caliber ammunition run roughly $5 per bullet
 At that rate, the whole shipment would have been worth $15 million
The pricing might also be elastic
 The Dutch mark up the price of the bullets and count it toward their NATO contribution, pegged to a percentage of gross domestic product, Brown said
 The Netherlands has contributed about $15 billion to NATO this year, or about 1
7% of its GDP and just under the NATO mandate of 2%
Representatives of the Dutch military confirmed the shipment to USA TODAY but declined to comment further about the pricing or details
The war in Ukraine has only increased the demand for private deals
 The State Department signed off on more than $154 billion in commercial arms deals directly to foreign countries in 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year
 Direct commercial sales represent a modest portion of the contribution to Ukraine compared with the $44 billion donated by the U
S
, but they still amounted to more than $600 million in sales from U
S
 companies to the Ukrainian government last year alone
 That doesn’t include sales to other countries that also support Ukraine – sales like the one Brown described
Jim Bartlett, an attorney with expertise in the specialized international arms transactions, said private U
S
 businesses are playing a small but important role in the conflict
“American companies are happy to export defense articles to foreign buyers approved by the U
S
 State Department,” Bartlett said
 “There’s an effort at the State Department to quickly clear the ones headed for Ukraine
 … You get head-of-the-line privileges
”Those sales also come with risks
 Direct sales face fewer regulatory controls, oversight and enforcement, said Robert Nichols, an international military sales expert and attorney at the law firm Nichols Liu
“You can imagine the range of characters involved in supplying a war effort,” Nichols said
 “Some are highly credible
 Others will skirt the law and sometimes step over the line by paying bribes, committing fraud and hiding their transactions
” So far, the Department of Justice has indicted just a handful of arms brokers over deals related to the war in Ukraine
 Court records show the government has charged Miami-based Oleg Patsulya and Vasilii Besedin with illegally attempting to sell American-made aircraft parts to Russia
 They allegedly lied to Commerce Department agents and told them the parts were bound for Turkey
 Both pleaded not guilty to the charges this summer
 A State Department spokesman declined to provide details of enforcement actions but said, “The United States takes seriously our responsibility to protect American military and dual-use technologies and prevent their diversion, including through strong enforcement actions
”NATO said it oversees allied arms deliveries, and that those arms generally reach Ukraine
 NATO itself technically only provides non-non-lethal aid, like fuel, medical supplies and generators
Brown, of Battle Born, says he fields calls weekly from “clowns” without the proper licensing, whom he reports to the State Department for potential violations
 Some raise red flags when they approach him about transactions that include payment via diamonds or gold
He prefers traditional wire transfers with approved sales partners since he knows government officials are watching
 He validates the contracts and checks certificates for the final users
 That’s part of why he traveled with the ammunition
 He would be meeting a Dutch military official for the official handoff
“My job is to keep us all out of jail,” Brown said
 The two 747s touched down in Poland, one before the sun, the other in late morning
 Brown exchanged paperwork with a young Dutch military staffer who signed for the delivery, he said
 They traded military patches as souvenirs
 They snapped a photo together
 The bullets bought by the Netherlands would never touch Dutch soil
 U
S
 aid:Billions from the US flows to Ukraine
 Here's where it comes from, and how it adds upDespite playing a small role proportionately in the war, $600 million in direct commercial sales can buy a lot of small weaponry
 And those weapons are the kind most apt to fall into illicit use, said Elias Yousif, a research analyst at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit think tank
Put another way: It’s hard to sneak away an F-16 or a missile launcher the size of a tractor-trailer
 But a bunch of guns or a pallet of ammo? Much easier to resell
 “In the commercial sector, especially in a new market, the risk increases,” Yousif said
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss arms research project, estimated that within a year, battlefield seizures and other forms of diversion led to 300,000 small arms and light weapons going missing, including 100,000 in Crimea alone
When small arms go missing, they can go missing into another country, maybe one led by a despot or even a terrorist organization
The U
S
 government says diversion of American donations has been widely absent so far in Ukraine
 That could be a combination of intensive “end-use-monitoring” programs and the reality of the battlefield, where supplies are rapidly put to use
But even if not now, unused ammo could be resold someday
 “History shows us this isn’t a short-term issue,” Yousif said
  “These are commodities with very long shelf lives
” Florida-based Global Ordnance, another State Department-licensed exporter, is a competitor in the direct weapons sales business
 General counsel Bryan Van Brunt said the company has extensive protocols in place to track shipments and make sure the end-users are federally approved, though he declined to provide specifics about those systems
 Brown, with Battle Born Munitions, says the company employs a mix of simple and sophisticated tracking technology to ensure his shipments are tracked to end users
 The black GPS devices he dropped onto his cargo tracked the ammo all the way across the globe
But that system only works as long as Brown is actually tracking
 “Technically, my role ends when I deliver it to NATO,” he said
Sometime after the 747s touched down in Poland, along with signing the paperwork and snapping a selfie with the Dutch official, Brown found the tiny black GPS trackers and lifted them off the pallets
 Ukrainian trucks would arrive at the airport to pick up the ammunition
 They would point toward the border, and onward to Lviv, and some distant battlefield
 Brown would point in the opposite direction
 Just like one of his quips: Fly in, have soup, get home
 He headed toward Warsaw, with the GPS trackers in his bag

The geography professor didn’t hide his clown fetish or the fact that he sometimes indulged his urges by recruiting students as subjects
 He posted regularly about it on social media
“I have a facepaint fetish and convince the cute girls in my classes to let me paint their faces,” he once wrote
Yet Joseph Tokosh held jobs at two colleges and was on the tenure track at a third before student journalists at Nicholls State University in Louisiana exposed his behavior
 He submitted his resignation the same day their story was published
His interactions with students and open discussion of his fetish happened in both mainstream and tailored digital spaces
 He popped into Facebook groups geared toward new students and niche forums on websites like Reddit
 He posted videos on YouTube
 In one Reddit post on a forum meant to highlight hard-to-believe stories, Tokosh posted pictures of several women in white face paint
Over the years, two students reported him to campus police; others complained online
 He left Kent State University after pleading no contest to something different: a theft charge that involved entering his peers’ offices without permission and taking a USB drive
 Tokosh has not been charged with any other crime
Tokosh’s career trajectory exposes inadequacies in the background check system that colleges and universities are supposed to have in place to protect students – especially when evidence of the concerning behavior resides largely on the internet
 Nicholls State, for example, told USA TODAY Network reporters it does not routinely check social media for new hires
A federal law intended to ensure the academic privacy of students also makes it difficult to determine how Tokosh was able to move so freely from campus to campus
 Both Kent State and Northern Illinois University – where he taught while finishing his doctorate – noted Tokosh’s protected status as a graduate student in declining to answer questions
Sophie Levan was a freshman at Kent State in 2017 when she encountered Tokosh, then 28, in a Facebook group intended as a gathering place for new students
 Tokosh had offered cash to anyone willing to let him paint their faces
 Levan, then 18, agreed
The money was appealing but the interactions soured
 Tokosh, she said, insisted he come pick her up and take her to the building that housed the geography department, where he would paint her face
 Uneasy, Levan stopped responding
 Tokosh got angry and wouldn’t give up, she said, which led her to file a police report
“I felt like the school would want to know about it,” Levan said
 “I thought maybe they could prevent anything bad from happening since other girls would go with him
”She said there was never any followup from campus police – or anyone else
USA TODAY Network reporters reviewed the experiences of six students who were the subject of Tokosh’s attention going back to his time at Kent State
In addition to Levan, the other person who reported Tokosh to campus police could not be reached for comment
 The two who expressed public concerns on social media told USA TODAY they never heard from their campus officials either
USA TODAY attempted to reach Tokosh via phone, social media and a certified letter
 A person answered a phone call to a number associated with Tokosh, but he hung up after the reporter identified himself
 A reporter also reached someone who identified herself as Tokosh’s mother
 She said she would pass along that reporters were trying to reach him
Tokosh told the Nicholls student journalists that he did have an assignment where students were required to paint their faces as part of a cultural exercise
 Prior to the article in the student newspaper The Nicholls Worth, the university had already cut Tokosh loose
 He said his contract was not renewed because he was the target of a “grade inflation task force
”The university, however, “does not have any such task force,” according to Nicholls spokesman Jerad David
Tokosh also told students the face painting was a requirement in his cultural geography class to better understand other cultures
 In a video interview with Hannah Robert, the station manager for the student-run KNSU TV, he says: “That's an assignment in one of my classes where they actually come up with their own face paint and makeup design inspired by a culture and they implement it
”It’s a well-established trend in the academic world for professors to bounce from one institution to another without having to disclose why they left their last post, said Julie Libarkin, an associate dean at Michigan State University
 She has seen the pattern often in her work maintaining a database of publicly documented sexual misconduct by faculty and staff
As for grad students? Libarkin said people have requested she add them to her list, but universities’ conservative interpretations of the law get in the way
“I don’t on purpose,” she said, “because that’s information that almost never comes out
”Tokosh arrived at Kent State in 2015 with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in geography from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, according to his curriculum vitae
 He was working toward his doctorate and researched fading businesses
 His work about shopping malls in the Rust Belt won several awards
 Like many graduate students, he also taught classes
Then, Tokosh started showing up in the Facebook groups for new students
 In a December 2017 post, an account under the name “Joe Tokosh” posted several pictures of women made up to look like clowns or skulls
“If anyone is looking for some extra cash, I am looking for people to practice facepainting on!” he wrote
 “I will literally pay you!”Those are the types of posts that caught Levan’s eye
 Not only was she pressed for cash, she was interested in movie makeup and thought the face painting could be fun based on the photos Tokosh had posted
 But Levan said she soon realized that those images were stock photos and not representative of what Tokosh could do
What’s more, she figured out that he was a graduate student, a fact she said he didn’t disclose in his posts
When Tokosh offered to pick her up from her dorm, she refused
 But, she said, Tokosh kept insisting she agreed to participate
 Levan stopped responding to his messages and filed a police report with the Kent State police in January 2018
 They advised her only to stop talking to Tokosh, she said, and let them know if “anything of consequence occurred
”Months after she refused to meet up and filed the police report, Tokosh texted a picture of himself wearing white face paint to her cellphone
 It arrived at midnight and contained no message, although writing on his shirt read: “I'm not a failure
”  “There was some negative intention with sending that photo,” Levan said
 “It’s definitely burned into my mind
”What Levan didn’t know is that campus police had been put on notice a year earlier when another student filed a similar report
 That student told police Tokosh reached out to her and her friends after they posted their numbers on a Facebook group for undergraduates
 He would send “get to know you” messages, the police report said, and then ask the student if she was “interested in having her face painted for one of his class projects
”When she found out Tokosh was a graduate student, she said no and eventually blocked him on Facebook and Snapchat, according to the report
 Tokosh continued to text her
“She does not have any concerns for her safety, but just wanted this documented,” the police report read
 In July 2017, another student had retweeted a message from Kent State’s Twitter account that asked for Kent State love stories
 She wrote: “A geography professor requested me on facebook and asked if he could paint my face like a clown
”The student confirmed to USA TODAY that the professor was Tokosh and shared a screenshot of a Facebook friend request he sent her
 She said she suspected Tokosh also found her on a freshman Facebook group because she posted there often
She said she tweeted to draw officials’ attention to it and moved on but now wishes she had reported it officially
College campuses are supposed to offer students special protections from sexual harassment even when it falls short of criminal behavior
 Title IX, often associated with equity in women’s sports, also addresses “sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence” at schools that receive federal funding
Colleges infrequently and unevenly enforce the rule, however
 A 2022 USA TODAY investigation found just one of every 12,400 students was suspended in connection with sexual misconduct
The student who shared her story online said the only response she received was from a graduate student in the geography department, who contacted her on Oct
 1, 2018
 In an email, he wrote that he had seen her post and suspected he knew which faculty member had asked her about face painting
“I brought it to the attention of some of our faculty because I was pretty sure I knew who it was, but they were certain it wasn’t that individual and that you probably just meant geology,” he wrote
 He went on to reference another student being “approached in (at least by just looking at your tweet) a much more aggressive way
” The grad student asked the undergraduate for more information, but, she told USA TODAY, she didn’t respond
 She said she started drafting a reply, but a year had passed
 She wanted to move on
Kent State would not say whether any actions were taken after the students’ reports, but Eric Mansfield, a spokesman for the university, said the police department confirmed that the students who filed police reports were provided with “university resources, which would include other non-criminal avenues to pursue (Counseling Services, Title IX, Center for Sexual and Relationship Violence Services, etc
) as a general police practice
”Levan does not recall police offering her services, but she said she didn’t want counseling
 She wanted Tokosh investigated
Mansfield also said that the university monitors social media but that colleges “can’t always see or track every mention on social media
”Police records show that officers did investigate when Tokosh was accused of breaking into geography department offices
 A blotter item in the local newspaper shows police obtained an arrest warrant in connection with a third-degree felony burglary charge
 Court documents indicate Tokosh pleaded no contest to a theft on Oct
 19, 2018
Kent State would not explain what led to Tokosh’s departure during that fall semester
 Instead, the university said that since Tokosh was a graduate student, any information about him was protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
 It also would not say whether school officials shared Tokosh’s disciplinary record with other colleges or even if it was standard practice to do so for grad students
“Due to FERPA, student education records are private,” said Emily Vincent, a university spokeswoman
 “Also, we do not comment on personnel matters
”When Congress passed FERPA in 1974, its author, Sen
 James L
 Buckley of New York, said the intent was to protect the academic privacy of students and their families
 In more recent years, Buckley has become critical of the law and how schools interpret it
 He told the Columbus Dispatch in 2010 that “the law needs to be revamped
”Survivors of sexual violence and students accuse universities of using the law to avoid negative media coverage
 Students with a history of bad behavior may jump from one school to another without the public ever knowing about their histories
 Law enforcement records don’t fall under FERPA’s purview, but a wide variety of questionable behavior does
One case involved Brandon Austin, who was accused of sexual assault at Providence College in 2013 while on the school’s basketball team
 But Providence College initially said Austin was suspended for violating the school’s code of student conduct and declined to share further details with the Providence Journal, citing federal privacy laws
 Austin denied wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime
 Austin was able to transfer to the University of Oregon, where he was again accused of sexual assault, along with other players
 Police investigated the claims, and the local district attorney declined to press charges
 The university expelled him anyway but raised FERPA when it declined to release records showing what Oregon knew about the allegations, according to the Oregonian
LeRoy Rooker was the director of the U
S
 Education Department office that oversaw FERPA for more than two decades
 Rooker, now a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said FERPA is not a confidentiality law – it is focused on education records
 And it doesn’t apply when a student is “seeking or intending to enroll” at another college
Therefore, Rooker said, Kent State could have shared information about Tokosh with Northern Illinois
Rooker also said FERPA would not have prevented Kent State from telling reporters if other universities had inquired about Tokosh, though they could not have disclosed what they shared
He blamed the overuse of the law on fear of being sued
“In this litigious age, institutions get a little wonky about whether they will forward, say, disciplinary records,” Rooker said
 “On the other hand, if you have something and you don’t share it when you can and something happens at the next institution, I would say that’s a big liability
”Backgrounding job applicants has become increasingly complex
While most U
S
 employers conduct background screening, according to trade group data, those inquiries typically focus on criminal history
 Social media receives far less attention even though that is where people are most likely to share their unguarded thoughts
Undertaking a full review of a person’s social media presence is more difficult than just checking an applicant’s Facebook page
Does an applicant have an account on X, formerly Twitter? How about an account with Discord, an online platform frequented by gamers, where leaked Pentagon documents were recently shared? Or what about a Telegram account, a messaging platform popular among white nationalists? Further complicating things, it’s common on sites like Reddit for users to adopt usernames and describe experiences with little to no ties to reality
A little digging, however, can turn up a lot of dirt
  Tokosh has a LinkedIn page that includes his teaching stints at Northern Illinois University and Nicholls State University
 His time as a student and instructor at Kent State is absent
For LinkedIn, a custom URL includes a play on his name and his chosen field of study: Joeography
 Tokosh would later use that moniker in promotional materials for a class at Nicholls State
 That is the same handle used on Reddit by someone with a special interest in face paint
One post features a video of Tokosh throwing a pie at someone
 Other posts mention a “clown fetish
” In a forum titled “Creepy,” he wrote, “I convince pretty girls to let me paint their faces,” along with a photo with multiple women in white face paint
That and other similar posts remained live for years until they were taken down after the Nicholls students published their story in late March
USA TODAY Network reporters captured screenshots before they disappeared
 With dates in 2019, the posts feature a young woman wearing a Kent State T-shirt
 The material would have been available to administrators at Northern Illinois before the start of the fall 2019 semester
Joe King, a spokesman for Northern Illinois, said departments hiring new graduate students are “not required to check social media or investigate a disciplinary history
” He added some departments may reach out to the graduate students’ former advisers
King said he could not determine if the university was aware of Tokosh’s behavior at Kent State
 He said that due to FERPA, he could not share specifics about Tokosh’s time at Northern Illinois, including whether students had complained about him
But there are signs the behavior continued
A YouTube account under the name “Joe Tokosh” included at least two videos in 2020 of a man throwing pies at women
 One of the videos features a young woman also seen in the screenshots from Tokosh’s Reddit account
 Comments on one from October 2020 read: “You can have a video of her tied up getting pied via cash app
” That video was viewed more than 30,000 times before it was turned off in late July, around the time a USA TODAY reporter reached out to Tokosh
A former Northern Illinois State student shared text messages exchanged with Tokosh in which he asked to paint her face on multiple occasions
 USA TODAY has agreed not to name her because she is concerned Tokosh might retaliate against her
In the text messages, Tokosh shared a photo of a young woman in white face paint – an image also posted to the Joeography Reddit account
 She said she declined to do it but was aware that other Northern Illinois students had participated
By fall 2022, when he had moved on to Nicholls, Tokosh revealed to the student that he had required students in his cultural geography class to paint their faces
  The Northern Illinois student asked Tokosh what he did with the photos, and she said he suggested that he might spin them off into a research project someday
 She asked, had anyone complained? She said Tokosh responded: Why would they?Many students would find a reason to complain, as Nicholls State student journalist Sally-Anne Torres learned firsthand
 It started in January when one of her fellow reporters picked up an odd rumor: a professor was offering extra credit for students willing to paint their faces like clowns
 Initially, Torres dismissed it because it seemed too unusual and there weren’t a lot of leads to follow
 By Feb
 7, university administrators informed Tokosh that his contract would not be renewed, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY via a records request
 They gave no reason for the nonrenewal, but on Feb
 12, Tokosh emailed his students that the university was letting him go
 He blamed his departure on giving too many A’s
That seemed suspicious to Torres
 During her reporting, she received a tip about Tokosh’s Reddit posts in which he wrote of his “clown fetish” and how he enlisted his students to participate in it
“It wasn’t just this innocent thing that a lot of these girls thought it was,” Torres said
 “As a professor or teacher, that is somebody students are supposed to trust
 He used his power to ruin that trust and to do these things, and that made me angry for them
”Torres spoke to six students who shared their experiences with Tokosh
 Some, she said, were followed on Twitter by him while others opted into an extra credit assignment he offered
The women told Torres he sometimes giggled and laughed as they painted their faces in his office
On March 27, the Nicholls Worth published a story headlined, “Geography professor suspended immediately, students allege sexual harassment
” KNSU TV, a student broadcast network, also aired footage in which Tokosh defended the assignment on camera
 That same day, Tokosh submitted his resignation
The story’s publication prompted other students to come forward about Tokosh and their frustration with the university
Bradley Price took an online class with Tokosh and said the professor required students to photograph themselves with their faces painted
 Price said Tokosh told them the assignment was to help them understand Japanese culture, but then Tokosh offered him bonus points if he could get a female friend to paint her face
It seemed unusual at the time, Price said, because his friend wasn’t in the class
 It became more concerning to him on reading the student newspaper’s report
“I feel frankly disgusted and disappointed that Nicholls couldn’t do a proper background check on this professor, because this is unacceptable,” Price said
 Bella Ramos, a junior at Nicholls State who did not take any of Tokosh’s classes, told USA TODAY that someone using the handle @Joeography21 followed her on Twitter in late 2021 and started liking all her selfies
Ramos learned that the person behind the account was likely a professor at the university
 She posted about the behavior in January 2022, but nothing came of it
 She also found the Joeography Reddit account
 On March 27, the same day the student newspaper published its piece, Ramos posted screenshots of her discoveries on Twitter with the message, “Found a Nicholls state university professor on Reddit
”“I wish the university had acted sooner because all this information was public on the internet,” she told USA TODAY
 No one from the university, she said, has ever reached out

The moderators of the Republican primary debate expect some sparks to fly at the Reagan Library when candidates try to prove they’re the best one to take on former President Donald Trump
“All of them will be looking for a breakout moment or multiple moments,” Fox Business anchor Stuart Varney said
 “This is a very good chance for them to stand out and establish momentum ahead of the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary
”Fox News anchor Dana Perino, who will join Varney and Univision anchor Ilia Calderón at the moderators’ table, stressed the importance of Wednesday’s event at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum in Simi Valley
 The debate will be televised live at 6 p
m
 Pacific on Fox Business Network and Univision
 It will also stream on Rumble, the right-leaning, video-sharing platform
“This debate is where the rubber meets the road," Perino said
 "One of them has to show they can be the main rival to Trump
”The six candidates who have qualified so far for the debate are Florida Gov
 Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former Vice President Mike Pence, South Carolina Sen
 Tim Scott, former South Carolina Gov
 Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Gov
 Chris Christie
 Two other candidates — Arkansas Gov
 Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Gov
 Doug Burgum — have until Monday to meet the GOP requirements to participate
Trump announced last week that he did not plan to join the debate stage
“Nikki Haley benefitted the most from the first debate,” Perino said, referring to the Milwaukee GOP event in August
 But she added that it remains to be seen who will be the main rival for Trump, the frontrunner who wasn’t in Milwaukee and won’t be in Simi Valley
Varney said he will encourage a robust debate among the candidates at the Reagan Library
“I will look for questions directed to a specific candidate, knowing that another candidate has an opposing point of view," he said
Each candidate gets 60 seconds to answer a moderator’s question, Varney said
 If a candidate criticizes an opponent, the other candidate gets 30 seconds to respond, which is when Varney expects some sparks to fly
When asked about the likelihood of candidates talking over each other, Varney said, “We have a very loud buzzer
 It’s up to us to retain control
 The audience does not want a free-for-all
”Varney said the Fox Business Network research department will watch for any factual mistakes by the candidates and report them to the moderators through their earpieces
 But he added he expects the candidates will correct each other
Although the debate will air on Fox Business Network, Varney said the questions won’t be limited to the economy
“Far from it,” Varney said
 “People who watch this debate want to know where the candidates stand on other issues: immigration, crime, China and Ukraine
“And we’ll throw in a few surprise questions,” he said
Perino said the economy will influence various issues
“An example would be that many candidates believe, as Ronald Reagan, did in a strong national defense
 You need a strong economy for a strong national defense or to fight crime or for a good education,” she said
Varney, who along with Perino isn’t revealing any questions in advance, said he wouldn’t be surprised if Trump and his four indictments or the indictment of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, is discussed
And the symbolism of the debate site — the Reagan Library — isn’t lost on either moderator
“The candidates want to have the Reagan reputation placed on themselves
 I wonder if they can do it,” said Varney, a 75-year-old native of Derby, England and graduate of the London School of Economics
He pointed to the difference between Reagan and candidates such as Trump
“Reagan was not a populist
 He was a classic conservative — low-tax, low-regulation,” said Varney, who hosted programs on CNN and CNBC before joining the Fox News business team in 2004
“I remember watching Reagan debating Jimmy Carter in 1980,” Varney said
 “He asked (of viewers), ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago?’ That was a winning moment
”Perino said she has done a couple book signings at the Reagan Library and has participated in the library’s annual Reagan National Defense Forum
 “I love it there
”Wednesday will mark the first time Perino has been a moderator of a presidential debate, and she said she has picked up some tips from Fox News anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, who moderated the debate in Milwaukee
“I have to remind myself there’s a team to help me, from excellent researchers to the folks in wardrobe,” Perino said
 “I’m not doing it alone
”The 51-year-old Evanston, Wyoming native, grew up in Denver, where her father encouraged her to read the Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News
 “He had me choose two articles each day to discuss with him
”After various reporting jobs in broadcasting, Perino worked her way up from spokesperson at the U
S
 Department of Justice Department to press secretary for President George W
 Bush
Perino said Bush praised her for briefing him so well before press conferences that he was never surprised by any of the reporters’ questions
“It was the honor of a lifetime,” Perino said about her White House job

WASHINGTON − Democratic Sen
 Bob Menendez said Monday he expects to be exonerated and will remain as New Jersey's senior senator after the southern district of New York indicted the New Jersey lawmaker Friday alleging charges of corruption and bribery
Menendez said during a news conference in Union City, New Jersey, that those who have called for his resignation have based judgements off a "limited set of facts
""I understand how deeply concerning this could be, however the allegations leveled against me are just that, allegations," he said
Menendez addressed each of the charges listed in the indictment that allege he and his wife accepted bribes of cash, gold, mortgage payments and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for enriching the Egyptian government
"I firmly believe that when all of the facts are presented, not only will I be exonerated, but I still will be New Jersey's senior senator," he said
The New Jersey lawmaker reiterated his record with Egypt and said he has held the country accountable for human rights abuses, repression of its citizens and more
Menendez allegedly passed along "highly sensitive" information about staffers at the U
S
 Embassy in Cairo, according to the indictment
 Menendez also exerted "substantial influence" over military financing to Egypt, according to the indictment
In regard to the hundreds of thousands of dollars FBI agents found when executing a search warrant at his home, Menendez said he often withdraws thousands of dollars of cash from his personal savings account to keep for emergencies
Having stepped down as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after being indicted, he said he plans to return to Washington this week to work with his colleagues to avert a looming government shutdown
"For those who have rushed to judgment, you have done so based on a limited set of facts, framed by the prosecution to be as salacious as possible
 Remember, prosecutors get it wrong sometimes
 Sadly, I know that," he said during the news conference
Menendez is also accused of interfering with a New Jersey attorney general’s investigation of a relative of a New Jersey businessman, who is a co-defendant in the indictment, as well as attempting to influence the federal prosecution of another Garden State businessman, another co-defendant
 Friday's indictment marks the second time in 10 years the New Jersey lawmaker has been indicted
The New Jersey lawmaker was previously indicted in 2015 when prosecutors alleged he used his office to benefit a Florida eye doctor in exchange for nearly $1 million in gifts and campaign contributions
 Menendez repeatedly defended himself and said he did nothing wrong
 He faced 14 criminal counts, including eight counts of bribery
Menendez was later cleared of the criminal charges three years later after the Justice Department asked a federal court to dismiss the 2015 indictment
While calls for him to resign have grown, Menendez has remained defiant, denying the indictment’s allegations and saying in a statement last week he is “not going anywhere
”Almost all of New Jersey’s Democratic House delegation has publicly called on Menendez to step down, including Donald Norcross, Josh Gottheimer, Frank Pallone, Bill Pascrell and Mikie Sherrill, along with Gov
 Phil Murphy
Rep
 Andy Kim, D-N
J
, has announced he will be challenging the sitting senator in the New Jersey Senate race
 Sen
 John Fetterman, D-Pa
, has also called for Menendez to resign

 Gov
 Ron DeSantis continues to drop in the polls
 Now the second GOP presidential primary debate is approaching on Wednesday, and a big question is whether it even matters
Is there anything DeSantis can do at this point to change the dynamic in a race where former President Donald Trump's lead grows more daunting with each new poll?Many Republicans thought DeSantis did well in the first debate
 A poll of GOP debate watchers showed DeSantis was viewed as one of the winners
It didn't matter
 Trump has continued to expand his lead,A Quinnipiac University survey released Sept
 13 had Trump up by 50 percentage points nationally, an incredible margin
"The red lights are flashing, the wagons are circled, there’s trouble in River City," said Quinnipiac polling analyst Tim Malloy
Quinnipiac showed a much closer race in February, with DeSantis at 36% support and Trump at 42%
 The pollster's latest survey shows just 12% of GOP voters back DeSantis
“To put it bluntly, he’s dropping like a rock," Malloy said
DeSantis has struggled since formally entering the presidential race in May during a glitch-filled announcement on X, the platform formally known as Twitter
 He has fired campaign staff amid concerns about overspending and switched campaign managers
With his campaign in turmoil, there was intense pressure on DeSantis to deliver a strong performance during the first GOP presidential debate last month
 The governor didn't generate much buzz during the event in Milwaukee, avoiding mixing it up with the other candidates, but a survey released after the event by the Washington Post, FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos found that a plurality of GOP voters thought DeSantis won
Regardless, DeSantis' poll numbers haven't improved and multiple recent surveys show Trump strengthening his position in the race
Emerson College released a national poll Wednesday that had Trump beating DeSantis by 47 percentage points, the largest margin in more than a year of Emerson polling the race
DeSantis is at 12% support in the latest Emerson poll, compared to 29% in January
"Probably most concerning is that 12% has been stagnant for the better part of a month," said Spencer Kimball, executive director of the Emerson College Polling Center
 "August and September have seen him pre-debate and post debate sitting on that
"Kimball said it's not clear a good debate performance would significantly benefit DeSantis, or any other candidate, at this point because Trump's support is so strong, but a bad performance could knock him out of second place
“The rest of the field is starting to pull into DeSantis, the concern for DeSantis is that a bad debate performance would drop him," Kimball said
DeSantis has shrugged off his bad national polling numbers, noting that the primary process plays out at the state level
“We don’t have a national primary and if we had a national primary we would have a different approach, it’s a state by state process," DeSantis said recently on Fox Business
 "Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first opening salvos and I can tell you those are much different pictures on the ground there than what some of the national narrative is
"Yet Trump still holds a commanding lead in Iowa, where DeSantis only is doing slightly better than he is nationally
Emerson's latest survey has DeSantis down by 35 percentage points in Iowa
“Trump’s got a strong lead in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina," Kimball said of the first three states to vote
DeSantis' New Hampshire campaign is looking particularly weak, with the University of New Hampshire/CNN releasing a poll Wednesday that had Florida's governor in fifth place behind Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley and Chris Christie
 The headline of the news release accompanying the poll: "Trump leads, DeSantis Crashes in NH GOP Primary
"DeSantis led Trump by 12 percentage points in a January poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire
"The cultural campaign he has been waging simply doesn't resonate with New Hampshire Republicans," Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, told the Washington Examiner
 "I am still surprised he's pushing anti-woke rhetoric in New Hampshire
"In addition to the polling data, there are other warning signs for DeSantis' campaign
Ken Griffin, a billionaire who was DeSantis' second largest donor when he ran for re-election as governor last year, said in a recent CNBC interview that he is "still on the sidelines as to who to support in this election cycle
" Griffin isn't supporting DeSantis at this point
“I don’t know his strategy,” Griffin said of DeSantis
 “It’s not clear to me what voter base he is intending to appeal to
”DeSantis has tried to challenge Trump from the right and appeal to the most conservative elements of the GOP
 After initially trying to run a national campaign, he has retrenched and devoted much of his time and resources to campaigning in Iowa, which has a large base of conservative, Evangelical voters
DeSantis is hoping to use Iowa as a springboard, and is highlighting issues such his support for a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy as he tries to appeal to Iowa conservatives
Yet Kimball noted that Emerson's polling shows that Iowa voters who care most about the abortion issue and would like to see a complete ban still favor Trump, who recently attracted attention for calling DeSantis' six-week abortion ban a "terrible thing
""On the abortion issue, the data doesn’t suggest that’s going to move enough votes," Kimball said
University of Iowa Political Science Professor Tim Hagle believes DeSantis likely is doing better in Iowa than the polls suggest
 The state is difficult to poll because of its caucus system, he said, and DeSantis is investing enormous resources to ensure voters turn out to caucus for him
“DeSantis is doing the groundwork that we usually like to see in Iowa for the caucuses," Hagle said
Hagle also noted that polling tends to shift in Iowa as the caucus gets closer, and he believes Trump's abortion comments could hurt him with evangelicals
 Then there's Gov
 Kim Reynolds, who is weighing endorsing DeSantis, according to a recent Bloomberg article
Reynolds' backing would be a big win for DeSantis, who could tap into her extensive political network in the state
 It also would signal that she believes he had a good chance of winning the state
“With Reynolds, she won very handily back in November for re-election and seems to be very popular in the state and has a good campaign organization," Hagle said
 "If she could put that to work for DeSantis that’s going to give DeSantis


 a boost
”Despite his struggles, DeSantis still is viewed as the main alternative to Trump, Kimball noted
 Additionally, there still is a considerable amount of time to campaign before the Iowa caucus on Jan
 15 and Trump's legal troubles are a big wild card in the race
“There’s a lot of golf to play here and there’s a hurricane of controversy swirling around Trump," Malloy said
 "So far it hasn’t hurt him… you wonder what - if any - impact it will have
"DeSantis projected optimism during his Fox Business appearance
"We got a long way to go," he said
 "We’re going to work very, very hard
”Sen
 Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, is scheduled to have a press conference Monday at 11:30 a
m
 ET after he was indicted Friday by a federal grand jury in New York on corruption charges
Menendez and his wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, are accused of accepting bribes, including cash, gold, mortgage payments and a Mercedes-Benz in a case that alleges the senator used his foreign affairs influence for personal gain
Three New Jersey businessmen also were charged with showering the couple with expensive bribes in exchange for the senator’s dealings on their behalf
Menendez called the allegations baseless and a smear campaign
Menendez's indictment has led to heavy pressure from Democratic and Republican colleagues calling on him to resign
 Menendez said in a statement he is "not going anywhere
" After Menendez signaled his resistance to resign, Rep
 Andy Kim, D-N
J
, said he would mount a primary challenge against him

Contributing: Ken Tran and Michael Collins, USA TODAYWASHINGTON – Looking back on it, Philip Cohen takes a measure of pride in the fact that he was blocked by the former president of the United States
But in that moment in 2017, when Cohen pulled up Donald Trump's feed on what was then known as Twitter and realized what happened, he didn't feel smug or vindicated
He felt muted
"I was honestly shocked," said Cohen, a sociologist who was blocked after repeatedly posting criticism of Trump's tweets and who responded by suing the former president and claiming that the move violated the First Amendment
 Cohen said his snarky posts were like "carrying a sign at a protest – but with a much bigger audience
"Google it:Google faces off with the Justice Department in antitrust showdown: Here’s everything we knowThough the Supreme Court dodged Cohen's appeal in 2021, the justices now have another opportunity to decide whether public officials may block Americans on social media
 It's one of several cases pending at the high court with potentially enormous consequences for the way Americans interact on the internet
Legal experts say the Supreme Court term that begins next month could also be the most important in decades in determining the extent of the government's power to regulate the online content
At stake in one set of cases is whether the First Amendment shields social media platforms for their handling of controversial voices and views
 The question is critical as Facebook, YouTube and X play an ever growing role in the lives of Americans and democracy
 Yet another case questions whether the Biden administration crossed a line when officials pressured the platforms to remove posts dealing with COVID-19 and elections
The lawsuits are arriving against the backdrop of a raging partisan debate about how social media handles political content and misinformation
 If the Supreme Court decides all of the cases, the opinions could have profound implications for social media and politics − with decisions landing in the middle of next year's election
“One of the most important themes of the term will be the Supreme Court having to deal with the internet and social media more than ever before,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of Berkeley Law
Topping the list are two cases involving controversial laws in Florida and Texas that would radically limit what content social media companies can police on their platforms
 The Supreme Court could decide as early as next week whether to consider them
Spurred by the decisions by social media to ban Trump after the Jan
 6 attack on the Capitol, the laws arose out of long-running perceptions of political favoritism for liberal voices and views by Silicon Valley tech companies
 The states say their laws are meant to ensure the platforms provide "equal access to the public
""There is a dangerous movement by some social media companies to silence conservative ideas and values," Texas Gov
 Greg Abbott, a Republican, said when he signed the law in 2021
 "This is wrong and we will not allow it in Texas
"Florida Gov
 Ron DeSantis who is running for the GOP presidential nomination, made similar remarks, saying the law he signed that same year "guaranteed protection against the Silicon Valley elites
” He also said he knew the law would be challenged and that the Supreme Court would ultimately have to decide its constitutionality
Two trade groups representing the interests of internet companies reject that conservative narrative, arguing the state laws would upend social media and drive away users by flooding platforms with an uncontrollable wave of toxic sludge
"Normal people do not want to go on websites and just see a ton of lawful but awful content," said Chris Marchese, who oversees litigation for NetChoice
Matt Schruers, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, framed the potential outcome as "nothing less than a digital service’s ability to decide what content is appropriate for their community and their ability to protect their community from dangerous actors online
”"The solution to the problem is not to say 'no viewpoint discrimination,'" Schruers said
 "Because sympathizing with the Taliban is a viewpoint
 Nazis, that's a viewpoint
 Telling kids that detergent pods are tasty, that's a viewpoint
"The Supreme Court, which itself has no social media presence, will decide two cases dealing with whether public officials may block voters from posting criticism on their pages
 In one, members of a Southern California school board blocked what they described as “spam,” but what parents said were examples of “engagement
"In a related case, the city manager of Port Huron, Michigan, blocked residents from his Facebook page, including one who claimed in a post that city leaders were eating at a "pricey" restaurant during the COVID-19 pandemic
 The Supreme Court will hear arguments over the blocked users in November
Taken together, experts say the social media cases could lead to the high court having its biggest impact on the internet since 1997, when a unanimous court struck down an online indecency law and put First Amendment protection for online speech on par with other mediums, such as newspapers and television
“The term has the potential to be a referendum about the relationship between government and social media,” said Alex Abdo, litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which represented Cohen and other plaintiffs in their suit against Trump
"These cases, depending on how they're decided, could really reshape speech on the internet," said Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor
Another case, now pending on the Supreme Court's emergency docket, deals with just how far government officials may go to lean on social media companies to take down content they believe is inaccurate or dangerous
The Biden administration filed an appeal last week asking the Supreme Court to block a lower court ruling that found the White House, health officials and the FBI may have violated the First Amendment rights of people posting about COVID-19 and elections by pressuring tech companies to suppress or remove the posts
The lawsuit was filed by the Republican attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana as well as individuals who said their speech was censored
 The Supreme Court is likely to decide as soon as Friday on the immediate issue: whether to block the lower court's ruling while the underlying case continues
“This is really a blockbuster case that kind of comes out of nowhere because people weren’t paying that much attention to this issue,” said Anupam Chander, a visiting scholar at the Institute for Rebooting Social Media at Harvard University
 "Suddenly, the communications between the federal government and also state governments and internet platforms are being tested to see whether or not they are coercive
"The litigation has thrust the highly charged debate over social media onto the Supreme Court's docket, but experts say the cases will have ramifications far beyond culture war politics
City and state officials who use social media to solicit input on policies might get a skewed view if they block some users
 As social media increasingly becomes a conduit between elected officials and voters, the regulation of that communication could have unforeseen consequences for democracy
"This really affects us all," said Jennifer Safstrom, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School
 "It affects the scope, the rigor and the accessibility of conversations on an entire range of issues of public importance
"As a Republican and a Trump supporter, Gayla Baer-Taylor gets frustrated when her social media posts are taken down or she feels her reach is throttled
 The Indiana marketing professional and host of the podcast “No Left Turns” says she wants platforms to stop censoring people's political views
"I am not about suppressing anybody’s First Amendment rights," Baer-Taylor said
But the 56-year-old grandmother of nine says social media platforms also have a duty to shield users – especially children – from harmful and dangerous content like terrorism or Nazism
“I do think there has to be some moderation,” she said, “but I don’t know where we draw that line
”The iPhone 15 will be available beginning Friday
 It introduces new features including an upgraded camera and display, an action button and a move to kill off its Lightning charging cord and replace it with the universal standard USB-C
A similar switch in charging cables was made from the 30-pin connector to Lightning more than a decade ago, releasing a concern in customers that had already invested in cables and accessories
 Apple leadership made the decision to make the move to Lightning with the iPhone 5, but unlike that switch, USB-C is one of necessity
 European regulation requiring USB-C is set to take effect next year, in their effort to crack down on e-waste, they mandated a common charger for mobile devices by 2024
USB-C is not a new connector for consumers with tech
 Consumers charge all their gadgets with a USB-C connector, including iPads, MacBooks, gaming devices, headphones, etc
 Lighting is for iPhones and AirPods
 The move to USB-C will eventually cut out all previous versions of charging cables making it easy to carry around one cable and not many

iPhone 15 pro uses USB-C charger:An exploration of how Apple got hereCelebrations erupted in the NASA control room as the capsule containing samples from the asteroid Bennu touched down in the Utah desert Sunday after a 4 billion mile journey that lasted seven years
The capsule containing pieces from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu separated from the spacecraft known as the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer, or the OSIRIS-REx, and entered Earth's atmosphere
 The mission was the first U
S
 attempt to retrieve and analyze samples from an asteroid
OSIRIS-REx's van-sized craft visited Bennu, scraped and collected material from the asteroid’s surface, and sealed it into a 3-foot-wide container, equipped with a heat shield, called the Sample Return Capsule for delivery to Earth
The capsule parachuted into the Utah Test and Training Range in Utah's West Desert, about 80 miles west of Salt Lake City, at approximately 11 a
m
 EDT
Scientists recovered the sample from the landing, and the sample will be sent to the Johnson Space Center in Houston
Explained:How NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft brought Bennu asteroid sample back to EarthWill Bennu hit Earth?NASA projection, size, what to knowOSIRUS-REx is an unmanned, solar-powered spacecraft about the size of a household toolshed
 Five science instruments mapped Bennu's chemistry and mineralogy, to determine the effect of sunlight on the asteroid's orbit
The cost of the mission, excluding launch, is $800 million
A timeline of significant events:First discovered in 1999, Bennu is believed to be part of a larger asteroid that collided with another space rock
 It’s about one-third of a mile wide and is roughly the height of the Empire State Building, according to NASA
Its black surface is packed with boulders, and it orbits the sun every 14 months
Bennu is rich in carbon and is believed to be a leftover fragment from the birth of the solar system, 4
5 billion years ago, a time capsule of sorts that may help understand and trace the origin of life
The asteroid was named after an Egyptian deity in 2013 by a nine-year-old boy from North Carolina
 Bennu is the ancient Egyptian deity linked with the Sun, creation and rebirth
Bennu is being studied to better understand other asteroids and their movements through space
 Information gathered by OSIRIS-REx may help in development of future technologies to deflect asteroids that threaten to collide with Earth

comA group of U
 S
 citizens stolen from their birth mothers in Chile converged on the U
S
 capital Saturday to confront visiting Chilean President Gabriel Boric
They left with a promise
"How can I help?" Boric told Jimmy Lippert Thyden, an Ashburn, Virginia man who was taken from his mother in Chile as a baby and adopted out to unsuspecting parents in the U
S
 about 40 years ago
It was a major victory for Thyden and other stolen children, who have struggled for years to get the attention of Chile's government
It took a 5,000-mile trip to Washington, D
C
 for them to be heard
'I love you so much':Watch the moment Virginia man reunites with mom 42 years after he was stolen from ChileLeading Saturday's charge was Constanza del Río, founder and president of Nos Buscamos, a nonprofit working to reconnect adoptees with their birth families with the help of DNA tests from MyHeritage
Del Río has been trying to get a meeting with Boric since his election in March 2022
 She had been fighting for years to get the attention of presidents who preceded him
Frustrated with a lack of progress, she said she decided that her best bet would be to get Boric's attention when he spoke Saturday at a memorial event at the site of the car-bombing deaths of prominent Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier and 25-year-old Ronni Moffitt on Sept
 21, 1976
 The bombing was ordered by Chilean Gen
 Augusto Pinochet, who took power following a military coup three years earlier in what's now known as "the other 9/11
"Del Río and the Chilean adoptees didn't know what to expect from Saturday's event, but it certainly wasn't an invitation to meet with the president
 That's what they got
Upon arrival at the event, they were handed an invite to meet with Boric afterward, thanks to their cultivation of a relationship with Juan Gabriel Valdés, Chilean ambassador to the U
S
 A spokesman for Valdés said he is "close with the cause" and was happy to help
Del Río and two adoptees, including Thyden, spoke with Boric for about 10 minutes and left elated, speaking about the interaction first with USA TODAY just outside the Chilean embassy
Del Río handed Boric a letter calling on him to establish a government agency to help upwards of 20,000 people taken as babies from mostly low-income mothers and adopted by unsuspecting parents in foreign countries
The practice amounted to an elaborate human-trafficking operation that involved a network of midwives, doctors, social workers, nuns, priests and judges, many of whom got rich off the scheme while fulfilling a key goal of Pinochet's regime to make Chile an economic success
The scheme came to light in 2014, when an investigative news agency called CIPER wrote about some cases involving a priest and a doctor
 That’s also when the stolen babies, now adults, started learning that they weren’t voluntarily given up as they had always believed
"The time has come for the state of Chile to recognize the trafficking of children as a historical truth, just as they have with the crimes of the dictatorship," read the letter, which was signed by 50 of Chile's stolen children and calls on Boric to create an investigative agency dedicated to the issue under the country's Ministry of Justice
“I told him he has the opportunity to change people's lives," del Río said
 "People that are alive now who are victims of Pinochet and all the child trafficking that occurred in those years, and he was very interested and he was very emotional about that
 And he said, 'Yes, let's talk in Santiago
' 


 He said that he’s willing to do something
"Del Río is now set to meet with the Chilean Minister of Justice Luis Cordero Vega on Oct
 16
 After that, she expects a longer meeting with Boric
 And then action
“This is a dream come true,” she said as tears welled
 “It’s a promise
 I’m going to be on them until they do it
”USA TODAY has been writing about the stolen children of Chile since April, and that coverage has led at least 21 Americans who were adopted from the South American nation to find out the truth about their past, according to del Río
"Your stories have changed so many lives," she said Saturday
Boric's trip to Washington came about two weeks after the 50th anniversary of the U
S
-supported coup that put Pinochet in power in 1973
Now more than 30 years after Pinochet stepped down, Boric is working to address some of the atrocities of the regime
He recently announced that his government would launch a national search for more than 1,100 people who were disappeared during the regime and have never been found
"The only way to build a future that’s free and respectful of life and human dignity is to know the whole truth," he said in a statement announcing the search on Aug
 30
In Washington on Saturday, he honored Letelier and Moffitt at a ceremony in Sheridan Circle, the site of the 1976 bombing that took their lives and also sent a message from Pinochet to the rest of the world at the time: I am untouchable
"Orlando's and Ronni's ideals won and we are very proud of that," said Boric, who was born 10 years after the attack
The leftist former student protest leader and millennial ran on promises to tackle poverty and inequality and became Chile's youngest president at the age of 35
'The other 9/11':As US marks attack anniversary, another infamous milestone loomsCar-bombed in Washington:How a Chilean diplomat's death woke up the US to dictator's evilThyden said his talk with Boric was everything he wanted it to be
"It took him about five seconds to say, 'How can I help?'" Thyden said
 "That's all we wanted to hear
 And at this point, you know, it starts the conversation
 Now we have the foothold
"He said he told Boric about his own illegal adoption and said, "You can't make this right, but you can make it better
""We have taken a big step towards towards getting accountability for all the mamás that were robbed, all of the children that were robbed, and we're finally starting to build progress," said Thyden, who reunited with his own mother in August after he'd begun to question the truth about his past, prompted by one of USA TODAY's stories
The victory came as a bit of a shock to Rachel Smolka, who grew up in a loving adoptive home in Staten Island, New York and only recently found out she had been stolen as a baby from her birth mother
 (She had an emotional reunion with her mother in Chile in February
)"We didn't even know that (del Río) was going to be able to get the letter to (Boric), let alone meet with him," said Smolka, who traveled from New York to join the group hoping to get Boric's attention
 "It's amazing to me that she got Boric here and that she had to fly all the way from her own country to speak to her own president
"The stars aligned for this to happen

Workers may get respite from breathing the toxic dust that remains omnipresent in U
S
 mining operations, despite decades of evidence of its deadly consequences
The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration has proposed cutting by half the level at which miners may be exposed to silica dust stirred up during drilling for coal and other ores
 The new regulations align with exposure limits already in place in other job sectors
 The fine dust, crystalline silica, is a primary driver for harmful respiratory illnesses known as pneumoconioses, with symptoms that include scarring in the lungs and restricted lung capacity
 There is no cure for these diseases
Growing evidence indicates that silica dust contributes to black lung disease, or coal workers' pneumoconiosis, as well as its more deadly form, progressive massive fibrosis
New vaccinesAre COVID vaccine concerns impacting flu-shot rates? Here's what the data says
“Silica is actually quite toxic dust,” said Dr
 Leonard Go, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Chicago’s School of Public Health, who has studied silica’s effects on miners
 Despite silica being common in the earth’s crust, he said, “This is bad stuff, and it can cause quite severe disease
 It’s clear that, in the case of coal mining, the current regulation is not effective in preventing disease
” The federal rule would drastically limit silica dust permissible in mining to just 50 micrograms per cubic meter, with an action level at 25 micrograms, for an eight-hour workday
 That's the equivalent of a tiny, short strand of hair appearing once a day, in fine dust form, within the space of a cardboard box, Go estimated
Notably, the rule would also require, for the first time, that workers mining metal, nonmetal, stone, sand and gravel receive early and ongoing health screenings at no cost
 Coal miners have had mandatory on-site screenings, check ups and X-rays since Congress passed the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which established the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program
 The public comment period for the new rule ended in mid-September, and a final rule is expected to be issued later this fall
For years, regulators and labor groups have kept an eye on breathing hazards for coal miners
 The new rule will likely benefit coal miners in Central Appalachia, where more than a fifth of long-tenured workers are estimated to have pneumoconiosis
 But coal workers now make up a declining share of the workforce, about 55,000 people nationwide, compared with nearly 200,0000 metal, nonmetal, stone, sand and gravel workers, who operate in what has been until now a far less regulated sector
The harms of silica have been known since at least the 1930s, when the Department of Labor led a campaign to “Stop Silicosis,” a pneumoconiosis associated with inhaling silica dust
Decades later, in the late '60s, the federal government began regulating coal dust, prompted by concerns about the prevalence of black lung disease among coal miners
 From that period through the 1990s, doctors saw a steep decline in the disease
 Now a growing body of evidence shows an increase in silica dust across U
S
 mining operations, which has contributed to miners becoming more ill and even exacerbating cases of black lung in recent decades
 Academic experts and regulators attribute the increase in severe black lung in younger workers to thinner coal seams as workers drill through more layers of rock containing silica
 At the same time, advances in technology mean workers handle heavier machinery that kicks up more dust than older miners, who often relied on hand tools
Former coal miner Leonard Fleming, 81, of Whitesburg, Kentucky, has a severe form of black lung disease
 He relies on a myriad of medical devices to help his breathing, including various portable oxygen tanks, a nebulizer that mists liquid and a vest to dislodge mucus
 He no longer takes warm showers
 He estimates he can take about 20 steps before he has to stop to huff for air
Environmental justiceResidents of Cancer Alley sue Louisiana parish officials over civil rights, religious liberty violationsFleming’s grandfather and father had black lung
 After serving in the Army, Fleming saw its effects as a 24-year-old lab assistant in a coal miners’ hospital, wearing a white lab coat and dress pants, conducting pulmonary function tests
 Eventually, he turned to the mines like his family members had before him, for the wages, which supported his late wife, Norma, and their two children, who never worked in the mines
“Anybody that goes in the mines just assumes they’re not going to get it,” Fleming said, wheezing as he talked
 “Just about all of them did
”Now that he's retired, Fleming said, he longs to watch the dirt track car racing or baseball games, but his body can't handle the exertion
What he's lived through is now better understood
In a 2022 study in Annals of the American Thoracic, Go and other researchers viewed tissue samples from 85 deceased coal miners born before and after 1930, in many cases from people who lived through the implementation of federal regulations on coal dust levels
 The samples indicated that people who'd mined in recent years had higher concentrations of silica in their lungs and endured severe lung disease, often at earlier ages than the previous generations of miners who showed severe disease that tended to be derived from coal dust
These findings square with the 2020 review of the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which showed a resurgence in pneumoconiosis and progressive massive fibrosis, especially in Appalachia
Dr
 Noemi Hall, a research epidemiologist at NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division in Morgantown, West Virginia, said miners are contracting more severe forms of disease in their 30s and 40s
Silica dust, she explained, can break down into even smaller pieces and lodge itself permanently in the lungs
“These miners can’t get rid of it,” she said
 “Once it goes in there, it stays in there
” Inside the lungs, it causes inflammation and scarring that results in a limited capacity to take in oxygen
 Symptoms include coughing, fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain
 Workers who develop pneumoconiosis are also at greater risk of issues such as tuberculosis, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD
Concerns about silica dust arose long before the 21st century
 In fact, in 1974, NIOSH recommended cutting silica dust levels, just five years after the federal law regulating coal and its effects on miners
 Labor advocates attribute the delay in addressing the danger to the aggressive lobbying by coal companies and other industries, which centered on denying silica’s harm on the body
The official consensus seems to have shifted across the industry
 Christopher Williamson, assistant secretary for the Mine Safety and Health Administration, said the consensus is that miners should have the same protection as other workers with silica dust
 Other occupations, such as construction, where workers are exposed to greater quantities of silica, are already covered under Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards implemented in 2016
“The timing is right to move forward on it,” Williamson, whose West Virginia family members worked in coal mines and developed black lung, told USA TODAY
 “We know that miners need greater levels of protection from exposure to this toxic dust, and that’s why we’ve proposed it
”The National Mining Association, which represents mining companies, supports lower silica exposure levels, but it took issue with proposals that called for respirators, or personal protective equipment
 The rule under consideration uses respirators as a temporary supplemental measure when silica levels are high
Paul Krivokuca, vice president for health and safety at the National Mining Association, wrote in final comments there were some "times and places where use of PPE is the best way to protect miners when other measures have proven unable to reduce personal exposure
"Go, of the University of Illinois Chicago, said he thinks masking against dust is the least effective means of protection, and it can cause communication problems in the workplace
 Preventing dust from being in the atmosphere, whether by watering it down or through better ventilation, is safer, he said
Officials from the United Mine Workers of America told federal regulators they were concerned about enforcement of the rule by mine operators, who are currently expected to conduct sampling of exposure levels but don't always do so
 The union told federal officials in final comment the rule is “vulnerable to being gamed
”“This would be like each driver on a highway being responsible for reporting their own violations of law,” union President Cecil Roberts said
“We know that would never work,” he said
 “You need a number of things in order to protect miners
 You need good laws
 You need those laws to be obeyed and, if they're not obeyed, you need good enforcement
”At Temple University Medical Center, in Philadelphia, Dr
 Jamie Garfield, a professor of thoracic medicine and surgery, sees miners who travel into the city for lung transplant evaluations, at late stages in the disease
 The new rule could reduce that risk, she said
“Anytime that we can identify a condition that is completely avoidable with better surveillance, oversight and protection,” she said, “that is an opportunity for a major public health triumph

Residents of Lahaina will be allowed to return to their homes for the first time since deadly wildfires swept across the island town in August
The first zone was opened for re-entry on Monday, clearing residents and business owners who apply for vehicle passes to drive back into town
 The Maui Emergency Management Agency will provide up to four passes for each residence, two for the owner and two for the resident, according to a news release
Those who return will be provided personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as "water, shade, washing stations, portable toilets, medical and mental health care, Maui Bus transportation from local hotel shelters and language assistance
""Most important is getting that closure," Darryl Oliveira, interim administrator of the Maui Emergency Management Agency, said during a news conference last week
 "For many of them that left in the midst of the fire, this is going to be the first opportunity to go back and really see what's left
"Authorities cautioned that the area is still covered in ash and debris from the fire, and residents could encounter roadside hazards, including burned vehicles
 PPE kits issued to residents will include an air respirator to prevent breathing in particles from the ash
Officials also advised against digging through the ground, due to metal and concrete remnants
"Again, our goal is to just support what needs to be done when people get closure and helping them to grieve and get through this process before we move into the next process, which is actually the debris removal," Oliveira said
 "So we'll work with the community, just asking for everyone's patience, understanding, and really the cooperation
"More:Is US migrant surge result of 'a broken and failed system?'The devastating fire burned across approximately 2,170 acres, or 3
4 square miles, according to the County of Maui
 The blaze left at least 97 dead, a number revised down from an initial death toll of 115 on Sept
 15, the Associated Press reported
A wildfire emergency proclamation signed by Hawaii Gov
 Josh Green earlier this month will allow tourists to return to most of West Maui starting on Oct
 8
 The proclamation underscores the difficult balance between prioritizing recovery and the island's economy
 Officials initially advised tourists not to travel to the fire-ravaged island to prioritize Maui residents, but later announced the island would re-open to visitors sooner in an effort to revive the island's tourism-dependent economy
Some Lahaina residents feel that the Oct
 8 re-opening is too soon to allow the town to heal
 A petition demanding that Green and Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen delay the date has collected more than 7,200 signatures
 "We firmly believe that before any reopening takes place, it is imperative to consult with and prioritize the needs of these working-class Lāhainā residents," it reads
Late last month, the search and rescue phase ended in order for the Environmental Protection Agency to move into an effort to remove any hazardous material and prepare the area for re-entry in cooperation with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U
S
 Army Corps of Engineers
“No one in our state has ever experienced the magnitude of this disaster and the degree of tragedy, therefore as we move through it, coordination with all county, state and federal agencies are occurring daily with my team," Bissen said at the time

"So that should be a day of spectacular dumbness
On Thursday, House Republicans will ignore a looming government shutdown and hold their first impeachment inquiry hearing against President Joe Biden
 They want to impeach the president for … things? Nobody is quite sure because, despite months of investigations, Republican lawmakers have failed to show the American people a single piece of evidence that would suggest Biden is impeachment-worthy
 His son, Hunter Biden, might be impeachment-worthy, but, inconveniently, he’s not president
Conspiracy world:GOP's Hunter Biden hysteria makes even less sense after plea deal gets put on holdThe hearing will be a big tent shy of a circus, and one can expect the post-hearing blabbering from VCRs (very concerned Republicans) to include Olympic-size leaps to conclusions and enough random-dot connecting to wipe out a phalanx of fact-checkers
Don’t worry, things will get dumber yet
Government shutdown isn't inevitable
It's a choice – a dumb one
The deadline for Congress to pass a government funding bill is Saturday night, and Republican lawmakers in the House are preoccupied with infighting led by hardcore MAGA folks eager to watch the world burn
 With little progress made over the weekend, there’s a good chance Republicans will stubborn their way to a government shutdown by week’s end
GOP actually work?House Republicans as government shutdown nears: Nobody told us we'd have to governCheering for that conclusion, of course, is Trump, who wants to take a principled stand on fiscal responsibility
HAH! I made that last part up
 Trump wouldn’t know a principle if it paddled him with a rolled up Forbes magazine
 He wants the government to shut down because he thinks – incorrectly – it would halt the various legal cases he’s facing
You know, the legal cases all his presidential primary opponents refuse to highlight as the key reasons he should not be the GOP's nominee?Collectively, that is a veritable tsunami of stupidity so overwhelming it deserves a recap:A bunch of GOP presidential candidates who have no shot at the nomination because they only timidly criticize Trump out of fear of alienating his supporters will babble onstage at a library named after one of the Republican Party’s most-revered figures, Reagan, a man who would undoubtedly loathe most of them and would be particularly disgusted by Trump himself
While they’re doing that, Trump will lie to a select group of supportive auto workers who somehow see a rich lifetime con artist eyeball deep in legal trouble as a sensible choice for commander in chief
The next day, Trump’s lackeys in Congress will embarrass themselves by spewing a vivid collection of conspiracy theories and innuendos that allege Biden is both a global criminal mastermind and a doddering old fool who should be hauled off to Guantanamo while we wait on evidence to prove whatever it is this collection of right-wing sycophants are alleging
And then, almost certainly, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his out-of-control caucus will find a way to marry their dislike for governing with their inestimable skill at doing exactly the wrong thing and cause a wholly avoidable government shutdown
While all this is happening, most Americans will be living their lives and worrying about things that matter, like jobs and health care and education and the cost of food and whatnot
Democrats have actually been doing things to address those concerns, from the Inflation Reduction Act to Biden’s infrastructure bill, and while Republicans are having their week of living ludicrously, Biden – an actual pro-union president – will meet striking workers on the picket line
 So a reasonable question to ask as this week unfolds is: Which side is making sense here? Which side has at least one foot, or maybe even both, in reality, and which side is flailing nonsensically in service to a loudmouth whose only concern is himself?We’ll see
 Maybe the Republicans will surprise us
HAH! I made that last part up as well
 This week will be shambolic
 And for anyone paying attention, that should matter

com/RexIsAJerkEach time Matt Wos passes by his local police station near downtown Chicago, he can't believe seeing the dozens of migrants surrounding it seeking shelter
 Wos takes in the rows of people sleeping on the floors inside, a young mother placing her infant inside a crib outside, the migrants lining up the street in the nation's third-largest city, and he wonders: how long can this go on, especially as the weather starts to get colder?"I'm all about us being a 'Welcoming city,' and such as this makes me think how bad it can be for them in Venezuela or wherever they come from to come here," said Wos, a longtime accountant
 "But it also looks like what we're currently doing to help them doesn't seem to be working
" Halfway across the country in San Diego, County Supervisor Jim Desmond said about 4,800 migrants have been dropped off there in the past week
 The sudden migrant surge has led to Border Patrol suspending pedestrian crossing at a facility in San Ysidro, California, so local authorities can assist, he said
 "It's inhumane, it's not fair to those arriving here and to those who live in neighborhoods nearby," said Desmond, a Republican
 "This is a broken and failed system by the federal government
"Meanwhile, anti-migrant activists in Chicago, New York and Massachusetts have gathered in recent weeks to protest against more migrants arriving and needing help in their communities
From Staten Island to Chicago to San Diego and other points in between, some Americans are getting frustrated with migrants arriving in their neighborhoods with few shelter and assistance options for them
 Many said they want the federal government and local officials to do more to provide help to those who need it and find a better solution for future migrants hoping to enter the U
S
The concern has been building, with the U
S
 seeing high levels of illegal crossings in recent years after the COVID-19 pandemic kept many migrants from entering the country in 2020
 The latest wave of migrants means more people arriving in cities across the U
S
, looking for a place to sleep at bus stops, outside airports and city halls
"It's wildly frustrating," said Chicago Alderman Raymond Lopez, noting that Chicago has received more than 13,000 migrant asylum seekers, and counting, since August 2022
 "There seems to be no end in sight
"In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams has said the large influx of migrants since 2022, more than 110,000 and counting arriving from the U
S
-Mexico border, will "destroy" his city
 With more than 60,000 migrants still in the city's care, according to the Department of Social Services, Adams blames a lack of federal aid and Republican Govs
 Greg Abbott in Texas and Ron DeSantis in Florida, who's also a GOP presidential candidate, for sending asylum seekers to northern states in recent months and causing a crisis
"We're getting no support on this national crisis," said Adams, a Democrat, during a town hall
Other city officials have said shelters and other resources are at capacity as many new arrivals are forced to sleep on the streets
 Many blame the Biden administration for not taking a stronger approach to U
S
 immigration policy
"It's not just New York going through this," said Desmond
 "It's chaos the way the federal government is just dropping off thousands of people in this county that is getting no coordinated help or aid
"This is not just a Democrat issue, not just a Republican issue," Desmond said
 "This is a national issue
" Lopez, the Chicago alderman, a Democrat, also wants to see fewer migrants arriving in his community
 "Every week, the city of Chicago sees new arrivals by bus or by plane, it's a slow and steady march with no real action from Washington," Lopez said
The Biden administration said Tuesday it would send 800 active-duty military personnel to help the 2,500 National Guard members deployed to assist Border Patrol agents at the U
S
-Mexico border
On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said it would grant Temporary Protected Status to an estimated 472,000 Venezuelans in the U
S
 as of July 31 to help ease a path to work authorization
 That move is in addition to nearly 243,000 Venezuelans already qualified for the temporary status
But that may do little help in Eagle Pass, Texas, where Mayor Rolando Salinas said about 2,000 migrants had crossed the border Thursday after officials shut down one of the city's two international bridges to reroute agents elsewhere
 About 9,000 asylum-seekers have crossed from Mexico within the last week
The bridge shutdown in Eagle Pass came after the city declared an emergency declaration Tuesday because of a "severe undocumented immigrant surge
" The mayor said the order was issued to give the town "the ability to request financial resources to provide the additional services caused by the influx of the undocumented immigrants," Salinas said in a press release
The following day, Abbott, the Texas governor, declared an "invasion" at the state’s border with Mexico
Salinas said he fears more large migrant groups were going to arrive over the weekend
 On Thursday, the Eagle Pass mayor told CNN that Biden should take some blame for the surge of migrants into his town
"I will be honest with you
 I believe 100% he does bear some responsibility for this crisis," Salinas said
 "I haven’t heard from anybody in the administration
 The president hasn’t put out a statement, the vice president, I haven’t heard from anybody
"Meanwhile in El Paso, Texas, about seven hours to the east of Eagle Pass, the city is entering its "fourth wave" of migrant surges since 2018, according to Laura Cruz-Acosta, an El Paso city spokeswoman
The city has received more than 1,800 migrants a day crossing the border in the past week, the first major surge since the expiration in May of Title 42, a COVID-19 pandemic policy that allowed the U
S
 to cite fears of spreading the virus as a reason to expel migrants
"It's putting a strain on our city," Acosta-Cruz said
 "It is concerning that we're seeing this ramp up very quickly
"El Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser told reporters on Saturday "We have come to what we look at (as) a breaking point right now
"Acosta-Cruz said what's occurring in El Paso mirrors other border cities
 Arrests at the U
S
-Mexico border increased in July and August after an initial sharp decline in May and June after the Biden administration launched a new policy requiring migrants heading to the U
S
 border to first seek protection in Mexico
 Biden adopted the rule after Title 42's expiration
But many migrants, many arriving from Venezuela, aren't waiting for various reasons
 "The type of migrant we see now are those who are leaving their communities they call home for humanitarian reasons, because of violence, poverty, political reasons economic and to try escaping human trafficking," Acosta-Cruz said
Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens told ABC News in an interview that aired Sunday the Mexican drug cartels are flooding the U
S
 border with illegal immigrants in part as a distraction so they can smuggle drugs, criminals and weapons into the country
"In terms of flow and the threats that we’re seeing with fentanyl and with the criminal organizations that are our adversary, it’s about as bad as I’ve ever seen it," Owens said
 "This isn’t sustainable
 This is up-and-down the system, everybody is overwhelmed
 Even the government of Mexico, which have been great partners for us, the U
S
 Border Patrol, a lot of times our facilities are already over capacity
"On Friday, Mexican officials pledged to set up checkpoints to "depressurize" migrants from hopping freight trains from its northern cities which border El Paso, San Diego and Eagle Pass
Acosta-Cruz, the El Paso city official, adds from what she's seen, a lot of migrants are being "misled by the cartels so really it's a lot of misinformation being shared with the migrants
 They have this understanding they can just come in and flow through, but that's not the case
"There are currently about 1,000 migrants in nine hotels around town, with a recreation center ready to use, Acosta-Cruz said
 Because El Paso handles its fair share of migrants, some of whom stay anywhere from 24- to 72 hours before moving on, the city and El Paso County receive FEMA funding and work collaboratively with nonprofits, churches and other local businesses to handle matters
"The discussion that's happening nationally does not really paint a comprehensive picture of our city and how we are addressing it," Acosta-Cruz said
 "Our approach is very humane we are working as best as we can to address a terrible national crisis and meeting the needs of our community
"The migrant crisis in Chicago, however, continues to be a hotly contested matter, as evidenced during a tense Sept
 14 City Council meeting
While a majority of the council overwhelmingly approved accepting a $33 million grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be used for migrant spending, Lopez and three other aldermen voted against it, citing homeless and low-income residents in their wards cannot find affordable housing
"We're hearing more and more 'What are we doing for our Chicago residents as we are doing for our new arrivals?'" Lopez said
 "What about us?"  In June, prior to the president's visit to Chicago, Lopez wrote an open letter to Biden, encouraging him to tour overrun migrant camps in the city
 Lopez wrote that tens of thousands of migrants "have flooded our borders and been shipped like livestock across the country," and spread beyond the border towns and villages to cities like Chicago
The alderman said it's simply unreasonable to expect cities and states to either directly or indirectly provide for migrants' welfare
 Lopez urged Biden to visit a field house in a city park where summer camps were suspended to accommodate about 300 migrants for about three months
"They have allowed the border crisis to become our backyard crisis," Lopez said
 "I might not be towing the party line, but I'm towing the truth, those who believe in values truly believe what I am saying
" Kate Marengo, a fellow Chicagoan and small business owner, also wants the federal government to help find a solution to the many migrants arriving in Chicago
"If they secured the border properly, none of this would be happening," Marengo said
 "There are Americans who are really struggling
 We have to secure our oxygen masks first before we help others and America is bleeding right now
"Wos, the Chicago resident, is hopeful things will get better
 Recently elected Mayor Brandon Johnson has promised to place migrants sheltering at police stations in heated camps as they wait for spots in city-run shelters
"I take them at their word that there will be heated tents, but all of my friends think 'Is that going to be enough when it gets cold and with more migrants coming?'" Wos said
 "I don't think there is an easy answer to dealing with this issue
 We need to do more at the border
"An Italian Mafia boss who spent 30 years on the run before his capture earlier this year died on Monday, Italian media reported
Matteo Messina Denaro, 61, had colon cancer when he was arrested in January
 His condition worsened in recent months, and he was transferred to L’Aquila Hospital
 Denaro went into a coma on Friday and never regained consciousness, Italian outlet ANSA reported
"You shouldn't deny prayers to anyone, but I can't say I am sorry," Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said in a message on Instagram
Denaro, of the Cosa Nostra mob, had been convicted in absentia of several crimes including planning the murders of anti-Mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992, the Associated Press reported
 He was given multiple life sentences
Previously:Italy arrests Sicilian Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro after 30 years on the runThe ruthless and notorious Sicilian mafia-boss was dubbed the "last Godfather
" He was the last of three longtime fugitive top-level Mafia bosses who evaded capture for decades
Felia Allum, professor of comparative organized crime and corruption at the UK’s University of Bath told CNN that Denaro was the last of the old generation of mafia bosses
“He represents the final link between the belligerent and overt Cosa Nostra of the early 1990s and the silent, business-like Mafia of the 21st century,” Allum told CNN
His crimes included the kidnapping of a 12-year-old boy to stop his father from providing evidence against the mob, Reuters reported
 The kid was killed two years later
 He was also convicted of bombings in Rome, Florence and Milan in 1993
 He went into hiding that same year, after many turncoats began to reveal details of his involvement in the mob
A government official told Reuters that Denaro's body is expected to return to Sicily in the coming days for a private funeral

Lower your auto insurance costs: Find the best car insurance of 2023ROME — Film legend Sophia Loren is recovering from successful surgery for a leg fracture after she fell in her Switzerland home, an agent for the 89-year-old Italian actor said Monday
Agent Andrea Giusti said in an email that Loren fell in a bathroom on Sunday and the surgery was performed later that day
 The operation “went very well and now we only need to wait,” Giusti said
The actress broke both her hip and a thigh bone, the agent said
It wasn’t immediately clear when Loren would be discharged from the hospital
Loren's restaurant Instagram page also shared more about her recent health scare, noting that the actress "will now have to observe a short period of recovery and follow a road to rehabilitation
""The whole team at Sophia Loren Restaurant takes this opportunity to wish her a speedy recovery," the post concluded
Loren has lived in a Swiss villa near Lake Geneva for decades
 Earlier this month, she appeared, looking radiant, with Italian designer Giorgio Armani in Venice at a fashion show held on the sidelines of the city’s annual film festival
She celebrated her 89th birthday last week
 She was scheduled to appear at a restaurant that bears her name in Bari, a city in southern Italy, but her fall forced a cancellation of the event
 According to her agent, Loren gave the restaurant the right to use her name and image
The film legend is best known for her Oscar-winning role in the 1961 Italian film "Two Women" and for starring in movies "A Special Day," "Marriage Italian Style," "Grumpier Old Men" and "Arabesque
"‘The Life Ahead’:Sophia Loren’s most Oscar-worthy moments from her Netflix filmIn 2020, she returned to acting after a decade-long hiatus for the film "The Life Ahead
"Director Edoardo Ponti, Loren's son with producer Carlo Ponti, told USA TODAY at the time that the Italian actress jumped at the chance to portray the spirited Madame Rosa, a Holocaust survivor who scrapes together a living raising the children of fellow sex workers
 "She was waiting for a role that inspired her, challenged her and allowed her to bring out her most authentic self," Ponti said
