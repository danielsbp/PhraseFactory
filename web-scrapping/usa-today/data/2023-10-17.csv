When Angel Amankwaah traveled from Denver to North Carolina Central University for incoming student orientation this summer, she decided she had made the right choice. 
She had fun learning the chants that fans perform at football games. But she also saw that “there are students who look like me, and professors who look like me” at the historically Black university, said Amankwaah, 18, who is Black. “I knew that I was in a safe space.”
This has in the last two years become an important consideration for college-bound students from all backgrounds and beliefs. With so much attention focused on these issues, USA TODAY and The Hechinger Report present the first-of-its-kind College Welcome Guide showing state laws and institutional policies that affect college and university students, from bans on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and “critical race theory” to rules about guns on campus and whether student IDs are accepted as proof of residency for voting purposes.
The digital tables also list, for every four-year institution in the country, such things as racial and gender diversity among students and faculty, the number of student veterans enrolled, the incidence of on-campus race-motivated hate crimes, free-speech rankings and if the university or college serves many students from rural places.
College Welcome Guide: Test it yourself.These tools new offer a new on campus life
Students have long picked schools based on their academic reputations and social life. But with campuses in the crosshairs of the culture wars, many students are now also taking stock of attacks on diversity, course content and speech and speakers from both ends of the political spectrum. They’re monitoring hate crimes, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, state abortion laws and whether students like them ‒ Black, rural, military veterans, LGBTQ+ or from other backgrounds ‒ are represented and supported on campus.
“There’s no question that what’s happening at the state level is directly affecting these students,” said Alyse Levine, founder and CEO of Premium Prep, a private college admissions consulting firm in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. When they look at colleges in various states now, she said, “There are students who are asking, ‘Am I really wanted here?’”
For some students on both sides of the political divide, the answer is no. In the chaotic new world of American colleges and universities, many say they feel unwelcome at certain schools, while others are prepared to shut down speakers and report faculty with whose opinions they disagree.
It’s too early to know how much this trend will affect where and whether prospective students end up going to college since publicly available enrollment data lags real time. But there are early clues that it’s having a significant impact.
One in 4 prospective students has already ruled out a college or university for consideration because of the political climate in its state, according to a survey by the higher education consulting firm Art & Science Group.
Among students who describe themselves as liberal, the most common reason to rule out colleges and universities in a particular state, that survey found, is because it’s “too Republican” or has what they consider lax gun regulations, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, restrictive abortion laws and a lack of concern about racism. Students who describe themselves as conservative are rejecting states they believe to be “too Democrat” and that have liberal abortion and gay rights laws.
Sixty percent of prospective students of all backgrounds say new state restrictions on abortion would at least somewhat influence where they choose to go to college, a separate poll by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation found. Of these, 8 in 10 say they would prefer to go to a state with greater access to reproductive health services. (Lumina is among the funders of The Hechinger Report, which produced this story.)
“We have many young women who will not look at certain states,” said Levine. One of her own clients backed out of going to a university in St. Louis after Missouri banned almost all abortions following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, she said.
Institutions in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Texas are the most likely to be knocked off the lists of liberal students, according to the Art & Science Group survey. They’re generally most likely to steer clear of the South and Midwest, while conservative students avoid California and New York.
One in 8 high school students in Florida say they won’t go to a public university in their own state because of its education policies, a separate poll, by the college ranking and information website Intelligent.com, found.
With 494 anti-LGBTQ+ laws proposed or adopted this year, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, prospective students who are LGBTQ+ and have experienced significant harassment because of it are nearly twice as likely to say they don't plan to go to college at all compared with students who experienced lower levels of harassment, according to a survey by GLSEN, formerly the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.
“You are attacking kids who are already vulnerable,” said Javier Gomez, an LGBTQ+ student in his first year at Miami Dade College. “And it’s not just queer students. So many young people are fed up.”
It’s not yet evident whether the new laws are affecting where LGBTQ+ young people are choosing to go to college, said Casey Pick, director of law and policy at The Trevor Project, which supports LGBTQ+ young people in crisis. But LGBTQ+ adults are moving away from states passing anti-LGBTQ+ laws, she said. And “if adult employees are taking this into account when they decide where they want to live, you can bet that college students are making the same decisions.”
Since DeSantis takeover,surge in dropouts at New College of Florida
Meanwhile, in an era of pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion policies in many states, and against affirmative action in college admissions nationwide, Amankwaah is one of a growing number of Black students choosing what they see as the relative security of an HBCU. Enrollment at HBCUs increased by around 3% in 2021, the last year for which the figure is available, while the number of students at other universities and colleges fell. 
“The real attack here is on the feeling of belonging,” said Jeremy Young, who directs the Freedom to Learn program at PEN America, which tracks laws that restrict college and university diversity efforts and teaching about race. “What it really does is hoist a flag to say to the most marginalized students, ‘We don’t want you here.’” 
More than 40% of university and college administrators say the Supreme Court ruling curbing the use of affirmative action in admissions will affect diversity on their campuses, a Princeton Review poll found as the school year was beginning.
College students of all races and political persuasions report feeling uncomfortable on campuses that have become political battlegrounds. Those on the left are bristling at new laws blocking programs in diversity, equity and inclusion and the teaching of certain perspectives about race; on the right, at conservative speakers being shouted down or canceled, unpopular comments being called out in class and what they see as an embrace of values different from what they learned at home.
More than 1 in 10 students at four-year universities now say they feel as if they downright don’t belong on their campus, and another 2 in 10 neither agree nor strongly agree that they belong, another Lumina and Gallup survey found. It found that those who answer in these ways are more likely to frequently experience stress and more likely to drop out.
Military veterans who use their GI Bill benefits to return to school say one of their most significant barriers is a feeling that they won’t be welcome, a survey by the D’Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University found. Nearly two-thirds say that faculty and administrators don’t understand the challenges they face, and 70% say the same thing about their non-veteran classmates. 
Colleges should be “safe and affirming spaces,” said Pick, of the Trevor Project ‒ not places of isolation and alienation.
Yet a significant number of students say they don’t feel comfortable sharing their views in class, according to another survey, conducted by College Pulse for the right-leaning Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at North Dakota State University. Of those, 72% say they worry their opinions would be considered unacceptable by classmates and 45%, by their professors. Conservative students are less likely than their liberal classmates to believe that all points of view are welcome and less willing to share theirs. 
“Is that really an intellectually diverse environment?” asked Sean Stevens, director of polling and analytics at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, which has launched a campus free-speech ranking based on students’ perceptions of comfort expressing ideas, tolerance for speakers and other measures. 
“Anecdotally and from personal experience, there’s certainly a pocket of students who are weighing these factors in terms of where to go to college,” Stevens said.
Eighty-one percent of liberal students and 53% of conservative ones say they support reporting faculty who make comments that they find offensive, the same survey found. It used sample comments such as, “There is no evidence of anti-Black bias in police shootings,” “Requiring vaccination for COVID is an assault on individual freedom” and “Biological sex is a scientific fact.”
A professor at Texas A&M University became the subject of an investigation when a student accused her of criticizing the state’s lieutenant governor during a lecture, though she was ultimately exonerated. An anthropology lecturer at the University of Chicago who taught an undergraduate course called “The Problem of Whiteness” said she was deluged with hateful messages when a conservative student posted her photo and email address on social media.
More than half of all freshmen say that colleges have the right to ban extreme speakers, according to an annual survey by an institute at the University of California, Los Angeles; the College Pulse poll says that sentiment is held by twice the proportion of liberal students as conservative ones.
A group of Stanford students in March disrupted an on-campus speech by a federal judge whose judicial record they said was anti-LGBTQ+. When he asked for an administrator to intervene, an associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion confronted him and asked: “Is it worth the pain that this causes and the division that this causes?” The associate dean was put on leave and later resigned. 
“Today it is a sad fact that the greatest threat to free speech comes from within the academy,” pronounced the right-leaning American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which is pushing colleges to sign on to its Campus Freedom Initiative that encourages teaching students about free expression during freshman orientation and disciplining people who disrupt speakers or events, among other measures.
“I have to imagine that universities that have a bad track record on freedom of expression or academic freedom, that it will affect their reputations,” said Steven Maguire, the organization’s campus freedom fellow. “I do hear people saying things like, ‘I’m worried about what kind of a college or university I can send my kids to and whether they’ll be free to be themselves and to express themselves.’”
Some colleges are now actively recruiting students on the basis of these kinds of concerns. Colorado College in September created a program to ease the process for students who want to transfer away from institutions in states that have banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; Hampshire College in Massachusetts has offered admission to any student from New College in Florida, subject of what critics have described as a conservative takeover. Thirty-five have so far accepted the invitation.
Though many conservative critics of colleges and universities say faculty are indoctrinating students with liberal opinions, incoming freshmen tend to hold left-leaning views before they ever set foot in a classroom, according to that UCLA survey.
Fewer than 1 in 5 consider themselves conservative. Three-quarters say abortion should be legal and favor stricter gun control laws, 68% say wealthy people should pay more taxes than they do now and 86% that climate change should be a federal priority and that there should be a clear path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
Prospective students say they are watching as new laws are passed and controversies erupt on campuses and actively looking into not just the quality of food and available majors at the colleges they might attend, but state politics.
“Once I decided I was going to North Carolina Central, I looked up whether North Carolina was a red state or a blue state,” Amankwaah said. (North Carolina has a Democrat as governor but Republicans control both chambers of the legislature and hold a veto-proof supermajority in the state Senate. 
Florida’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws prompted Javier Gomez to leave his native state and move to New York to go to fashion school. But then he came back, transferring to Miami Dade.
“People ask me, ‘Why the hell are you back in Florida?’” said Gomez. “The reason I came back was that there was this innate calling in me that you have to stick around and fight for the queer and trans kids here. It’s overwhelming at times. It can be very mentally depleting. But I wanted to stay and continue the fight and build community against hatred.”

Thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed and Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate from the northern Gaza Strip ahead of Israel's impending ground invasion, leading to a humanitarian crisis that has brought protests from the United Nations and around the world.
The U.N. said about 1 million Gaza residents have been displaced in just a week, about half of them finding refuge in U.N. schools and other facilities where water supplies are diminishing. The war has claimed more than 4,000 lives since Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack Oct. 7.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization pleaded with Israel on Sunday to immediately reverse evacuation orders for hospitals in northern Gaza, saying the deadlines are impossible to meet and risk additional loss of life. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that attacks on health care facilities are already causing deaths and injuries. 
"The health situation in north Gaza is dire," Tedros wrote on social media. "Evacuation orders by Israel to hospitals are practically impossible to implement and are a death sentence for the sick and injured."
Here are several organizations that are providing aid to people caught in the conflict.
How to cope:The videos out of Israel, Gaza are graphic, but some can't look away
The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) is a coalition of more than 170 nongovernmental organizations that includes tens of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis who share the goal of building peace between the two communities.
"Our members are speaking loudly and clearly about the values that unite our community: Opposition to this horrific violence, and a commitment to Israeli/Palestinian partnership on the path to ending it, and achieving peace and equality," the agency said in a statement.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is a humanitarian organization that aims to protect and aid victims of conflicts. The ICRC has been in Israel and the occupied territories since 1967. The organization is asking for donations to improve access to essential services like water and to support livelihood projects.
Doctors Without Borders is a nongovernmental organization that describes itself as an "independent, impartial and neutral" charity that provides humanitarian aid to people affected by conflict, disease outbreaks and natural and human-made disasters.
The agency is seeking donations to continue to provide medical care in the area. The agency has reported overcrowding in hospitals, a lack of medical supplies, and dangerous working conditions as it tries to support the thousands injured by the fighting.
UNRWA has designated shelters to host the estimated 127,000 people displaced in Gaza. The agency is seeking donations to support its work.
The Jewish Agency for Israel North American Council, an American charity organization, is accepting donations to help victims of terrorism.
Save the Children issued an emergency alert in response to the conflict, noting that escalating violence has left 1.2 million children in need of humanitarian aid. The agency is accepting donations.
National and international organizations that aid victims in the conflict include the Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF), which works to provide lifesaving medical relief and humanitarian aid.
Founded by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, in partnership with Emory University, The Carter Center is a humanitarian aid organization that has been promoting peace and a viable two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades.
After Israel declared war, The Carter Center released a statement condemning the targeting of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and called for international action to end the violence.

A shaken mother on Tuesday called for the release of her daughter after Hamas released a video showing the French-Israeli hostage having her armed bandaged – the first sign of life from any of the hostages seized by Hamas in the first tumultuous hours of the war.
Keren Schem, speaking at a news conference, said she had not known if her 21-year-old daughter, Mia, was dead or alive until seeing the video Monday. Mia Schem was taken from a party at Kibbutz Reim where more than 260 revelers were killed and dozens more seized as part of the killing rampage by Hamas militants that rocked Israel and the world 10 days ago.
The video was the first depicting any of the roughly 200 hostages Israel says were taken during the attack.
"I’m begging the world to bring my baby back home," Keren Schem said. “This is a crime against humanity and we should all gather and stop this terror and bring everybody back home."
Israeli and French officials condemned the release of the video. John Kirby, the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, expressed outrage Tuesday and called for immediate release of all hostages.
"It’s despicable, deplorable that they would take these hostages and then advertise how well they’re treating them when they’re the ones who hurt them in the first place," Kirby said on NBC’s “Today” show. 
2,000 US troops told to prepareto deploy in response to Israel-Hamas war: Updates
Developments:
∎Egypt is negotiating with Israel on plans to deliver humanitarian assistance and fuel to Gaza, a senior Egyptian official told the Associated Press. Trucks have been waiting for days to deliver the aid.
∎Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned Hamas members to surrender or die: "We will wipe out the Hamas organization and dismantle it of all its capabilities.”
∎Biden will travel to Tel Aviv on Wednesday for meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, the White House said. Biden then will travel to Amman, Jordan, to meet with King Abdullah II, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
Hamas leaders were shocked at the lack of resistance from the Israeli Army when the militants crashed through the border, a member of the group's leadership team in Beirut told the Washington Post. Ali Barakeh said the plan called for capturing some hostages and quickly returning to Gaza. But the Israeli army "collapsed in front of us," he said, causing the number of hostages and Israeli casualties to soar. Israeli officials have confirmed at least 199 hostages were taken, with a death toll of more than 1,400 Israelis.
“The Israeli army has become a paper tiger,” Barakeh said.
President Joe Biden to travel to Israelon Wednesday amid war in the Middle East
A United Nations agency on Tuesday called for an independent investigation of "appalling reports" that Israeli bombings killed civilians who were evacuating northern Gaza ahead of what is expected to be a massive ground invasion by Israeli troops.
Israel had ordered more than 1 million residents of northern Gaza to evacuate.
"We urge the Israeli forces to avoid targeting civilians and civilian objects or conducting area bombardments, indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks," said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.
Those who complied with the evacuation order are now trapped in the south with little food or shelter and little or no access to clean water, sanitation, medicine and other basic needs, Shamdasani said.
Shamdasani said 4,200 people have died on both sides and large areas of Gaza "reduced to rubble."
"Every effort must be made to ensure the strict compliance by all parties to the laws of war in the conduct of hostilities and the treatment of civilians," she said, adding that humanitarian assistance must be allowed to reach Gaza "to prevent further, unnecessary loss of life."
Emotions have been running high far beyond the Middle East in the 10 days the war has raged. Many people have expressed their fears and frustrations on social media in an effort to empathize and seek personal connections to tragedies in lieu of or in addition to private conversations. Maybe to alleviate guilt, to feel like they're doing something, to "perform" uneducated solidarity.
People aiming to preserve relationships fractured by the war between Israel and Hamas should tread lightly, experts say.
"Reactions like rage and heartbreak are normal," says Kimberly Vered Shashoua, a licensed clinical social worker. "If you’re feeling too overwhelmed with your own emotions, that’s OK. Just let your partner or loved ones know you need some time or space before you are up for having deep conversations." Read more here.

The Royal Caribbean International cruise ship Rhapsody of the Seas helped evacuate U.S. nationals from Israel on Monday after canceling its itineraries due to the war. The ship sailed from Haifa, arriving in Limassol, Cyprus, early Tuesday with 159 people aboard, most of them Americans, the Cyprus website KNEWS reported. Jason Liberty, CEO of the line’s parent company Royal Caribbean Group, said in an email to employees that was shared with USA TODAY that the evacuation was conducted in partnership with the U.S. State Department. The U.S. ambassador to Cypress, Julie Fisher, was among those greeting the ship at the passenger terminal.
"Assisting Americans overseas is our highest priority & we were honored to welcome to #Limassol those who arrived from Israel," the U.S. embassy in Cyprus tweeted.

'I won't condemn Hamas':Some Palestinians are finding it hard to denounce attacks on Israel
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, and several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.

WASHINGTON — The speaker of the House is second in line to the presidency, and the United States has gone two weeks without the crucial leader in the lower chamber.
That could end on Tuesday as House lawmakers hold a vote at noon for a new speaker. While Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., has served as speaker pro tempore, it's not a role that has the same powers as the official leader.
House Republicans nominated the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, to the speakership last week. But Jordan's chances of earning 217 votes – the magic number needed to become speaker – are unclear. Democrats aren't expected to lend their GOP colleagues any support, so Republicans will have to figure out a way to coalesce around their next speaker.
Follow along here for live updates as House Republicans attempt to settle their differences and select a new speaker for the American people.
Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., nominated Jim Jordan to be the House speaker during the first round of votes on the floor Tuesday afternoon.
Stefanik, the Republican Conference Chair, called him a patriot and an America-first warrior who goes after corruption.
“Whether as Judiciary chair, conservative leader or representative for his constituents in west central Ohio, whether on the wrestling mat or in the committee room, Jim Jordan is strategic, scrappy, tough and principled,” she said.
– Rachel Looker
Attendance could change Jim Jordan’s path to the speakership. There are currently 433 members in the House and if all members vote, Jordan would need 217 votes to be elected speaker.
But Jordan only needs a majority of voting lawmakers, meaning that if some lawmakers are absent or only vote "present" that could change the math.
Right now, all members of the House are currently present besides Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., meaning 432 lawmakers will vote. Assuming no lawmakers vote "present," 217 is still the magic number for Jordan to obtain the speakership.
– Ken Tran
Jim Jordan entered the House chamber and huddled into a corner of the floor with Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. Simpson is one of the handful of House Republicans who have either said they will not support Jordan or who have expressed hesitancy over voting for the Ohio Republican.
Jordan’s efforts to work the House floor to convince holdouts reflects the uphill battle he is facing to become speaker, as lawmakers prepare for what could be a long day of multiple ballots, reminiscent of McCarthy’s pursuit of the speakership back in January.
– Ken Tran
Acting speaker Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., has gaveled the House into session ahead of the speaker election, which is expected to take place after nominating speeches and a roll call vote to determine attendance.
– Ken Tran
If Jim Jordan is elected speaker of the House, he and President Joe Biden aren't expected to work closely together.
As chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Jordan is spearheading House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into Biden. He also voted against certifying Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.
Biden hasn't gone out of his way to address the Republican infighting in the House.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier this month that the White House views the process of choosing the speaker as an internal issue, but she said the president "hopes that the House will quickly elect a speaker, because the urgent challenges facing our nation will not wait."
– Ken Tran, Marina Pitofsky
Some of the Republican lawmakers leaning against voting for Jim Jordan have said they're planning to cast their ballot for former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif, who was ousted from the leadership role earlier this month.
McCarthy has said he believe Jordan will be the next speaker of the House.
Others have said they're planning to support Steve Scalise, who withdrew from the speaker's race last week. But what lawmakers say or promise before a House vote isn't binding − they could flip their vote for or against Jordan during the formal proceedings this afternoon.
– Marina Pitofsky
No, the House fell into further chaos last week after House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., withdrew from the speaker's race despite being formally nominated by the House Republican conference.
“It’s been quite a journey and there’s still a long way to go. I just shared with my colleagues that I’m withdrawing my name,” Scalise told reporters exiting a closed-door conference meeting.
“There are still some people that have their own agendas and I was very clear, we have to put our own agendas on the side and focus on what this country needs,” Scalise added.
– Ken Tran
It takes a majority of the votes from House lawmakers present and voting for a specific candidate.
Once the vote for speaker begins, members will be called on one by one to name their choices. The House, which has 433 members and two vacancies at this time, will vote until someone wins, though they could pause and come back another day.
It’s not clear how many rounds of voting Jordan may need to become speaker, but his allies have predicted that the public vote will pressure the holdouts to support Jordan.

The Senate is not waiting for the House to elect a speaker to move on an aid package for Israel, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., reiterated on the Senate floor Tuesday morning.
Schumer, returning to D.C. this week after leading a bipartisan delegation to Tel Aviv over the weekend, said Tuesday the Senate will work quickly to pass an aid package for Israel as soon as possible that includes military support, humanitarians aid, intelligence support and diplomatic help.
“With the House in disarray, the Senate will not wait to vote on an Israeli aid package,” Schumer said. “We can’t wait for the House. Who knows what’s going to be happening there?”
Schumer said he hopes if the Senate can pass an aid package quickly with strong bipartisan support, it will inspire the House to follow suit.

No, Democratic House lawmakers aren't going to consider throwing their support behind Jim Jim Jordan, or any other Republican.
Democrats will likely cast their votes for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., though they can technically vote for any candidate they want, even if they're not a member of the House. It's a repeat of January, when Democrats held together and supported Jeffries through 15 rounds of voting.
– Marina Pitofsky
It's simple: the House is frozen without a leader.
Lawmakers in the lower chamber can't take up critical legislation without a speaker. That includes spending measures to keep the government open and avoid a shutdown, funding for aid to Israel as their war with Hamas rages on and more.
While there is currently a speaker pro tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., his authority is limited compared to a formal speaker.
– Marina Pitofsky
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent a memo to House Democrats Tuesday outlining a messaging strategy under a potential Speaker Jordan to use against Republicans ahead of next year’s elections.
The committee urged Democrats to show voters that the Republican Party lacks moderates and is unable to stand up to the ultra-conservatives within the caucus, alleging that a speakership under Jordan would mean extremism governs the House.
Republicans who vote for Jordan as speaker are “simply following Trump’s marching orders,” according to the memo, and are “incapable of governing themselves.”
The memos lists several examples of what the committee cites as Jordan’s extremism, including his choice to vote against certifying Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, his role as a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus and his voting record on issues like Medicare, 9/11 aid and disaster relief.
“The DCCC is committed to ensuring that every battleground member of the Republican conference who stands and votes for a Speaker Jordan will be making a career ending move,” the memo states.

Despite Jordan’s momentum, the Ohio Republican is still facing stiff opposition from GOP lawmakers skeptical of a Jordan speakership resulting in uncertainty as to whether Jordan can secure the speakership off of the first ballot. 
Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus and a Jordan supporter, estimated there would be eight to 10 votes against Jordan in the first ballot in an interview Tuesday morning on “The Glenn Beck Program.” 
Roy said he expects multiple rounds of voting akin to what the House saw in January, as McCarthy and his allies worked to convince holdouts to ultimately support the California Republican.
Among those possible defections is Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a moderate House Republican who represents a district President Joe Biden won in 2020. Bacon has expressed apprehension about supporting Jordan given the support he has from conservative hardliners. 
“I’m not budging. I’m a five-time commander and deployed to Middle-East four times. I’ll do what is best for country,” Bacon said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

The House is scheduled to vote on the election of a speaker at 12 p.m. ET.

Former President Donald Trump has already weighed in on the Speaker vote, taking to social media to again push Jordan’s candidacy.
“Jim Jordan will be a GREAT Speaker of the House,” Trump posted Tuesday morning on Truth Social. “As everyone knows, I have long ago given him my Complete and Total Endorsement!”
Expect Trump to take credit if Jordan prevails.

As of Tuesday morning, the nation doesn't have a new speaker of the House.
Earlier this month, a sliver of House Republicans, led by conservative hardliner Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., voted to remove former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his post over what they alleged were broken promises. 
In his pursuit of the gavel, McCarthy changed House rules to allow just one lawmaker to initiate the move to remove him, a key concession to hard-right Republicans.
In September, when a government shutdown loomed over the country and House Republicans failed to find any consensus on a short-term bill to avert a shutdown, Gaetz committed to filing a motion to vacate if McCarthy worked with Democrats to avoid a shutdown. 
As a shutdown looked all but certain, McCarthy ultimately put forth a bipartisan stopgap bill on the House floor to fund the government just hours before a shutdown would have started. Days after the shutdown was averted, Gaetz filed a motion to vacate, and his efforts to oust McCarthy succeeded, putting the House in the frozen state seen today.
− Ken Tran
There is no speaker of the House, but there is a speaker pro tempore.
McCarthy had provided a succession list to the House Clerk earlier this year in case his seat became vacant. Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., was chosen to be acting House speaker from that list.
According to House rules, the person chosen from the list “shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore.” McHenry is the interim, or temporary, speaker.
But Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, previously told USA TODAY that without a speaker, there is no one with the political authority to speak on behalf of the majority and to engage in difficult negotiations on difficult issues.

Jordan entered the House in 2007 as a conservative bomb-thrower who was a thorn in the sides of GOP leadership. The Ohio Republican is a founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, a key faction of House Republicans that haunted McCarthy and forced him to placate to the right flank of his conference throughout his speakership.
As chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Jordan is also one of few GOP lawmakers spearheading House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.
Jordan is a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump and voted against certifying Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.

Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was removed from the position of House Speaker at the start of the month, when eight Republicans joined House Democrats to vote to oust him.
McCarthy's nine-month speakership had been rocky from the start, taking 15 rounds of votes and almost a full week to be elected back in January. The California Republican managed to secure the gavel only after making several concessions to a holdout faction in his party, including a rule allowing any one member to call for the vote to remove McCarthy.
Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., took advantage of that rule immediately after House Democrats helped McCarthy pass a last minute resolution to stave off a government shutdown at the end of September.

LSU will start the upcoming women’s basketball season where it ended the last one. The defending NCAA champion Tigers were voted No. 1 in the preseason USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll.
Picked first on 29 of 32 ballots, LSU will start the campaign as the preseason No. 1 for the first time in program history after winning the school's first national championship. The remaining three first-place nods went to perennial power Connecticut. The Huskies, who get back All-America guard Paige Bueckers after she missed all of last season, will begin at No. 2 overall as they begin their quest for the program’s 12th NCAA title.
Next comes Caitlin Clark-led Iowa at No. 3, also with its highest starting point in program history. South Carolina, which began each of the last three seasons at the top, will start this time at No. 4. Virginia Tech rounds out the top five, also with its highest preseason position.

OUTLOOKS:Previewing each team ranked in the preseason Top 25
Though all 32 Division I conferences are represented on the voting panel, the preseason Top 25 is the exclusive realm of the six power leagues. The fifth-ranked Hokies head a list of seven ranked ACC teams. The Big Ten and Pac-12 come next with five apiece. The SEC has four overall, followed by the Big 12 with three and the Big East with two.
Readers with quick math skills will notice that adds up to 26. That is because Miami (Fla.) and Michigan are in a tie for 25th. Curiously, the poll also features a tie at No. 23 between Creighton and Oklahoma.
RAMALLAH, West Bank − Farhat is doing his best to accept that his family may be severely injured or even killed in the coming days.
A week ago the electrician was detained by Israeli police as he was getting ready for work in Ashkelon, a city in southern Israel close to the Gaza Strip − where he's from and where his family remain.
He says he was blindfolded, his wrists were bound and he was falsely accused of killing Israeli women and children. Eventually, he was put on a bus and deported to the West Bank, the landlocked area that forms the main bulk of the Palestinian territories.
Timeline of conflict:Why the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian fighting is among the most brutal in years
As Israel's military operation to root out Hamas and its members who massacred civilians on the country's southern border on Oct. 7 gathers momentum, its forces are gradually reducing whole neighborhoods in Gaza to rubble. Water, food, power and medicines are running out. Morgues are overflowing.
Palestinians, international aid organizations and reports from hospitals in Gaza say that more than 47 families consisting of 500 civilians in Gaza have been wiped out by Israel's bombing campaign. And because of this, their own rough treatment at the hands of Israeli authorities and their long, violent and bitter shared history with the country, Palestinians like Farhat and others in the wider community are finding it hard to denounce the attacks on Israel even though they say they don't approve of violence against civilians.
"Killing anybody is wrong," said a Palestinian man chatting with friends Saturday in downtown Ramallah.
"But imagine you live somewhere and I come and lock you in your house. I control everything that comes in and out of your house. Occasionally, I come and beat you up. Eventually you're going to resist and start fighting back with whatever you have," he said. With the Hamas attacks, "that's what's happening."
Israel contends it controls access to Gaza for security reasons.
"I am powerless to help them, and for every 10 times I try to reach them on the phone, I get through maybe once," Farhat, 60, said Saturday, speaking about his wife, 12 children and "many grandchildren" on the grounds of a school in Ramallah. That's where 130 Palestinian workers from Gaza, deported from Israel alongside him, were being temporarily sheltered in a large hall. USA TODAY could not independently verify their accounts, but all had similar stories of detention and displacement. The Israel Prison Service did not return a request for comment.
The full names of the men at the school spoken to for this story are being withheld, at their request, for their own safety. Other names of Palestinians are being withheld to limit possible damage to their professional reputations.
Hamas attacks Israel:How police and military are still trying to find the gunmen
The school hall in Ramallah was filled with floor mats arranged in neat rows, rumpled sleeping bags, discarded plastic water bottles and scores of pacing men − only men − who said they simply had no idea how they could help themselves or their families, let alone reunite with them.
"I don't care if I die," said Imad, 58, another Palestinian electrician from Gaza who was deported to the West Bank with Farhat. He has eight children and helps care for several more from a son who died a few years ago after a battle with cancer. Farhat said he is never certain whether his family members are alive or dead.
Hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing to the south of Gaza, close to Egypt, with whatever they can carry and by whatever means of transportation they can find. With fuel scarce, some are using horses and carts.
The Palestinian health ministry says more than 2,700 Palestinians have been killed since the fighting erupted, and fatalities are occurring at a rate of every five minutes amid Israeli airstrikes.
Almost 10,000 Gazans, half of them women and children, have been injured. As many as 50,000 pregnant women are not able to access basic health services, according to the U.N. So far, Israel has not allowed aid in. It says it wants Hamas to release captives first. Egypt has been unwilling to open its border to fleeing Gazans.
"Where can we go? We are all under attack," said Imad's wife, Hayat, when reached by phone Saturday in Khan Younis, a city in the south of Gaza. The city has ballooned to more than 1 million people as Israel's military has warned Palestinian civilians to leave northernGaza ahead of an expected ground offensive targeting Hamas.
Khan Younis usually has a population of about 400,000 people.
Many Palestinians at the school in Ramallah drew attention to their bruised wrists.
The bruises are the result, they said, of zip ties placed on them by Israeli police. For years Israel has adopted a controversial policy of "administrative detention," which allows the authorities to detain Palestinians of all ages without trial and under allegations it keeps secret. Israel says the tactic is necessary to contain dangerous militants whom the government believes could be terrorists.
Rights groups argue the practice amounts to extrajudicial detention and punishment.
Farhat and Imad said police refused to let them use the bathroom while they were being held.
They showed photos on their phones, taken by eyewitnesses, of what appeared to be them kneeling while blindfolded in front of police and other Israeli security services. They said that the younger men among them were beaten, though they also said that some Israeli soldiers sought to intervene to stop it.
"They cursed us, treated us like animals and accused us of killing (Israeli) children − of being responsible for (the attacks in Israel) and what's happening in Gaza," Farhat said.
"'Piss in your pants if you need to,' the Israeli soldiers told us," Imad said.
A third man at the school who was listening to Imad speak said he and his wife, who is in Gaza, have decided it would be best for her die in their own home rather than evacuate to the south.
"There is no safe place in Gaza," he said. "Every place is targeted. The worst thing about this whole experience for me is that I am here but my mind is back there."
Earlier that Saturday, word arrived that the entire family of another Palestinian worker staying at the school had been killed in an Israeli bombardment. He got so emotional and enraged he was taken to a medical clinic to be given sedatives.
The school where the workers were staying serves 800 children from kindergarten up to high school.
Its director said some parents were concerned that the men's presence could cause it to be raided by Israel's military or attacked by vigilante Jewish settlers in the West Bank seeking to exact some kind of revenge for the 1,400 Israelis killed when Hamas crossed the border from Gaza to Israel to attack and kidnap civilians and soldiers.
The Israeli settlers live in West Bank communities that are illegal under international law. These settlements are built on Palestinian lands in a Palestinian-governed area that Israeli's military has occupied since it won a war in 1967 with Arab countries.
"Nowadays nobody can tell what these settlers will do," the director said, referring to the communities that have been expanded under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and are opposed by some Israelis.
"They seem free to do, and kill, whoever they like."
Since the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas more than a week ago, at least 56 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,100 have been wounded in the West Bank in attacks on them by settlers and in confrontations with Israel's military, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Some of those killed, according to Palestinian activists, included minors shot in the head, chest and abdomen.
On Friday alone, traditionally a day of protest, at least 14 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank in clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians near roads leading to checkpoints. Some were killed by settlers.
Many of the Palestinians USA TODAY encountered in Ramallah and surrounding West Bank areas said that while they reject the idea of violence against civilians, Israelis or otherwise, they do not believe or feel it is their responsibility to forcefully condemn or repudiate the Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians.
Many also don't view Hamas as terrorist organization, as the U.S. and European Union designate it. They see the group as acting in self-defense to Israeli military actions.
Hamas is the de facto ruler of Gaza.
This refusal to condemn Hamas − a group that believes Israel should not exist − has angered the Israeli public and large swaths of international opinion as accounts and gory details have emerged of executions and kidnappings committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians. Among the kidnapped are elderly women and small children. Israel estimates that about 200 people, some of them police and soldiers, are being held hostage by Hamas. Fourteen Americans remain unaccounted for, though it is unclear how many may be held hostage.
An American advocated for Palestinians:Then Hamas came
Human rights groups say they are tracking evidence of war crimes committed by both sides, with Israel's indiscriminate military campaign and "complete siege of Gaza" − its withholding of water, food, electricity and fuel − amounting to a "collective punishment" on Palestinian civilians, according to the United Nations. Both Israel and Hamas insist they are operating within the confines of international law.
“We are at war. We are defending our homes," Israeli President Isaac Herzog said at a media briefing Friday. “That’s the truth. And when a nation protects its home, it fights. And we will fight until we break their backbone.”
In an interview with the Economist magazine last week, Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas leader, said that his group's operation in Israel targeted only "military posts."
The official news agency of the Palestinian Authority, which exercises civilian control over the West Bank, published comments Sunday by President Mahmoud Abbas that criticized Hamas for its actions. It later removed a reference to Hamas without providing an explanation.
On Monday, the news agency published comments from Abbas in which he rejected the killing of civilians on both sides and called for the release of civilians, prisoners and detainees on both sides. He did not mention Hamas.
On the outskirts of Ramallah, a 25-year-old graduate student was taking a break from her studies at a coffee shop in an upscale business park. She's studying for a master's degree in international law and wants to specialize in defending the human rights of Palestinians.
She was born in Chicago and holds dual citizenship.
She said there are a multitude of reasons why Palestinians like her are finding it hard to criticize Hamas.
Among them: Palestinians feel they have lived for decades in a world where attacks on them by Israelis have not been given similar public censure; millions of Palestinians lack basic rights as a result of Israel's military occupation, which imposes onerous restrictions on their movement, controls their water resources, and subjects them to forced evictions, police harassment, arbitrary detention and numerous other everyday indignities; Israeli transgressions of international law with its settlements and military actions are shrugged off; and Israel has slowly taken more Palestinian land while ministers in Netanyahu's government have openly called for ethic cleansing against Palestinian civilians.
"It hurts me that America is supporting Israel so much," she said.
"I won't condemn Hamas (for its attacks against Israeli civilians in the south) because Israel has been violating our rights for years. They've killed thousands in Gaza over several wars. What happened was a consequence of their own actions. We have the right to defend ourselves, and this is the first time we've done it."
She said some of the images and videos she had seen on social media of Hamas' brutalities in Israel were a "tough" watch. But she didn't think these images and videos represented the "real Hamas," just the actions of lone bad actors. She said pregnant women and babies in Gaza were routinely killed by Israeli bombs.
"We don't want them dead," she said of Israelis. "We want them out of our lands."
A few tables away, a Palestinian man who lives in the U.S. and works for a well-known U.S. technology firm said he, too, thought it was not appropriate to condemn Hamas for its assault on Israelis.
"Being a Palestinian, you are continuously under systematic violence on a daily basis," he said.
"A lot of it is invisible to the external world. Yet literally two hills away from where were are sitting is an illegally occupied settlement. They call them 'settlements.' But that's actually too benign a word. It's actually a colony. Palestinians are surrounded by extremists who are colonizing our lands."
He said Americans and others who don't know the region very well need to understand that "there's a context (to the Hamas raid in Israel on Oct. 7) that's a lot larger than a single event."
Israel pulled out of its settlements in Gaza in 2005 and has since fought multiple wars there with Hamas.
On Saturday night, USA TODAY briefly visited a hill on the edge of Ramallah near a giant bronze statue of South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela where groups of Palestinians had gathered.
They chatted excitedly as they sat around small fires and snacked on seeds and nuts.
They also scanned the horizon for signs of Hamas rockets launched from Gaza toward Tel Aviv, whose lights lay shimmering about 25 miles away. None flew by over the course of an hour.
Let's talk about your peace plan:Rep. Rashida Tlaib's grandmother to Donald Trump
Less than a mile away, a green laser sight emanating from an adjacent Israeli settlement scanned this same hillside, its beam occasionally coming to stop in the bushes 100 yards or so down from the viewing point.
One man who was watching remarked that he thought it was an Israeli sniper looking for Palestinian intruders.
Khaldoun Barghouti, a Ramallah-based Palestinian researcher and analyst of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, said he believes Israel's decision to bomb Gaza, killing hundreds of civilians and causing widespread destruction, has led to more support for Hamas among Palestinians.
He said it has "turned blame to Hamas (over the attacks in Israel) into more anger toward Israel."
In the U.S,  a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy died Sunday after he was stabbed in Illinois. Authorities believe the attack was in response to the Israel-Hamas war. Attorney General Merrick Garland warned the incident would raise fears among Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities about hate-fueled violence.
A number of European countries have heightened protection for Jewish communities because of a rise in antisemitic incidents after Hamas’ attacks.
Farhat, Imad and the other Palestinians from Gaza at the school who were receiving sanctuary after being deported from Israel were moved Sunday to Jericho, a West Bank Palestinian city in the Jordan Valley.
On Saturday, when they weren't trying to check on their families, they spent most of their time staring at snippets of video on their phones that showed the impact of Israel's bombing campaign.
Floppy children being rushed, half-dead, to hospitals. Streams of exhausted-looking Gazans converging on Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza, only to find unbelievably cramped conditions.
They collected names of Palestinians, fellow workers in Israel, whom they had not seen since their arrest.
They were getting worried about what happened to them.
One man named Mahmoud was trying to solve what seemed like yet another insurmountable problem.
A relative and the man's friend, he said, neighbors back in Gaza, were hiding in a room in southern Israel, where they worked in a kitchen. They had been there since the first day of the Hamas assault and now feared that if they ventured outside, Israel's military would mistake them for militants.
They shared their Israeli work permits to prove their identities.
They were't sure what to do. They might try to sneak out.
"They don't know we are here. If they did I think they'd kill us," one of the men said in a phone call with USA TODAY. They did not want their location or identity to be made public.
He estimated they had enough food and water for another three days.
Britney Spears is opening up in a new interview, her first in years, about her anticipated tell-all and becoming her own woman after being freed from her 13-year conservatorship.
The pop star's anticipated new memoir, "The Woman in Me," is set to debut on Oct. 24, and excerpts from the book were released on Tuesday via People.
In a shocking revelation, Spears, 41, claimed in her memoir that she became pregnant during her relationship with Justin Timberlake and had an abortion.
"Justin definitely wasn't happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren't ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young," she wrote, according to the outlet.
Spears and Timberlake dated from 1999 until 2002 in their early adult years.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
In an accompanying new interview done via email with People, Spears discussed how she is handling her "new freedom" in the wake of the nearly 14-year-long conservatorship under her father, Jamie Spears, 71, which a Los Angeles County judge terminated in November 2021.
As her relationships have evolved with her family, including her dad, mom Lynne Spears, 68, and sister Jamie Lynn Spears, 32, and model and actor Sam Asghari, 29, with whom she split in August after 14 months of marriage, Spears told People life after the conservatorship has its difficulties.
"Learning this new freedom, I'll admit, is challenging at times," the "Gimme More" singer said.
But in releasing her memoir, she tells people she is "finally free" to tell her story.
"Over the past 15 years or even at the start of my career, I sat back while people spoke about me and told my story for me," she said. "It is finally time for me to raise my voice and speak out, and my fans deserve to hear it directly from me. No more conspiracy, no more lies — just me owning my past, present and future."
Spears has accused her father and others of exploitation and abuse under the conservatorship, detailing in the memoir how she was made to feel like "a sort of child-robot" and a "shadow" of herself.
"The conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child," the "Womanizer" singer writes in the excerpt of the memoir shared with People. "I became more of an entity than a person onstage. I had always felt music in my bones and my blood; they stole that from me."
Delving further into the past, Spears writes of her casting on the Mickey Mouse Club at 11 with Christina Aguilera and Ryan Gosling, including how the cast would "run choreography thirty times in a day" and how she kissed castmate Timberlake at a sleepover.
"At a sleepover, we played Truth or Dare, and someone dared Justin to kiss me," Spears writes. "A Janet Jackson song was playing in the background as he leaned in and kissed me."
Spears also details how her first movie role in the 2002 year drama-comedy film "Crossroads" caused her to inadvertently fall into method acting.
"I ended up walking differently, carrying myself differently, talking differently. I was someone else for months while I filmed 'Crossroads,'" the "Oops!…I Did It Again" singer writes.
Getting too deep into a character made her "glad" she didn't get the role of Allie Hamilton in "The Notebook" opposite Gosling, which ended up going to Rachel McAdams.
"That was pretty much the beginning and end of my acting career, and I was relieved," she continued. "'The Notebook' casting came down to me and Rachel McAdams, and even though it would have been fun to reconnect with Ryan Gosling after our time on the Mickey Mouse Club, I'm glad I didn't do it."
Baby, one more time!Britney Spears' 'Crossroads' movie returns to theaters in October
Spears also talked about growing up in Louisiana, her work ethic as a child star, getting a record deal at Jive Records at 15, and her infamous 2001 VMA performance of "I'm a Slave 4 U."
The "snake's tongue is flicking out at me. Right. Now," she writes. "Finally, I got to the part where I handed it back, thank God."
The excerpts also include her thoughts on becoming a tabloid fixture in the early 2000s, the harm it caused, the termination of her conservatorship, and how she hopes telling her story inspires others.
"Shaving my head and acting out were my ways of pushing back," Spears writes.
"The woman in me was pushed down for a long time. They wanted me to be wild onstage, the way they told me to be, and to be a robot the rest of the time," she said. "I felt like I was being deprived of those good secrets of life — those fundamental supposed sins of indulgence and adventure that make us human.
"It took a long time and a lot of work for me to feel ready to tell my story," she said. "I hope it inspires people on some level and can touch hearts."
"The Woman in Me" will be released on Oct. 24 by Gallery Books, a Simon & Schuster imprint.
Spears previously co-authored the 2000 autobiography "Britney Spears' Heart to Heart," and the 2001 young adult novel "A Mother's Gift" with her mother, Lynne Spears, both of which appeared on the USA TODAY Best-Selling books list.

Britney Spears memoirwill be released in October: 'The publishing event of the year'
Rabbi Igael Gurin-Malous grew up in an Orthodox home, spending time in Belgium, Israel and the United States. Today, he's a gay, tattooed, non-denominational rabbi living in New York.
Most of the people he went to Jewish boys school with are right-wing. This week, those same peers bullied him in group chats. They called him a Hebrew word meaning a traitor to the other side. Because he "dared to" suggest that Israel's current military response in Gaza "is not the only way to to address the (Israeli-Palestinian conflict)."
His situation resembles many across the U.S. and rest of the world as people grapple with differing opinions among friends, family and colleagues; A college group text devolving because no one can agree. Millennials walking on eggshells for fear of upsetting their Gen Z partners.
There's no one way to approach sensitive issues of this nature. But experts say those aiming to preserve relationships fractured by the war between Israel and Hamas should tread lightly.
"Reactions like rage and heartbreak are normal," says Kimberly Vered Shashoua, a licensed clinical social worker. "If you’re feeling too overwhelmed with your own emotions, that’s OK. Just let your partner or loved ones know you need some time or space before you are up for having deep conversations."
Emotions have been running high since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7; 4,200 have died on both sides, according to the United Nations.
"It's creating these distances that people feel unseen, unheard, vilified," Gurin-Malous says.
Many have expressed their fears and frustrations on social media in an effort to empathize and seek personal connections to tragedies in lieu of or in addition to private conversations. Maybe to alleviate guilt, to feel like they're doing something, to "perform" uneducated solidarity.
These posts often go awry when people play the comparison game. "The problem is not the desire to find a personal connection," says Benjamin Goldman, licensed mental health counselor. "The problem is when conversations become about comparing degrees of suffering and pain. And during this time that we're in right now, there's a lot of data and a lot of real information." Anyone can throw statistics at a situation to try and justify their points. But many aren't really looking for meaningful conversation
Aziz Abu-Sarah's octogenarian parents live in Jerusalem. He visited them there three weeks ago. Now, he's afraid for their safety. A Palestinian peacemaker, his Israeli and Palestinian friends have been asking him how to broker dialogue.
"My advice was this: refrain (from) political discussions," he says. "Don't talk heavy politics right now. You always do, you will eventually, but now, maybe is not the time to start going into what happened 100 years ago and 50 years ago. This is just the wrong time for that."
Before engaging with someone on as sensitive a topic as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, consider who you are talking to (i.e. where do they fall on the issue) and have a goal in mind. Are you looking to vent? For a dialogue? To change their mind?
Because "if you're looking for a conversation that takes place in a shared experience in pain, and then you go to someone with a conflicting experience from you to have that conversation, you will be hurt," Goldman says. "And they will also probably be hurt." That said, "if you must share information that you feel very strongly about, it’s best to adopt a non-confrontational attitude – even if you believe you are right," says Cecille Ahrens, a licensed clinical social worker.
It may also be worth some introspection. "We would be wise to remember that we are each a product of our own lived experience steeped in the culture that surrounds us," says Laura Petiford, a licensed marriage and family therapist. "Additionally, we are influenced by the media's synthesis of information and the mediums we trust to deliver it to our screens and inboxes."
Focus less on politics and more on the personal if you're aiming for a productive conversation. "Try and connect from a human perspective on fear and isolation, and not being seen, and all the other emotions that we all feel whenever there is war," Gurin-Malous says.
Abu-Sarah adds: "Being vulnerable for each other and being willing to listen, instead of being quick to fight and argue – this is true in all situations."
He suggests focusing less on your position at the start of a dialogue and more on your story: "Before we start taking positions: 'Here why I stand (for Israel's) right to defend itself; here's why I stand for Palestinians' right to end occupation.' Before you say, your position, tell your story. It's more important."
Consider, too, "is there any common ground from which you can start?" asks Regine Galanti, a clinical psychologist. "Can you agree that all civilian deaths are terrible and tragic? That it's not OK to kidnap women and children? That it's terrible for people not to have access to basic utilities? Again, if you have no common ground, it might not be a conversation worth having right now."
You are also allowed to hit pause if you're not ready to talk just yet. "It's OK to avoid conversations with friends or family if you're not  emotionally in the right place for these disagreements," Galanti adds. "I've been muting a lot of my Instagram stories – even of people that I agree with – because I go to Instagram to unwind, and the constant barrage of videos on the Israeli-Gaza conflict make me anxious instead."
Watch out:Israel, Gaza and when your social media posts hurt more than help
Some relationships may not survive disagreements of this nature. And that is OK, too.
For Gurin-Malous, some wounds won't scar. They'll sit as open wounds.
"Some of the damage that has been done to me, and some of the relationships that I have around this, I think are irreparable," he says. "You can't unsay things you've said. And with that, I also want to allow for the fact that this is a very hot button (issue) for everybody involved." Still, "I want to also bring some compassion to the fact that sometimes we say things that we don't mean. And sometimes we out of fear lash out. And it is unfortunate, I think that many, many times, we reserve our worst behavior for the people we love the most."
Remember, as Abu-Sarah says: "Behind every angry statement, behind every talking point we throw at each other, there's a hurt person."
In case you missed:The videos out of Israel, Gaza are graphic, but some can't look away: How to cope
NFL power rankings entering Week 7 of the 2023 season (previous rank in parentheses):
1. 49ers (1): Way too premature to suggest they got exposed against the league's No. 1 defense – especially amid circumstances when you'd expect QB Brock Purdy to have his worst professional game given the staggered absences Sunday of injured Pro Bowlers Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel and Trent Williams around him. Depending on the injuries, there could be an extended setback here, but almost certainly not one that signals the Niners are in major jeopardy.
2. Lions (3): They're indeed in rare air – one more win would make them 6-1 for the first time in the Super Bowl era (since 1966). And while it can be dangerous to look too far ahead, even for a team on a four-game heater, there don't appear to be many losses on the other side of Detroit's Week 9 bye. And if their RB room gets healthy, and WR Jameson Williams continues morphing into the weapon he was intended to be? Roar.
3. Chiefs (4): Including postseason, QB Patrick Mahomes has now started 100 NFL games … and won 80 of them. Crazy. Fifteen percent of his career victories, or 12, have come against Denver – a team that will be back in Kansas City's crosshairs in Week 8.
4. Eagles (2): Time to find something out about a team that largely tightroped its way to 5-0. But Philly couldn't hang in the Jets' mosh pit, and next must try and keep pace with Miami's track team. Maybe breaking out the Kelly Green for "Sunday Night Football" will have the desired effect, though.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
5. Bills (5): Trust issues are becoming evident for a team that's won three laughers, including the Week 4 runaway from the Fins, but had trouble waking up in its other three contests. New England should pose little problem in Week 7, but then Buffalo will be under the prime-time microscope for three in a row.
6. Dolphins (6): How good – really – is this offense? The numbers, individually and collectively, have it tracking to be among the best in league history. In fact, Miami's O is averaging better than 100 yards more than the second-ranked Eagles. But dates with the Philly and K.C. defenses in two of the next three weeks should provide litmus tests … like the one Miami failed at Buffalo in Week 4.
7. Jaguars (7): A club that just spent two weeks in London now hits the road for two more games outside Duval County. RB Travis Etienne has 339 yards and four TDs from scrimmage during Jacksonville's three-game winning streak.
8. Cowboys (8): Scratching out a win in LA against the Chargers – in front of legions of Dallas fans – salvaged a bye week that was on the verge of ruination, especially pitted against former OC Kellen Moore and coming on the heels of the blowout in San Francisco. WR Brandin Cooks' TD catch Monday means he's reached the end zone with five NFL teams.
9. Steelers (9): A team that's won three of four coming out of its bye week is also about to get WR Diontae Johnson back on an offense that needs a spark.
10. Ravens (10): A team that's only had two home games will play four of its next five in Baltimore. Fun fact: Lamar Jackson has joined Michael Vick as the only quarterbacks to rush for at least 50 yards in a game 50 times.
11. Browns (13): Cleveland's stingy D has ceded 1,002 yards, fewest through five games in 52 years. On average, the Browns are surrendering 200.4 yards a week, more than 60 fewer than Baltimore's second-ranked defense.
12. Bengals (22): They leveled back to .500 entering a much-needed bye week. QB Joe Burrow, WR Tee Higgins and Co. better rest up, though, because they're not scheduled to face a team currently below .500 until Week 15, a stretch that starts with the Niners and Bills.
13. Rams (11): WR Puka Nacua's production has unsurprisingly downshifted with the return of Cooper Kupp, but he's still carved out a nice piece of historical real estate. The rookie's 50 catches for 598 yards are both records in the Super Bowl era for a player through six career games.
14. Seahawks (12): Despite Sunday's pair of unfortunate INTs, QB Geno Smith's mistakes are essentially on par with 2022's level. It's his touchdown production that's down by nearly half.
15. Jets (21): Per HC Robert Saleh, "(W)e’ve played a gauntlet of quarterbacks. I know we haven’t gotten all wins, but we’ve embarrassed all of them." Whether or not that's legitimately true, it's a fact this defense hasn't allowed as many as 300 net passing yards since the end of the 2021 season. (And, yes, it was to Tom Brady, who was rarely embarrassed by the Jets.)
16. Texans (18): They have two players with at least three TD catches … same as the entirety of Houston's 2022 season. No team has fewer giveaways than their three.
17. Buccaneers (14): If you don't want QB Baker Mayfield to shoulder an inordinate amount of the offensive load, you can't wallow at the bottom of the league with 3.0 yards per carry.
18. Saints (15): Here's a crazy factoid: Since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, Walter Payton is the only player to have more games (25) with a pass attempt, carry and catch than New Orleans' Taysom Hill (20).
19. Chargers (20): You can argue they stole defeat from the jaws of victory yet again. Now? Better regroup quickly for a short week that will end in Kansas City against the rested Chiefs … in a game the Bolts really need.
20. Raiders (23): A win at Chicago on Sunday puts Las Vegas above .500 … which wouldn’t be bad at all for a team tied for the AFC lead with 12 turnovers.
21. Packers (24): Assuming they're revitalized coming out of their bye, could be time to go on a run given they're not scheduled to see an opponent currently sporting a winning record until Week 10.
22. Vikings (25): Another week and another key injury (LB Marcus Davenport, ankle) for a struggling team apparently determined not to have a fire sale.
23. Commanders (27): With four of their next six against NFC East opponents, including both games against the Giants, Washington could well be entering a stretch that determines its season … and quite possibly HC Ron Rivera's viability beyond 2023.
24. Falcons (16): Is there any head coach more fun to watch – meaning, literally taking in his facial expressions – than Arthur Smith? If he wants the focus back on his brilliance as a play caller and not his sideline grimaces, Smith might need to pivot to QB Taylor Heinicke.
25. Titans (19): QB Ryan Tannehill's ankle injury effectively sunk Tennessee in 2022. It's come earlier this year.
26. Colts (17): QB Anthony Richardson's shoulder injury will likely scuttle his rookie season, per owner Jim Irsay. Probably an unsurvivable setback … unless RB Jonathan Taylor displays his 2021 form soon.
27. Giants (29): ESPN Stats & Info sums up their start pretty well, noting the G-Men are the fourth team since 1950 which failed to score an offensive touchdown before halftime in each of their first six games. In fact, New York's offense hasn't scored a TD since Week 3.
28. Broncos (28): They'll only leave Denver one time from now until December. That may not necessarily be a plus given how this 1-5 outfit is trending … though if Sean Payton continues offloading players, at least the home fans will have some new guys to boo.
29. Bears (26): Two steps forward, one step back for QB Justin Fields, whose dislocated thumb threatens to send this squad back into hibernation.
30. Cardinals (30): That's three straight losses by an average of 16.7 points per. It took a month, but it appears the Cards are who we thought they were.
31. Patriots (31): Among their many, many failings? No team has fewer takeaways (3). And no team has a higher percentage of drives (81.7%) that end without points.
32. Panthers (32): Little has gone right for Carolina, but at least WR Adam Thielen continues to shine. Only two undrafted players have more 100-yard receiving games than his 24, and only one (Wes Welker) has more with double-digit catches than Thielen's eight.

WASHINGTON − A bipartisan group of five U.S. senators in Tel Aviv were eating lunch in a hotel Sunday when sirens went off warning of incoming rockets.
The congressional delegation, led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., rushed to a shelter until the area was safe. It was an experience, Schumer said, that Israelis now have every day as war rages on between Israel and Hamas.
"It shows you what Israelis have to go through," Schumer wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. "We must provide Israel with the support required to defend itself."
Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel earlier this month that has led to a conflict with a death toll surpassing 4,000 people. Israeli defense forces responded, triggering a war between the country and Hamas, a terrorist group that controls the Gaza Strip.
Schumer led the bipartisan delegation to Israel over the weekend with Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, as well as Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah.
After a week-long recess last week, the Senate was back in session Monday, with the war in Israel the center of attention. But with the House unable to elect a speaker, Schumer is in the driver's seat steering the upper chamber to pass an aid package for Israel with enough bipartisan support that it will inspire the House to follow suit.
The House cannot consider aid to Israel, or other crucial legislation, until lawmakers pick a speaker.
"America will stand with its ally Israel and I, along with my colleagues here, will lead the effort in the United States to provide Israel with the support required to fully defend itself from this monstrous attack," Schumer said during a press conference in Tel Aviv Sunday.

Schumer sent a clear message from Tel Aviv over the weekend: Despite the dysfunction and missing leadership in the House, the Senate would not wait on the lower chamber to pass an aid package to support Israel.
"We're not waiting for the House. We believe if the Senate acts in a strong, bipartisan way, it may indeed improve the chances that the House − even with its current dysfunction − will act," he said, adding that waiting on the House to elect a speaker and pass support for Israel would be "foolish."
Schumer said he personally would lead the effort to ensure Israel has the support it needs and anticipated moving a package in the next few weeks that would include military, intelligence, diplomatic and humanitarian assistance. He also called on lawmakers to work together and with the Biden administration to put together a plan.
The bipartisan delegation met with Israeli leaders including President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as family members of victims of the attacks or of those taken hostage by Hamas.
Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., part of the delegation, said the meetings he had with families of the American hostages were some of the toughest meetings he's had as a senator. He revealed that the photos and videos of the brutal attacks against Israelis were like nothing he had seen in his life, including in the 25 years he spent in the Navy flying in combat over Iraq and Kuwait.
"I will speak to members of Congress one by one if that's what it takes to get Israel the munitions that you need to defend yourselves," he said in Tel Aviv.
Schumer, the highest ranking Jewish elected official in the United States, said he felt he had an obligation to visit Israel in the midst of the war.
The purpose of trip was threefold, according to the majority leader. First, leaders wanted to send a clear message to the Israeli people that the United States stands with Israel. They also wanted to meet with Israeli leaders to discuss the country's military, intelligence and humanitarian needs to best inform a future aid package. Lastly, leaders said they were seeking to show that Israel's support in the United States is bipartisan.
"I'm doing everything in my power to ensure the Senate delivers the support Israel needs to accomplish these military intelligence and humanitarian goals. We will not just talk. We will act. We will work to move this aid through the Senate ASAP," he said.
Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., the only Jewish woman in the Senate, joined the delegation and said in Tel Aviv the United States stands with Israel "now and always."
"Our support remains unwavering and unconditional," she said.
Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., one of two Republicans in the delegation, said Americans living in Israel he met with during the trip all drew hope from the U.S' relationship with the country. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, condemned those who feel the U.S. should not get involved in the conflict.
"Backing away and saying, 'Hey, we're not going to worry about it' is not going to end their efforts,'" Romney said, later adding, "We're involved in the world because it's in America's interest, it's in Israel's interest, it's on all of our allies' interests (and) it's in the world's interest."
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., agreed with the need to support Israel in a speech on the Senate floor Monday.
"The United States must continue to provide maximum supports to Israel's counterterrorist operation as long as it takes," the minority leader said.
The delegation's visit to Israel comes as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to hold a nomination hearing for Jacob Lew to be U.S. Ambassador to Israel. The United States currently does not have a designated ambassador.
But Lew, who served as Treasury Department secretary under former President Barack Obama's administration, doesn't face a path to ambassadorship without some hurdles.
Several Republican senators, including Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., have said they won't support Lew for the role.
"Jack Lew is an Iran sympathizer who has no business being our ambassador," Cotton said on "Fox News Sunday." "It's bad for the U.S. It's bad for Israel."
Cotton, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, claimed Lew helped Iran avoid American sanctions and lied to Congress about it.
"I know Democrats are saying that we need to confirm Jack Lew quickly to show our support for Israel. I would say it's the exact opposite. We need to defeat Jack Lew's nomination to show we have a new approach to Iran," he added.
Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, claimed Lew was a "key point man" in negotiations under the Obama administration related to agreements with Iran.
"Lew must answer for the failed Obama-Biden Middle East strategy as he appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing next week," Hagerty posted last week on X.
Schumer urged his colleagues in the committee to approve Lew as quickly as possible "without any partisan delays" to bring the nominee to the Senate floor for a full vote.
"Mr. Lew has proven himself a strong public servant, a ferocious ally of Israel, so delaying him would be egregious at a time like this. We must move him quickly and I hope we will," he said Monday on the Senate floor.
But what's next for lawmakers as the House remains without a speaker?
Schumer explained on the Senate floor Monday afternoon that the upper chamber will meet for an all-senators classified meeting Wednesday to hear from top Biden administration officials, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Chair of the Joint Chiefs Gen. C.Q. Brown and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.
"It is essential that we hear what is going on with our top leaders," Schumer said.
Millie Bobby Brown had an unexpected feminist awakening.
The "Stranger Things" star, 19, revealed in her Glamour UK "Women of the Year" cover story published Monday that she discovered she was a feminist after a psychic told her she was.
After the session, Brown recalled searching, "How do I know if I'm a feminist?" on Google and reading books and articles on the topic to understand "the idea of feminism and what it means to me."
"Ultimately (feminism is) about opportunity," she discovered in her quest for more knowledge on the topic.
Brown said she founded her production company PCMA with the aim of providing opportunities to girls and young women. Her upcoming film "Damsel" takes it to the next level: "The theme is feminism," she told the outlet.
Although the British actress didn't realize at an early age that she was a feminist, she had already been doing the work as UNICEF's youngest Goodwill Ambassador at age 14, promoting the need for menstrual products around the world.
Brown, who got engaged to Jon Bon Jovi's son Jake Bongiovi earlier this year, also dished on how her relationship helped her embrace herself.
"I think I was so afraid to be a strong woman in a relationship," she said. "When I met Jake, I just felt I could be loud. He embraced that and encouraged that. And I fell in love with myself while being with him."
The "Enola Holmes" star added that Bongiovi affirmed the positive qualities about her that she initially "hated about myself."
"Those are things that I love about myself now. He was a really big, huge part of me loving myself and becoming a woman," Brown said. "It was like, 'Wow, I really love this person because he allows me to love myself.'"
Millie Bobby Brown details romancewith fiancé Jake Bongiovi, special connection to engagement ring
The "Enola Holmes" actress hinted at her engagement to Bongiovi in an affectionate Instagram post in April.
In the photo, Bongiovi wrapped his arms around Brown at the beach. The "Stranger Things" star wore a beautiful ring on her engagement finger as she cuddled into her boyfriend.
"I've loved you three summers now, honey, I want 'em all," she captioned the post, referencing lyrics from Taylor Swift's 2019 hit "Lover."
The "Stranger Things" star and Bongiovi went Instagram official in November 2021 after sparking romance rumors in June 2021 when they were spotted holding hands through New York City. The couple later made their red carpet debut at the 2022 BAFTAs.

Drake calls out 'weirdos'discussing Millie Bobby Brown friendship in 'For All the Dogs'
WINTER HAVEN, Fla. — Each October, Teresa Scalf’s relatives prepare for the painful anniversary of her murder in 1986.
This year, for the first time, the family members will at least know who committed the vicious killing 37 years ago.
Through an investigation based on retained blood from the killer and public genetic databases, the Polk County (Florida) Sheriff’s Office identified Donald Douglas, a former neighbor of Scalf’s, as the murderer. Douglas, 33 at the time of the killing, died of natural causes at 54 in 2008, PCSO said.
Scalf’s mother, Betty Scalf, and two of Teresa’s sisters joined Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd for a news conference Monday as Judd described how his agency solved the 37-year-old case.
“All I want to say is, I'm 84 years old,” said Betty Scalf, a petite, white-haired woman who uses a cane. “I lived to see this done. I think that’s why I lived so long.”
Scalf found the mutilated body of her daughter on Oct. 27, 1986, in the duplex she shared with her 8-year-old son in an unincorporated area of Lakeland, about 35 miles east of Tampa. Teresa Scalf, 29, worked the night shift as a trauma nurse at what was then Lakeland General Hospital.

Betty Scalf received a call saying that her daughter, a single mother, had not shown up for work. Betty went to the duplex, used a credit card to open the locked door, and then discovered her daughter’s body.
Judd, with the family’s permission, disclosed that Teresa had been repeatedly stabbed and nearly decapitated. Douglas lived just behind the duplex, Judd said, and PCSO investigators interviewed him and other neighbors at the time but never considered him a suspect.
Judd speculated that Douglas killed Scalf because he sought a sexual relationship with her and she rebuffed him. Family members said Scalf had mentioned “a creepy neighbor” shortly before her death but didn’t name or describe him.
Judd credited Detective Matthew Newbold with leading the effort to resolve the case after receiving it in 2015. Newbold kept a photo of Teresa Scalf on his desk and vowed to her family that he wouldn’t retire until he had identified her killer, Judd said.
“I hope it gives everybody comfort to know that we now know who did this,” said Pam Shade, Teresa’s sister. “We also would like to offer encouragement to other homicide victims — don't give up. They (law enforcement) don't give up. And as long as they don't give up, you don't give up.”

Evidence at the scene suggested that Teresa fought back against her attacker, and PCSO investigators collected blood from her murderer. As technology advanced, the agency entered DNA taken from that blood into the FBI’s national database in the early 2000s but found no matches, meaning the killer’s DNA had not been entered.
Judd said Douglas had never been arrested.
“My prayer is that he had been in mental prison,” Judd said.
Newbold worked with Othram, a Texas company that specializes in developing genetic samples from crime scene evidence. Using publicly available DNA that people submit through such programs as 23andMe, the company helped create a family tree for the murderer, said David Nutting, a company representative who attended the news conference.
It was the 106th publicly announced solution to an unsolved case through Othram’s DNA research, Nutting said. He said there are an estimated 330,000 unsolved murders in the United States.
After identifying Douglas as the murderer, PCSO investigators contacted his son and asked for a DNA sample. He fully cooperated, Judd said, and was “mortified” to learn that his sample confirmed that Donald Douglas’ blood had been found at the scene of Scalf’s murder.
Judd said that detectives originally investigating the case saw no wounds on Douglas and had no reason to suspect him of the killing. Betty Scalf said that heavy rain on the day of the murder washed away evidence and prevented search dogs from being able to find the killer’s trail from the duplex.
Joining Betty Scalf at the news conference were Teresa’s sisters — Shade, 61, and Lynne Scalf, 57. Teresa’s granddaughter, Teresa Wouters, 25, of Winter Haven, stood beside her great-grandmother, holding an arm around her.
Betty Scalf said that Teresa’s son could not attend because of the overwhelming emotion the anniversary brings on.

Family members said they did not know Douglas, who co-owned an electrical company with his brother. Lynne Scalf said she wished Teresa had described the “creepy” neighbor in a way that might have led the investigation to Douglas.
Newbold said investigators found no sign of forced entry at Scalf’s duplex. Betty Scalf said she thinks Douglas entered through a sliding glass door and was waiting for Teresa when she arrived home after finishing her overnight shift and sharing lunch with some co-workers.
Family members praised Judd and Newbold for not giving up on solving the murder. They offered affectionate memories of Teresa Scalf, who rose from an entry role as a phlebotomist to become a respiratory technician and then a registered nurse.
Shade is also a registered nurse and said many family members have gone into medical fields through Teresa’s influence and example.
“The first thing that I would like to say is Teresa was a wonderful person, the most loving person,” Shade said. “She didn't deserve it. Our family didn't deserve this.”
She added: “She started off at the bottom, nursing assistant. She went to respiratory school. She got her RN and was so proud. I've never seen anyone more proud. She said, ‘I did it. Pam, I did it.’ And she was dead a month later, after we had this conversation.”
Shade said that a brother had died in a diving accident only a year and a half before Teresa’s murder.
Lynne Scalf said that learning the identity of her sister’s killer does not bring an end to their grief but does relieve them of suspecting others who knew Teresa.
Betty Scalf, noting that the murder occurred four days before Halloween, said her daughter had promised to take her son out that day to buy a pumpkin for carving and had put a bike on layaway as his Christmas gift.
Lynne Scalf said her sister had two bumper stickers on her car — one urging the adoption of a 911 emergency call system, an idea that had not gained universal acceptance at the time, and the other saying, “Don’t take your organs to heaven. Heaven knows we need them here.”
The manner of Teresa’s death, and the delay of about 10 hours before her body was found, prevented her from having her organs harvested for donation.
“But she was the kind of person that if you asked her about something, she would engage in dialogue,” Lynne said. “So hopefully that encouraged some people to consider that pathway.”

Dolly Parton has always been a backwoods Barbie.
Growing up in a one-room cabin with 11 siblings, the Tennessee native learned at an early age that she could stand out through her music and the way she dressed. She made lipstick from crushed pokeberries, used burnt matchsticks as eyeliner and gave her preacher grandpa conniptions with the tight sweaters and short skirts she’d wear to school.
“I was a colorful kid in a lot of ways,” Parton says. “I loved bright colors, and I still do. Through the years, I just wore what I felt matched my personality.”

Now, she’s tracing her fashion evolution in a new memoir “Behind the Seams: My Life in Rhinestones,” published Tuesday (Penguin Random House). The book begins with her iconic coat of many colors, which her mother stitched together from old fabric scraps. She then recalls her move to Nashville, where she was told she’d never be taken seriously if she didn’t tone down her “trashy” style.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
But the singer didn’t back down. In fact, “I just kept getting bigger and bigger and worse and worse with my look,” she jokes.
Parton, 77, tells USA TODAY about plastic surgery, her classic song "Jolene" at 50, and why it's "scary" being so beloved.
Question: In the book, you revisit some of your most memorable album covers, including "Here You Come Again" (1977). How did you land on that outfit?
Answer: You usually have about four different looks before you do an album cover and you just pick the one that looks the best. We just stayed with the blue jeans and red shirt because that color combo really popped!
Before you released the title track, there was some concern it would be "too pop" for your country fans. (It went on to hit No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.)
It’s a good song; that was my first main-selling record. Everybody said I was making a mistake, so I was just praying, “Lord, please don’t let me be a flop. Let me have a hit record.” And the Lord was good! That was really my big start toward a bigger career.
Speaking of incredible album covers, there's also "Backwoods Barbie" (2008). How do you feel now that Barbie is all the rage? Are people just finally catching up to Dolly?
Well, Barbie was around long before I was (famous)! But with “Backwoods Barbie,” I thought, “Well, I am just a Backwoods Barbie: too much makeup, too much hair.” I was really happy when the “Barbie” movie did so good! I’ve always loved pink and the Barbie Doll, and that was a great little movie. So yeah, I’m still the Backwoods Barbie.
You write in your book that you “wake up with new dreams every day." What are some of your new dreams today?
I’m working on my life story as a musical on Broadway. I've written or chosen all the music that will go into it, and I’ve co-written the script too. So all my spare time, I’m spending on that. That’s been a dream of mine for years and years – at least 20 years I’ve been trying to put that together. I was just about to have it ready when COVID hit and Broadway shut down. Then I thought, “Well, maybe I’ll do it as a biopic,” and wrote up a script for that. But then I was like, “Nah, everybody’s doing a biopic! I’m going back to Broadway now that it’s open.” So I’m hoping to have my show (there) in spring of 2025. That’s my aim!
You also write, “Not everybody’s supposed to look like a movie star. You should be comfortable in your own skin, no matter how far it stretches.” When did you make that realization for yourself?
I think I’ve always been (confident). That started out as a joke: I was referring to plastic surgery, and how I’ve done those nips and tucks. I always think of myself as a workhorse that looks like a show horse, and I’ve got to keep that show horse up. So I do whatever it takes. The same with clothes: I really do think that fashion is not just what’s fashionable. True fashion is what you’re most comfortable in. If you’re going to be motivated and motivating, you need to feel comfortable in what you wear. If you think you look good, you’re going to do better. You’re going to be more apt to step forward and be assertive.
'I had the perfect song':Dolly Parton wanted Tina Turner for her new 'Rockstar' album
This week marks 50 years since "Jolene" was first released. Did you ever hear from the flirty bank teller who inspired it?
Yeah, I saw her recently and she was big as a barn! (Laughs.) No, actually, it wasn't as severe as I made the song. I was just a little jealous that she was prettier than me, so you always feel a little threatened when that happens. But it was not a big deal ‒ it was just good for a song, let's put it that way. And I was only joking about seeing her.
You write in your book that "you sometimes see yourself in strange places." Aside from a Tennessee license plate, where's the weirdest place you've seen your likeness?
In a drag show! (Laughs.) I’m big with the drag queens. Every now and then, I’ll get these videos (of Dolly lookalikes). I’ve also seen myself on those Duncan Hines cake boxes in the supermarket. I’ve signed so many of those boxes – I’ve now signed more cake mixes than I have photos through the years.
Well, I don't know a single person who has a bad thing to say about Dolly Parton. How do you feel about your status as an icon?
It’s a little scary sometimes; I hope I can live up to all of that! But I think a lot of it is that I’ve been around for so long. I’m like a favorite aunt, or a favorite godmother, or a favorite sister. I’ve been around so long that people just think of me as part of the family! I’ve just been a fixture in their lives. I like that I’m part of that – I just hope I never let anybody down. I ain’t as important as some of you make me sound!

A financial analyst who was fired by Citibank for allegedly lying about meal expenses lost a wrongful dismissal lawsuit filed in a London court against the large bank.
Former analyst Szabolcs Fekete sued Citibank last year after he was fired for gross misconduct when he claimed he was the only one who consumed two coffees, two sandwiches, and two pasta dishes during a work trip to Amsterdam.
According to court documents, when Fekete was asked about the expenses in an email in July 2022, he said he had "checked the receipt and did not see anything out of order… I was on the business trip by myself and I had 2 coffees as they were very small."
Fekete later admitted his partner, who was not a Citibank employee, was on the trip with him and shared the meals with him.
He added that he was well within the company's 100 euro expense limit and doesn't think he has to "justify" his eating habits to "this extent.”

The financial analyst claimed he was going through personal issues and was on strong medications when he sent the emails.

Employment Judge Caroline Illing ruled in favor of Citibank last month. Illing said the dismissal was fair because Fekete was not initially honest about the expenses.
"In considering the substantial merits of this case, I have found that this case is not about the sums of money involved," Illing said.
"It is significant that the claimant did not make a full and frank disclosure at the first opportunity and that he did not answer questions directly."

Illing said the bank “requires a commitment to honesty from its employees.”
“I have accepted that the expense report may have been submitted in error,” the judge said. “However, I am satisfied that a dismissal in relation to the misrepresentation allegation alone would fall within the band of a reasonable response by a reasonable employer.”
In a statement to USA TODAY a Citibank spokesperson said the company was "pleased with the decision."
There are moments in a league's history when they are clearly on the wrong side of it. When they make a decision that isn't just foolish but morally wrong. This is where the NHL is right now.
The NHL recently sent a memo to its teams clarifying what players are allowed to do during theme celebrations this season. One of the actions it took was ban the use of rainbow-colored stick tape for Pride Nights. Pride Nights, unbelievably, have become a controversial issue in the league.
The guidance doesn't solely apply to Pride. It also states that on-ice player uniforms and gear for games, warmups and official team practices can't be altered to reflect theme nights, including Pride, Hockey Fights Cancer or military appreciation celebrations. Players can participate in themed celebrations off the ice if they choose.
To be clear, NHL teams will still have Pride Nights, but this represents a chipping away at the advance the NHL has made in recent years in backing the LGBTQ community and players.
So why did the NHL do this? The league, I believe, is trying to satisfy a strong anti-LGBTQ element that exists in professional hockey (and across some other sports) and also among the fans who watch the sport. They could have easily just done nothing. That's what makes this action so reprehensible.
Putting rainbow-colored tape on the blade of a stick is a meaningful gesture and show of support for members of the LGBTQ community both inside and outside of the sport. The fact the NHL won't even allow this small move says a great deal about what the NHL thinks about LGBTQ players.
You don't need to take my word for it about the wrongness of this decision. Listen to the players, former executives and others who say the same.
One of the stars of the league, Edmonton's Connor McDavid, expressed his disappointment in the NHL's decision:
Said former NHL executive Brian Burke: "This is not inclusion or progress. Fans look to teams and the league to show they are welcome, and this directive closes a door that's been open for the last decade. Make no mistake, this is a surprising and serious setback."
Burke, on X, formerly known as Twitter, made one of the more important points about why the NHL did this. It was to appeal to the few people who don't want the league to be inclusive.
"This decision has stripped clubs of a powerful community outreach tool and removed meaningful support for special Initiatives, all to protect a select few who do not want to answer any questions about their choices. I hope the NHL reconsiders in order to remain a leader in DEI."
"You’ll probably see me with the Pride tape on that night," said Philadelphia's Scott Laughton. "I don’t know, I didn’t read really what it said, if it’s a ban or something, but I’ll probably have it on.
"We’ll see what they say, but it’s not gonna affect the way I go about it. If they want to say something, they can."
And while the NHL union, as far as I can tell, has remained silent, the Professional Women's Hockey League Players Association, headed by Burke, has not:
Neither did the Alphabet Sports Collective, which pushes for a safe and inclusive environment in hockey for all people:
The You Can Play Project, which advocates for LGBTQ participation in sports and has worked extensively with the NHL, said in a statement: "If Hockey is for Everyone, this is not the way forward."
"It is now clear that the NHL is stepping back from its longstanding commitment to inclusion, and continuing to unravel all of its one-time industry-leading work on 2SLGBTQ+ belonging," the organization said. "We are now at a point where all the progress made, and relationships established with our community, is in jeopardy. Making decisions to eradicate our visibility in hockey — by eliminating symbols like jerseys and now Pride Tape — immediately stunts the impact of bringing in more diverse fans and players into the sport."
Then, there were the actual makers of the tape:
I know what some of you are going to say.
Let the players do what they want. Don't force "their" lifestyle on everyone. This is America. Freedom. Apple pie. Etc.
But the NHL knows better. The league knows it's not about any of that. The league is doing this out of fear with a select few, as Burke said, making these decisions to appeal to anti-LGBTQ forces, and those people making the decisions aren't standing in front of the cameras and answering questions on why. They won't because they're cowards.
This story is about inclusion, of course, but in some ways it's about something simpler: decency. The NHL had a moment to be decent. It could have fought the uglier base instincts that rule us all. They didn't. They caved.
And this is why the NHL is on the wrong side of history.
The Carolina Reaper has been officially dethroned as the world’s hottest chilli pepper. 
PuckerButt Pepper Company founder and pepper expert Ed Currie has spent the last ten years working on Pepper X, a chilli pepper that emits an “immediate and brutal heat,” according to reporting by the Associated Press.
Five of those years were spent proving Pepper X was a different plant with a different fruit and documenting its average heat over different plants and generations.
“We covered the genetics, we covered the chemistry, we covered the botany,” Currie shared.
Pepper X, which has a rating of 2,693,000 Scoville Heat Units was named hottest chili pepper in the world by Guinness World Records on Oct. 9. 
The heat of the pepper lingered with Currie hours after he completed his initial taste test. 
“I was feeling the heat for three-and-a-half hours. Then the cramps came. Those cramps are horrible. I was laid out flat on a marble wall for approximately an hour in the rain, groaning in pain,” Currie shared with the AP.  
The greenish-yellow Pepper X has an earthy flavor unlike the spicy-sweet taste found in the bright red Carolina Reaper. Pepper X was crossbred with a Carolina Reaper and a pepper from Michigan that is “brutally hot,” Currie said.

Currie chose to unveil Pepper X on “Hot Ones,” a YouTube talk show where celebrities are interviewed over an assortment of spicy chicken wings.  
He was joined by the show’s host Sean Evans, Claus Pilgaard “Chili Klaus” and Noah Chaimberg from Heatonist, the hot sauce company that partners with Hot Ones to source their hot cause lineup. 
Currie talks all things Pepper X, receives his Guinness World Records plaque and facilitates a Pepper X taste test to end the video. 
“There’s an intense burn that happens immediately. Then your head kind of feels like ‘Oh, no. What’s going on?’ Then your body just starts reacting. You get it in your arms. You get it in your chest. It has no real throat burn like the Reaper but that comes on later when you are in pain,” Currie says in the video.
The Scoville scale measures the spiciness of chilli peppers numerically based on the pepper’s capsaicin concentration, which causes a burning sensation when it comes into contact with human tissue, according to Guinness.
The burning sensation produced by capsaicin also releases endorphins and dopamine into the body, AP reported.
Currie, who began to grow peppers after overcoming substance abuse addictions, says the kick from the peppers is akin to a natural high.
He has shared his inventions with medical professionals in the hopes of helping people who suffer from chronic pain or discomfort.
Currie has hinted at the possibility of pepper hybrids much hotter than Pepper X, but has kept his cards close to the vest. 
“Is this the pinnacle?” Currie said of Pepper X, a mischievous smile warming his face. “No, it’s not the pinnacle,” AP reported. 
Winthrop University in South Carolina spent the last four years conducting tests on specimens to determine Pepper X’s Scoville score. 
Here’s how Pepper X compares to other chilli peppers: 
Contrary to popular belief, the seeds of a pepper don’t make it hot. Capsaicin is held in the placenta, or the tissue that holds the seeds.  
Peppers aren’t the only thing that have a Scoville score, pepper spray has a score of 1.6 M SHU while bear spray has a score of 2.2M SHU, respectively, the AP reported.

DENVER — It’s difficult to overstate how good the 2024 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray is, or what an important step it constitutes for America’s great sports car. Now, maybe the world’s great sports car. Performance, design, technology, value: It’s hard to think of an area where the E-Ray isn't at least among the leaders.
All-wheel drive and hybrid-powered, the E-Ray is the biggest leap of imagination and engineering in the Corvette’s 70-year history. Ferrari 296 GTB, Audi R8, Porsche 911, McLaren Artura, Acura NSX, Nissan GT-R, Corvette. Take your pick. You’ll never get a consensus, but that’s the point: Each car is as good as it gets. The fun is in the debate, specifications, lap times and unforgettable road trips.
The ‘Vette’s last evolution, from front engine/rear-wheel drive to mid-engine for the 2020 model year, was child’s play by comparison. Chevy engineers had been kicking around proposals for mid- and rear-engine models for decades. That was a question of when, not if.
Building an electrified — not electric, there’s a difference; the E-Ray is a hybrid that combines a classic small-block V8 driving the rear wheels with an electrically powered front axle — ‘Vette with all-wheel drive was a choice dictated by physics and advances in engineering. Locating the engine's weight over the rear wheels improves traction. Powering the front axle with a small, efficient electric motor provides instant torque and precise control.
The program began before and was separate from the Ultium electric motors and batteries GM developed for 100% electric vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq, and Chevy Silverado EV pickup. It’s also unrelated to the inexpensive Chevy Bolt.
The E-Ray was part of the plan for the eighth generation C8 model from the start. That’s why its lithium-ion battery fits tidily in the center tunnel, and why the front electric motor and reworked steering and suspension don’t reduce space in the car’s front trunk.

The E-Ray’s bodywork is virtually identical to the Corvette Z06, with the exception of name badges and a logo that adds a pair of openings — opinion varies as to whether they’re eyes or gills — to the stylized stingray’s dorsal surface. The E-Ray is 3 inches wider than a Stingray, with staggered 20- and 21-inch wheels.
Chevy explains the distinction between the two models thus:
The E-Ray is faster 0-60 mph — if the difference between its 2.5 seconds and the Z06’s 2.6, as measured by Chevrolet, is a deal breaker for you. The track-ready Z06 covers a standing quarter-mile in 10.6 seconds and hits 130 mph, while the E-Ray slouches through it in 10.5 and 129 mph. Of such distinctions are buying decisions made, particularly when you’re dealing with some of the most passionate and informed car buyers on Earth.
If you haven’t been keeping up with “Planet Earth” on BBC, the name E-Ray is a riff on ‘Vette’s stingray heritage: There’s also an electric ray, a sleek sea creature that generates up to 220 volts to defend itself or stun prey.
Getting the front axle’s electric motor and the rear wheels’ 6.2L V8 to work together seamlessly at thousands of revolutions per minute — while simultaneously diving into curves and managing inputs from the steering system, eight-speed transmission and Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes — was one of the most daunting challenges GM engineers have tackled. And remember, this is the company that developed Lunar Rovers for the Apollo program.
“It’s the most complicated consumer product you can buy,” Corvette executive chief engineer Tadge Juechter told me as he pointed out details of the exposed mechanicals in a cutaway E-Ray in an airport hangar outside Denver. “Electrification increases the driver’s feeling of control and composure in all conditions.”
The E-Ray’s sensors also interpret steering angle and pedal inputs to determine the driver’s intent and keep the car on course and at speed. The electric all-wheel drive system dispenses torque for secure traction accelerating out of curves.
The 6.2L V8 engine produces 495 hp that go to the rear wheels, via the same eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that powers all current Corvettes. An electric motor located under the front trunk delivers another 160 hp.
There’s no physical connection between the two drivetrains, which must operate in harmony at all speeds, road surfaces and conditions.
The Acura NSX, which ended production last year, was the only other supercar with independently powered front and rear ends. Its front wheels are driven by two separate electric motors. A turbocharged V6 and electric motor power the rear. The NSX developed 600 hp and accelerated to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds. Prices started at $169,500.

I found the E-Ray remarkably easy to drive over two days that included highways, twisting mountain roads north of Denver and a tight slalom course at Pikes Peak International Raceway, 90 miles south of the city.
The power comes on with smooth precision, the steering is responsive and neutral, the ride surprisingly comfortable over bumps.
An adaptive magnetic ride suspension kept the car level in fast launches and hard braking, and firmly planted in fast maneuvers, including a tire-smoking drifting session the E-Ray could have maintained until the the tread fell off or the tank ran dry.
Speaking of running without gasoline, the electric front axle provides a "stealth mode," with speeds up to 45 mph when leaving home or driving through the neighborhood.
The electric motor also extends the V8’s four-cylinder operating mode on the highway, reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The 655-hp E-Ray avoided the gas-guzzler tax, scoring the same 19 mpg EPA rating in combined city and highway driving as a 490-hp, gasoline-only Stingray.
The E-Ray’s weight distribution is 42% over the front axle, 58% over the rear, a couple of percentage points more over the nose than the base ‘Vette, but “still in the sweet spot’” for acceleration and handling, Juechter said.

Interest in bodybuilding has skyrocketed since the pandemic began. Searches for "bodybuilding" or "weightlifting" apps have grown by over 190% year over year, according to Google Trends data. Among the most popular bodybuilding gym exercises that people seek out are squats, dumbbells and deadlifts. But one analysis shows that by far the most popular weightlifting exercise – among both men and women – is the bench press. 
The bench press is such a sought-after piece of gym equipment because the workout produces the kind of results bodybuilders are after, it's a straightforward exercise that's easy to do and because it offers a host of other health benefits beyond muscle growth alone.
Like many forms of resistance training, the bench press requires the use of some basic gym equipment. These include a workout bench to lay back on, a long barbell that sits atop a secure rack frame on both sides of the bench, and weight plates of varying poundage that are added to each side of the barbell in equal amounts and then secured with clips at each end. 
Once the right equipment is in place, getting the most out of the exercise requires good form. Jackie Miller, a certified IRONMAN and USA Triathlon coach who has been advising athletes for 18 years, says the trick to proper bench press form is sticking to the following steps: 
"Once you feel fatigue such as muscle burn or feeling overly tired, it's time to rack the weight," says Melanie Adams, an American College of Sports Medicine certified exercise physiologist and a professor of exercise science at Keene State College in New Hampshire.
Done properly, the exercise works several muscle groups, but its primary target is the pectoralis major, often called pecs. "This is the large, fan-shaped muscle on top of our ribs and over our chest," says Adams. She explains that the job of these chest muscles is to help move one's shoulders and control movement of both arms across the front of the body.
The bench press works other muscles, too. "The triceps get some good stress as well as the exercise extends the elbow," Adams explains. So do assisting muscles such as deltoids, biceps, forearm muscles, rib muscles, "and the latissimus dorsi, which stabilize the wrist and shoulder blades."
The exercise is also unique because it can be adjusted to target each muscle group more extensively.
Lifting from an inclined workout bench will target one's upper chest muscles, while decline bench-pressing movements will target one's lower chest muscles, explains Dr. Matthew Best, director of research in the sports medicine division at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. At either setting, however, "it's important to avoid trying to lift too much weight or performing the exercise too rapidly, which can predispose to injury," he adds.
More on squats:Squat challenges are all over social media. What muscles does the exercise work?
Beyond increased upper-body strength in each of these muscle groups, bench pressing has other health benefits as well. These include improved stamina and endurance, increased mobility and some research shows that the exercise can also increase bone density.
Performing the exercise also partly satisfies the physical activity recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For optimal health and strength, the agency recommends 75 to 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity each week in addition to muscle strengthening activities at least twice a week. 
Maintaining such levels of physical activity, the CDC notes, can improve one's brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease and improve one's ability to do everyday activities. "Many people are initially interested in weightlifting to increase muscle size, but quickly learn our muscles are involved in all kinds of hormonal interactions like lowering inflammation, stopping stress response and growing brain cells," explains Adams. "Building both muscular endurance and muscular strength throughout the body pays off for your health."

WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden plans to travel to Israel on Wednesday in a dramatic display of support for the U.S. ally as his administration seeks to prevent the Israel-Hamas war from expanding into a larger Middle East conflict.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is currently in Tel Aviv, announced Biden's visit following an overnight meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
"He's coming here at a critical moment for Israel, for the region and for the world," Blinken said.
The trip will come a week and a half after Hamas' surprise attack on Israel killed at least 1,300 Israelis, prompting airstrikes on Gaza in retaliation. The death toll on both sides of the war has surpassed 4,000 − about 2,800 in Gaza − and more than 10,000 are wounded. Blinken said at least 30 Americans were killed in Israel.
Blinken said Biden "will again make clear, as he's done unequivocally," that Israel "has the right and indeed the duty to defend its people" following the Hamas attack.
Biden will travel to Tel Aviv, where he will hold a bilateral meeting with Netanyahu and meet with other Israeli officials.
Blinken said Biden will hear from Israeli leaders about what it needs from the U.S. to defend itself. The White House is seeking approval from Congress to provide military aid to Israel.
Israel has advised Palestinians in northern Gaza to head south ahead of a ground offensive, prompting concerns that other Middle East adversaries could join the conflict.
"President Biden will underscore our crystal-clear message to any actor, state, or non-state trying to take advantage of this crisis to attack Israel. Don't," Blinken said.
Biden has publicly warned other parties hostile to Israel – terrorist groups and other nations - not to use the Israel-Hamas War as a moment to interfere and expand the conflict.
Biden singled out Iran by name last week, saying he “made it clear to the Iranians: Be careful.”
But Iranian leaders warned Monday that an expanded Israel-Hamas War is increasingly becoming unavoidable, a sign that the primary backer of the Palestinian militant group Hamas is preparing for a larger conflict.
“The time for political solutions is running out," Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, adding that "the possibility of expanding the scope of the war on other fronts is approaching the stage that cannot be avoided."
Iran is allies with Hamas but the Biden administration has so far said it found no evidence that Iran either knew about the attack on Israel or helped Hamas carry it out.
Biden canceled a previously scheduled trip Monday to Pueblo, Colorado, where he planned to tout his administration's efforts to expand wind turbines, as the administration scrambled to arrange the Israel visit.
John Kirby, a White House spokesman for national security issues, said Biden will "affirm our solidarity with Israel, and he will look forward to getting an update from Israeli officials about their strategy and the pace of their military operations."
Biden will also talk to Israel about the hostages who are being held by Hamas and will discuss coordinating efforts to get Americans back home, Kirby said.
Asked whether it's safe for Biden to travel to the region, Kirby said, “We wouldn't make a trip, obviously, if we did not believe that proper security measures would be in place.”
Also on Wednesday, Biden will travel to Amman, Jordan, where he will meet with King Abdullah II, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abba. Biden will reiterate his concern that Hamas does not represent the vast majority of the Palestinian people, and he will discuss the humanitarian needs of all civilians in Gaza, Kirby said.

Editor's note: Part one of a five-part USA TODAY series revealing why America hasn't solved its long struggle with Type 2 diabetes.
For chef Robin Ray, newly married with young stepchildren, the turning point came when a stabbing chest pain sent her rushing to the emergency room. 
For Brian Castrucci, the gravity hit when the ER doc who had treated him for a near-heart attack a few weeks earlier gave him a big bear hug. “I didn’t think you’d make it,” the doctor said.
The crisis unspooled more slowly for James Haynes but started in 2019 when he stepped on a rusty nail and didn’t notice. 
The moments were turning points for all three to get serious about addressing their diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can’t properly regulate blood sugar, has become so common it’s almost considered inconsequential. More than 1 in 10 Americans have the disease (though many don't know) and another nearly 4 in 10 are at risk for it. In total, half of all adults and a quarter of teenagers have diabetes or pre-diabetes.
Its financial costs are astronomical. The country spends more than $300 billion a year to address diabetes, accounting for $1 out of every $4 spent on health care. 
And its personal tolls are even worse: heart attacks, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, double the risk of premature death. It also causes what’s known as “diabetes distress,” the daily burdens and emotional toll of living with and managing a chronic ailment that can lead to regular dips in energy, foggy thinking and depression, and a sense of isolation.
The most frustrating aspect of Type 2 diabetes, experts say, is that it has long been largely preventable and controllable. 
“We have made tremendous gains in understanding diabetes,” said Dr. Donald Berwick, a pediatrician and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “The best diabetes care can make a very big difference. You can’t say we don’t know what to do.”
And yet, diagnosed rates of Type 2 diabetes have soared over the past 25 years, and especially over the past dozen – particularly among working-age adults like Ray, Castrucci and Haynes. 
Roughly 40% of people who died early in the coronavirus pandemic had Type 2 diabetes, a rate four times higher than people without the disease. Even when elevated blood sugar levels are below the threshold for type 2 diabetes, the risk for heart disease jumps 30% to 50% compared with people with normal blood sugar levels. (Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 5% to 10% of diabetes, is caused by the immune system and is unrelated to diet or lifestyle.)
America’s failure to address Type 2 diabetes highlights larger problems with our food and medical systems, Berwick and other experts said.
A soda costs less than a bottle of water, a double cheeseburger and fries less than a carton of blueberries. Patients wait months for medical appointments only to see the back of a white coat for the short time they’re allotted. Treating disease costs society far more than preventing it but typically provides more profit for insurance companies, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry.
The USA TODAY Health team spoke with scores of health care providers, researchers, community leaders and patients for this five-part series to understand why Type 2 diabetes continues to worsen in America despite known solutions.
The answer isn't simple. It involves systemic problems facing everyone in society, not just those with diabetes: a food system designed to sell products; a medical system in which cutting off a leg is less expensive than saving it; the high cost of healthy living and the fact that breaking habits takes a lot more than just personal willpower.
This first story looks at what it takes for people to cope with or overcome the disease.
Then, we explore one community in a David vs. Goliath battle against a food system that fails to prioritize people's health.
More in series:Diabetes runs deep in rural Mississippi. Locals have taken to growing their own solutions.
We next travel to Colorado, which has the lowest level of diabetes in the nation. Yet even in this state, where hiking trails and gorgeous views abound, economic and other disparities make it easier for some people to avoid diabetes than others.

Finally, we explore solutions, addressing why it will take a combination of education, medication, medical devices and improved food access to solve this national problem.
More in series:Solutions exist to end the Type 2 diabetes dilemma but too few get the help they need
The system is fixable, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.
But it will take "sensible action" from across many sectors, including health care, science, nutrition, business, public health and politics to change the financial and other incentives that drive so many Americans toward sickness instead of health.
"If we do it all, we could fix a lot of this in 10 years," said Mozaffarian, who serves on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. "If we do it incrementally or don't do it at all, we're all going to be toast in 50 years from diet-related illnesses and a depleted environment."
There’s no question personal responsibility plays a role in fighting diabetes. 
Haynes, Ray and Castrucci radically changed their lifestyles and sought help after their come-to-Jesus experiences. They’ve reduced their dependence on daily medication and hope to have saved themselves the horrors of more amputations, blindness and dialysis. They’ve extended their lives and improved the quality of that time.
But like many medical problems, the challenges of diabetes go well beyond individual responsibility and blame. 
“There are structural issues that we have to start paying attention to and addressing,” said Dr. Shivani Agarwal, an endocrinologist who specializes in research and treating young adults with diabetes at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Agarwal recently led a series of studies in the journal The Lancet that looked at diabetes rates around the world. 
Poverty, the studies showed, was a major driver of diabetes, along with racism and unequal access to healthy food and high-quality medical care.
Personal stories illustrate how these structural issues play out in the lives of so many Americans.
Ray, 45, director of culinary operations at HOSCO/North Sarah Food Hub in St. Louis, got weight-loss surgery and then put her culinary expertise to good use.  
Castrucci, 49, who runs a public health nonprofit outside Washington, D.C., used his advantages provided by his work, salary and insurance to “buy” himself better health.
 “I’m healthy because of privilege – not diet, not exercise, not determination,” he said.
Haynes, 58, a former truck driver and maintenance technician in Gulfport, Mississippi, has fewer material assets, but his attitude and the advantages he does have explain why he's still around, despite all he has been through.
“It’s going to be all right after a while, as long as I keep this spirit,” he said.
Ray’s love for food began when she was 8 years old, watching Julia Child on TV. During family gatherings, she would run around taking everyone’s dinner order. Then she’d scurry back to the kitchen with a notepad full of scribbles. 
Throughout her life, she made fried chicken, pork chops, baked mac and cheese, collard greens, and even a whole roasted chicken filled with wild rice and two sticks of butter – everything that made her soul sing. 
In her world, food was home. Food was family. Food was love. 
But that was some pretty tough love. 
In 2002, Ray was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Her father, grandmother, aunts and uncles all had diabetes. She knew what it meant.
“For you to tell me I can’t have ice blue raspberry Kool-Aid was like you shut down my world,” Ray said. “I didn’t want to accept it. So, I ate, because you eat through your emotions.” 
She didn't dwell on the diagnosis and continued with life. Her culinary career took her to Italy, where she learned and fell even more in love with food. She returned to St. Louis, got married and became a mom to her husband’s two children ‒ “beautiful bonus babies,” as she described them. Through the years, she continued to express love through cooking and eating. 
In 2015, a stabbing chest pain sent her to the emergency room. Doctors assured Ray she hadn’t had a heart attack, but they warned that her life was on the line. At 5-foot-2, she weighed 334 pounds and had an A1C, a measure of average blood sugar of 11%, well above the 6.5% cutoff to be considered diabetic. Her diabetes – and her diet – were out of control. 
“That scared me. … It was gut-wrenching and terrifying,” she said. “I’m fighting against something that’s fighting me back and I did not know how to win.” 
She and her primary care doctor decided she would pursue weight loss surgery. 
But she also decided to use her culinary prowess to transform her diet. She reconfigured favorite foods, substituting healthier ingredients: Collard greens cooked in smoked fats or ham hocks turned into a kale, turnip and rutabaga recipe flavored with natural chicken broth fat, oils and seasonings. 
She fostered her feelings into new recipes and brought them to North Sarah Food Hub, which partnered with Barnes-Jewish Hospital to make packaged, pre-made meals for St. Louis residents with diabetes and limited access to fresh food.
“I had to restructure the food that I put in my mouth. I had to think about what I was eating and how I was eating and how it was going to be good for my body,” she said. “I became excited about food again, and food became a joy.” 
It isn’t always easy, of course. Ray admits to an occasional cookie craving. But now she takes the time to think about how her body processes that cookie and whether it’s worthwhile. 
She hopes her cooking can help other people make the same transformation she did. Her staff at North Sarah helps her create new recipes for others. She wants to provide nourishment that allows people to avoid illness and medicine. 
“Nobody wants to take 55 pills, nobody wants to feel like a patient, but how do you fix that? It’s by our food,” she said. “That should be what we’re teaching our community and our culture and our children. … It’s not always about the macaroni noodle with a smile, it’s about what’s good for your body.” 
Castrucci is a third-generation diabetes patient. The lifetime risk of developing Type 2 diabetes if a parent has it is 40%. If both parents have it, the risk jumps to 70%.
He knew he was at risk, but he pushed his luck, he said, by eating poorly during the pandemic and falling out of his exercise routine. With the luxury of working from home, walking to the kitchen and bathroom was often the extent of his daily activity.
On Feb. 14, 2022 – Valentine’s Day – he went to an urgent care clinic, concerned his breathing trouble meant he had bronchitis. His blood pressure measured 210 over 110, well above normal levels that top out at 120 over 80. A chest X-ray showed fluid filling his lungs, leading to congestive heart failure. 
The clinic sent him straight to a local emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a blockage of the left descending artery – a clogged artery made worse by diabetes. If he had waited any longer, he would have had a massive heart attack, his doctor later told him.
After his release from the hospital, he went to the drugstore to fill his new prescriptions. The pharmacist told him she couldn’t fill one because it would cost $1,000. He’d have to wait until his insurance approved it. “Please fill it,” he said. She stressed the cost. “Fill it,” he pleaded, putting the charge on his credit card.
Medication helped him lose 70 pounds in three months. When his local drugstore ran out of the weight-loss drug, he easily drove to another pharmacy and then another to find what he needed. 
His 100 hours of high-quality cardiac rehabilitation were fully covered by insurance.  
"For my midlife crisis, I got healthy," Castrucci said.
He could devote all his energy to getting well because he didn’t have to focus on how to afford his care. “(I) paid almost nothing for the whole episode,” he said, “and never worried about it because I have really good insurance.” 
Even so, Castrucci pays out-of-pocket for a cardiologist and an endocrinologist because the best ones near him don’t accept insurance.
Every time he goes to Walgreens to refill his medications, Castrucci said, he sees someone turned away because they can’t afford their prescriptions. When they finally show up in the emergency room, “because they will,” they will cost the system far more, he said.
“Health outcomes are dictated by economics. It’s a whole side of privilege that we don’t always talk about.”
On the day Haynes stepped on a rusty nail in 2019, he walked all day as the nail pierced the sole of his sneaker and then his foot. By the time he took off his shoe that night, his foot was infected. He landed in the hospital for two months as doctors and nurses tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to get the infection and Haynes’ blood sugar under control.
By the time he was released, he knew enough about Type 2 diabetes to realize his daily blood sugar levels – typically in the mid-400s – were four times above what he had been told to shoot for.
But nothing he did or ate seemed to make a difference. He had long since traded ribs for salads, beer for water. 
His wife, Angela, barely noticed when James started wearing multiple pairs of socks, pouring powder on his feet and buying bigger shoes. His feet tingled a lot, he said, but he was coping with it. 
James ended up in the emergency room again, dehydrated and in need of antibiotics. The doctor amputated the baby toe on his right foot, leaving a large open wound. 
"We're going to leave this open because we'll probably have to take more,” Angela remembered the doctor saying. “I didn't like that we're not going to try to save anything, we're just going to start cutting.”
James was fading.
His arm muscles shriveled and he lost his Popeye physique. Antibiotics left him looking sickly, his voice so weak Angela could barely hear him. “I felt like I was watching my husband slowly dying,” she said.
Finally, taking her doctor sister’s advice, Angela emailed Dr. Foluso Fakorede’s office to ask for an appointment. She thought it would take months to get James in to see the heart disease specialist, but the office called and asked if they could come the next day. 
The Hayneses would end up going back to see Fakorede many times − sometimes twice in one week, driving more than five hours each way from Gulfport north to Cleveland, Mississippi.
“We started looking forward to these visits because there was always hope,” Angela Haynes said, though she felt guilty they were taking up so much of the important doctor’s time. 
Fakorede, who is on a personal mission to save people with diabetes from amputations, noticed what other doctors had missed. Haynes had blockages in blood vessels on both legs. 
Once he got the blood flowing again, Haynes began to feel better. His flesh returned to its normal color. The wound started healing at last. Walking became easier.
Then disaster struck again. 
On July 2, 2022, Haynes caught COVID-19. "Everything went downhill after that," he said.
During his 13-day illness, the bacteria in his foot raged out of control. He ended up back in the hospital and unable to withstand the long drive to Fakorede’s office.
Every week, a surgeon would come to the door of his hospital room and before even stepping all the way in ask Haynes whether he had decided to get his leg amputated. 
"This is my leg. I was born with this. And you're walking in like you're cutting a piece of cake," Haynes said.
He was worried about how he’d get around, how he’d be able to work to support his family if he had only one leg. No one took the time to explain why they thought the leg needed to come off or how he’d cope without it, Haynes said. 
In late November, he was finally sent home in a wheelchair. But just three weeks later, as he was getting out of the car after wound care, his right leg gave out and he fell to the ground. Back at the hospital, Haynes was told his foot was broken, essentially beyond repair. He agreed to a below-the-knee amputation.
Released right before Christmas, he spent the next three weeks in bed wondering how he’d manage the rest of his life.
Finally, it looked as if his luck might be turning around.
With the leg gone, his diabetes improved. His blood sugar dropped into the 120s or one-teens. His blurry vision cleared up.
During his long hospital stay, he befriended nurses and learned about a program for people who needed prostheses. The man who ran it called early in the year and said he had received a donated leg. If it fit Haynes, he could have it while waiting for insurance to pay for a personalized one. Miraculously, it did. 
Haynes spent the next six months teaching himself to walk again. The donor leg was heavy and uncomfortable. He wasn't mobile enough to hold down a job.
One late spring night, picking up dinner at a nearby restaurant, he headed to the bathroom for a pit stop. A sink had been leaking all day and Haynes slipped in the puddle, falling backward.
He's still recovering from the resulting wrist surgery.
He and Angela are living – barely – off her part-time salary as a secretary and a church organist.
Haynes has tried "at least three or four times" to receive government assistance, but they keep losing his paperwork, or not believing he's disabled, though he once checked himself out of the hospital and arrived at an appointment in his wheelchair to prove he didn't have a leg.
Still, he clings to his faith and the positive attitude he has long used to cheer up himself and others. These are his secret weapons against diabetes and everything else life throws his way.
"I try to put a smile on other people's faces," he said. "It keeps my day going."

The USA TODAY Best-selling Booklist is back!
After a brief hiatus, USA TODAY’s beloved bestsellers list has returned with the features and characteristics that have long made it the People’s Booklist.
Our goal remains the same: Provide book lovers with the best, most accurate snapshot of what people are reading by showing which titles are selling. It is a master list, unbound by genre and format, of what’s selling broadly across the U.S.
“I am so thrilled that the USA Today Best-selling Booklist is coming back!" says bestselling author Colleen Hoover in a statement. "It gives so many authors the wonderful opportunity to be recognized as bestsellers and for readers to discover their next favorite book.”
Hoover, the self-published writer turned bestselling powerhouse who's authored dozens of novels including "It Ends With Us" and "Verity," was the undisputed queen of the Booklist in 2022 and spent weeks atop the list. Her novel "It Starts With Us" claimed the No. 1 spot in its first week, her highest debut ever, selling more than 800,000 copies on its first day of sales. It was her fourth book to hit No. 1 in 2022.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
The USA TODAY list is a ranking of the top-selling titles each week from a broad range of businesses including major chains, independent bookstores and online retailers. It reflects combined sales of titles in print and electronic format, if available. Our data team weighs and compiles those numbers to generate the week's 150 top-selling titles. The rankings reflect sales from the previous Monday through Sunday. The full list will publish online at 6 a.m. Wednesdays, with the top 50 titles publishing in print Thursdays.
The list, which began in 1993, went on hiatus in December. It is the longest-running USA TODAY data journalism project.
In our continued commitment to bring readers more books coverage, USA TODAY is also excited to announce a new content partnership with The Novel Neighbor, an independently owned and operated bookstore in St. Louis. They are expert booksellers and passionate readers who are deeply connected to what their community is reading. With the partnership will come regular profiles of independent bookstores across the country, highlighting the important role of these businesses in their local communities. Novel Neighbor will also be sharing expert book recommendations and fun takes on book trends.
We can't wait to see what you've been reading!
Israel bombed areas of southern Gaza where it had told Palestinians to flee to ahead of an expected ground invasion, killing dozens of people on Tuesday in retaliatory attacks it says are targeted at Hamas militants that rule the besieged territory, according to the Associated Press.
With no water, fuel or food being delivered to Gaza since Hamas’ brutal attack on Israel last week, mediators struggled to break a deadlock over delivering supplies to increasingly desperate civilians, aid groups and hospitals.
In Gaza, dozens of injured were rushed to hospitals after heavy attacks outside the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, residents reported. Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official and former health minister, reported 27 people were killed in Rafah and 30 in Khan Younis.
There have been conflicting reports regarding the state of affairs at Rafah. Who can pass through is controlled by Hamas and Egypt, however since Israel started attacking Gaza with airstrikes in response to Hamas's attack, operations have been hampered.
Reports that the crossing might be temporarily reopened during a brief lull on Monday, masses gathered at Rafah; however, both Israel and Hamas promptly refuted this.
More than 1 million Gazans had evacuated their homes. Last week Israel ordered an evacuation of northern Gaza, an edict that fueled chaos across the Israeli-occupied territory of about 2.3 million Palestinians.

Israel’s military told some 1 million Palestinians on Friday to evacuate northern Gaza and head to the southern part of the besieged territory, an unprecedented order applying to almost half the population ahead of an expected ground invasion against the ruling Hamas militant group.
The evacuation order, which includes Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, sparked widespread panic among civilians and aid workers already running from Israeli airstrikes and contending with a total siege and a territorywide blackout.
A closed military zone has been created by the Israel Defense Forces surrounding the Gaza Strip. Hamas continues to try to infiltrate the area, though in smaller forces. The border breaches from the initial attack are being rebuilt. There are around 300,000 Israeli soldiers are gathering near the Gaza Strip.
Residential neighborhoods in Gaza City sustained significant damage, as seen in recent satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies.
The Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, a force of six warships headed by the U.S. Navy’s largest and most advanced nuclear aircraft carrier, arrived in the eastern Mediterranean Sea on Tuesday as part of the U.S. response to the attack by Hamas on Israel.

Israel’s defense minister says electricity, food, water and fuel to Gaza will be halted as part of a “complete siege” of the nation.
Israel launched strikes inside Gaza on Monday morning. Several mosques and a marketplace are hit and an unknown number of people are injured. The Yassin Mosque near the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City is among those destroyed.
The Israeli military says it's conducting one of the largest airstrikes ever against Hamas in Gaza and says more than 1,200 targets were hit.
A Hamas spokesperson said Monday the group will kill one civilian hostage each time Israel targets civilians in Gaza without warning.
2:19 a.m. On social media site X, formerly Twitter, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel has destroyed the sites used to launch the rocket attacks.

Israel's Defense Ministry said mortars fired from Gaza hit the Erez border crossing into Israel, used by thousands of Gazans daily. The mortars damaged the roof and shrapnel hit the hall's entrance, the ministry said. The crossing has been closed amid the fighting.
A Hamas official said Saturday that the hostages could be freed in exchange for Palestinian terrorists serving prison sentences in Israel.
More than 1,900 people have died, including at least 14 Americans, and fighting continues after the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched thousands of rockets from Gaza against Israeli cities and sent an estimated 1,000 gunmen across Israel's border to attack and kidnap civilians on Oct. 7.

The coordinated assault, the deadliest attack on Israel in decades, caught the nation and the world by surprise. Israeli Defense Forces responded with airstrikes and rocket attacks against cities inside the Gaza Strip.
Hamas seized dozens of people as hostages from various locations during its attack and has detained them in Gaza. The exact number isn’t known, but the hostages, from Israel and other countries, include “civilians, children and grandmothers,” an IDF spokesperson told CNN.
6:30 a.m.: Hamas launches Operation Al-Aqsa Flood against Israel, firing thousands of rockets from inside the Gaza Strip into Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Rabbi Igael Gurin-Malous grew up in an Orthodox home, spending time in Belgium, Israel and the United States. Today, he's a gay, tattooed, non-denominational rabbi living in New York.
Most of the people he went to Jewish boys school with are right-wing. This week, those same peers bullied him in group chats. They called him a Hebrew word meaning a traitor to the other side. Because he "dared to" suggest that Israel's current military response in Gaza "is not the only way to to address the (Israeli-Palestinian conflict)."
His situation resembles many across the U.S. and rest of the world as people grapple with differing opinions among friends, family and colleagues; A college group text devolving because no one can agree. Millennials walking on eggshells for fear of upsetting their Gen Z partners.
There's no one way to approach sensitive issues of this nature. But experts say those aiming to preserve relationships fractured by the war between Israel and Hamas should tread lightly.
"Reactions like rage and heartbreak are normal," says Kimberly Vered Shashoua, a licensed clinical social worker. "If you’re feeling too overwhelmed with your own emotions, that’s OK. Just let your partner or loved ones know you need some time or space before you are up for having deep conversations."
Emotions have been running high since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7; 4,200 have died on both sides, according to the United Nations.
"It's creating these distances that people feel unseen, unheard, vilified," Gurin-Malous says.
Many have expressed their fears and frustrations on social media in an effort to empathize and seek personal connections to tragedies in lieu of or in addition to private conversations. Maybe to alleviate guilt, to feel like they're doing something, to "perform" uneducated solidarity.
These posts often go awry when people play the comparison game. "The problem is not the desire to find a personal connection," says Benjamin Goldman, licensed mental health counselor. "The problem is when conversations become about comparing degrees of suffering and pain. And during this time that we're in right now, there's a lot of data and a lot of real information." Anyone can throw statistics at a situation to try and justify their points. But many aren't really looking for meaningful conversation
Aziz Abu-Sarah's octogenarian parents live in Jerusalem. He visited them there three weeks ago. Now, he's afraid for their safety. A Palestinian peacemaker, his Israeli and Palestinian friends have been asking him how to broker dialogue.
"My advice was this: refrain (from) political discussions," he says. "Don't talk heavy politics right now. You always do, you will eventually, but now, maybe is not the time to start going into what happened 100 years ago and 50 years ago. This is just the wrong time for that."
Before engaging with someone on as sensitive a topic as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, consider who you are talking to (i.e. where do they fall on the issue) and have a goal in mind. Are you looking to vent? For a dialogue? To change their mind?
Because "if you're looking for a conversation that takes place in a shared experience in pain, and then you go to someone with a conflicting experience from you to have that conversation, you will be hurt," Goldman says. "And they will also probably be hurt." That said, "if you must share information that you feel very strongly about, it’s best to adopt a non-confrontational attitude – even if you believe you are right," says Cecille Ahrens, a licensed clinical social worker.
It may also be worth some introspection. "We would be wise to remember that we are each a product of our own lived experience steeped in the culture that surrounds us," says Laura Petiford, a licensed marriage and family therapist. "Additionally, we are influenced by the media's synthesis of information and the mediums we trust to deliver it to our screens and inboxes."
Focus less on politics and more on the personal if you're aiming for a productive conversation. "Try and connect from a human perspective on fear and isolation, and not being seen, and all the other emotions that we all feel whenever there is war," Gurin-Malous says.
Abu-Sarah adds: "Being vulnerable for each other and being willing to listen, instead of being quick to fight and argue – this is true in all situations."
He suggests focusing less on your position at the start of a dialogue and more on your story: "Before we start taking positions: 'Here why I stand (for Israel's) right to defend itself; here's why I stand for Palestinians' right to end occupation.' Before you say, your position, tell your story. It's more important."
Consider, too, "is there any common ground from which you can start?" asks Regine Galanti, a clinical psychologist. "Can you agree that all civilian deaths are terrible and tragic? That it's not OK to kidnap women and children? That it's terrible for people not to have access to basic utilities? Again, if you have no common ground, it might not be a conversation worth having right now."
You are also allowed to hit pause if you're not ready to talk just yet. "It's OK to avoid conversations with friends or family if you're not  emotionally in the right place for these disagreements," Galanti adds. "I've been muting a lot of my Instagram stories – even of people that I agree with – because I go to Instagram to unwind, and the constant barrage of videos on the Israeli-Gaza conflict make me anxious instead."
Watch out:Israel, Gaza and when your social media posts hurt more than help
Some relationships may not survive disagreements of this nature. And that is OK, too.
For Gurin-Malous, some wounds won't scar. They'll sit as open wounds.
"Some of the damage that has been done to me, and some of the relationships that I have around this, I think are irreparable," he says. "You can't unsay things you've said. And with that, I also want to allow for the fact that this is a very hot button (issue) for everybody involved." Still, "I want to also bring some compassion to the fact that sometimes we say things that we don't mean. And sometimes we out of fear lash out. And it is unfortunate, I think that many, many times, we reserve our worst behavior for the people we love the most."
Remember, as Abu-Sarah says: "Behind every angry statement, behind every talking point we throw at each other, there's a hurt person."

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was able to transport hundreds of people from Israel to Florida just days after announcing an evacuation initiative by tapping into an existing rescue program, Project Dynamo, that likely would have gone forward with the effort regardless of the state’s support.
Florida has paid for five flights to evacuate people out of Israel between Friday and Sunday, including one that landed in Tampa Sunday night with 270 people, but Project Dynamo coordinated everything else, according to the group’s CEO and founder Bryan Stern.
Project Dynamo was founded in 2021 to help rescue people from Afghanistan after American troops withdrew from the country and has conducted missions everywhere from Ukraine to Sudan. The flight to Tampa Sunday was the group’s 602nd evacuation mission.
Stern spoke about the rescue missions during a news conference Monday and said he was raising money to pay for the Tampa flight when the state of Florida stepped in to offer assistance.
“We were fundraising right up until Gov. DeSantis and his office came in… bottom line is we would have figured it out,” Stern said. “We’ve done it six hundred and one times without government help, six hundred and two was not going to be the one that we failed on. But it makes it so much easier when you have backing by a state entity for sure.”
Many commercial flights out of Israel were canceled following a surprise attack by Hamas and subsequent retaliatory measures by Israel. That has left many Americans struggling to find a way out of Israel.
DeSantis declared a state of emergency last week and directed the Florida Division of Emergency Management to coordinate evacuation efforts. The governor, running what now appears to be a longshot campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, was at the Tampa airport Sunday to welcome the evacuees from Israel, which included 269 Americans – including roughly 70 Floridians – and one native of the Czech Republic.
Stern said he was grateful for Florida's financial support, the first time a government agency has funded one of his evacuation efforts, but also made it clear that he would've done everything to get people home safely, regardless of whether Florida funded the effort.
"Would it have been possible? I'll tell you that I wasn't going to leave them behind and I'm not trying to stay in Israel a moment longer than I need to so we would've figured it out, for sure," Stern said.
DeSantis' trip to Tampa on Sunday was “the first time an American politician has ever met us home,” Stern said.
The evacuation flight to Tampa involved gathering people from more than 12 different areas across Israel, Stern said. On the flight were Ron and Linda Neumann, who are trying to become dual citizens of Israel and the United States, and their dog.
The Neumanns have been living in Israel recently, but also live in Melbourne.
Ron Neumann said after two flights out of Israel were canceled he tried to find a way out of the country by contacting U.S. State Department officials and state officials in Florida. Neither effort was successful, but he heard about Project Dynamo through a friend and they helped him get on the flight to Tampa.
“It was a miracle from God because we had no way to get out," Neumann said.
Stern didn't know the exact cost of the most recent flight from Israel to Florida, but said the average cost to charter a plane from Tampa to Israel right now is around $2 million. The governor's office and the Florida Division of Emergency Management provided no answers to questions from the USA TODAY Network - Florida on costs of the trips.
The first Florida arrival of what supporters are calling "DeSantis Airlines" come at the same time the Biden administration is chartering flights from Israel to European destinations so passengers could book connecting flights home. DeSantis has slammed the White House for "dragging its feet" on the charters and said its flights "dump people in Europe."
“But people don't need to be dumped in Europe," DeSantis said in a video posted on the social media website X by his campaign. "They want to get home.”
The flights from Israel occurred the same weekend CBS News' 60 Minutes aired a segment Sunday critical of DeSantis' actions in September 2022, when his administration lured about 50 mostly Venezuelan asylum-seekers from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, off the Massachusetts' coast, with the false promise of jobs and housing.
Money for that trip came from a $12 million fund established within the state's Division of Emergency Management for relocating undocumented migrants from within Florida to other locations. The program has since been expanded and rewritten by the Florida Legislature to authorize DeSantis' action, after its legality was challenged in a handful of lawsuits.
DeSantis while campaigning in Iowa, home of the first Republican presidential nomination contest, has cited the Martha's Vineyard trip as proof of his commitment to combating illegal immigration and to underscore the failures of the Biden administration. DeSantis' White House bid probably lives or dies based on how he performs in Iowa.
Those evacuated from Israel by the state-financed effort focused their praise on Project Dynamo, touting the team's skills and efficiency.
"I'm humbled," said Linda Neumann. "To think that people risked their lives to come get us and our fellow Jews out of a war zone. I thank God for getting us out."

NFL power rankings entering Week 7 of the 2023 season (previous rank in parentheses):
1. 49ers (1): Way too premature to suggest they got exposed against the league's No. 1 defense – especially amid circumstances when you'd expect QB Brock Purdy to have his worst professional game given the staggered absences Sunday of injured Pro Bowlers Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel and Trent Williams around him. Depending on the injuries, there could be an extended setback here, but almost certainly not one that signals the Niners are in major jeopardy.
2. Lions (3): They're indeed in rare air – one more win would make them 6-1 for the first time in the Super Bowl era (since 1966). And while it can be dangerous to look too far ahead, even for a team on a four-game heater, there don't appear to be many losses on the other side of Detroit's Week 9 bye. And if their RB room gets healthy, and WR Jameson Williams continues morphing into the weapon he was intended to be? Roar.
3. Chiefs (4): Including postseason, QB Patrick Mahomes has now started 100 NFL games … and won 80 of them. Crazy. Fifteen percent of his career victories, or 12, have come against Denver – a team that will be back in Kansas City's crosshairs in Week 8.
4. Eagles (2): Time to find something out about a team that largely tightroped its way to 5-0. But Philly couldn't hang in the Jets' mosh pit, and next must try and keep pace with Miami's track team. Maybe breaking out the Kelly Green for "Sunday Night Football" will have the desired effect, though.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
5. Bills (5): Trust issues are becoming evident for a team that's won three laughers, including the Week 4 runaway from the Fins, but had trouble waking up in its other three contests. New England should pose little problem in Week 7, but then Buffalo will be under the prime-time microscope for three in a row.
6. Dolphins (6): How good – really – is this offense? The numbers, individually and collectively, have it tracking to be among the best in league history. In fact, Miami's O is averaging better than 100 yards more than the second-ranked Eagles. But dates with the Philly and K.C. defenses in two of the next three weeks should provide litmus tests … like the one Miami failed at Buffalo in Week 4.
7. Jaguars (7): A club that just spent two weeks in London now hits the road for two more games outside Duval County. RB Travis Etienne has 339 yards and four TDs from scrimmage during Jacksonville's three-game winning streak.
8. Cowboys (8): Scratching out a win in LA against the Chargers – in front of legions of Dallas fans – salvaged a bye week that was on the verge of ruination, especially pitted against former OC Kellen Moore and coming on the heels of the blowout in San Francisco. WR Brandin Cooks' TD catch Monday means he's reached the end zone with five NFL teams.
9. Steelers (9): A team that's won three of four coming out of its bye week is also about to get WR Diontae Johnson back on an offense that needs a spark.
10. Ravens (10): A team that's only had two home games will play four of its next five in Baltimore. Fun fact: Lamar Jackson has joined Michael Vick as the only quarterbacks to rush for at least 50 yards in a game 50 times.
11. Browns (13): Cleveland's stingy D has ceded 1,002 yards, fewest through five games in 52 years. On average, the Browns are surrendering 200.4 yards a week, more than 60 fewer than Baltimore's second-ranked defense.
12. Bengals (22): They leveled back to .500 entering a much-needed bye week. QB Joe Burrow, WR Tee Higgins and Co. better rest up, though, because they're not scheduled to face a team currently below .500 until Week 15, a stretch that starts with the Niners and Bills.
13. Rams (11): WR Puka Nacua's production has unsurprisingly downshifted with the return of Cooper Kupp, but he's still carved out a nice piece of historical real estate. The rookie's 50 catches for 598 yards are both records in the Super Bowl era for a player through six career games.
14. Seahawks (12): Despite Sunday's pair of unfortunate INTs, QB Geno Smith's mistakes are essentially on par with 2022's level. It's his touchdown production that's down by nearly half.
15. Jets (21): Per HC Robert Saleh, "(W)e’ve played a gauntlet of quarterbacks. I know we haven’t gotten all wins, but we’ve embarrassed all of them." Whether or not that's legitimately true, it's a fact this defense hasn't allowed as many as 300 net passing yards since the end of the 2021 season. (And, yes, it was to Tom Brady, who was rarely embarrassed by the Jets.)
16. Texans (18): They have two players with at least three TD catches … same as the entirety of Houston's 2022 season. No team has fewer giveaways than their three.
17. Buccaneers (14): If you don't want QB Baker Mayfield to shoulder an inordinate amount of the offensive load, you can't wallow at the bottom of the league with 3.0 yards per carry.
18. Saints (15): Here's a crazy factoid: Since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, Walter Payton is the only player to have more games (25) with a pass attempt, carry and catch than New Orleans' Taysom Hill (20).
19. Chargers (20): You can argue they stole defeat from the jaws of victory yet again. Now? Better regroup quickly for a short week that will end in Kansas City against the rested Chiefs … in a game the Bolts really need.
20. Raiders (23): A win at Chicago on Sunday puts Las Vegas above .500 … which wouldn’t be bad at all for a team tied for the AFC lead with 12 turnovers.
21. Packers (24): Assuming they're revitalized coming out of their bye, could be time to go on a run given they're not scheduled to see an opponent currently sporting a winning record until Week 10.
22. Vikings (25): Another week and another key injury (LB Marcus Davenport, ankle) for a struggling team apparently determined not to have a fire sale.
23. Commanders (27): With four of their next six against NFC East opponents, including both games against the Giants, Washington could well be entering a stretch that determines its season … and quite possibly HC Ron Rivera's viability beyond 2023.
24. Falcons (16): Is there any head coach more fun to watch – meaning, literally taking in his facial expressions – than Arthur Smith? If he wants the focus back on his brilliance as a play caller and not his sideline grimaces, Smith might need to pivot to QB Taylor Heinicke.
25. Titans (19): QB Ryan Tannehill's ankle injury effectively sunk Tennessee in 2022. It's come earlier this year.
26. Colts (17): QB Anthony Richardson's shoulder injury will likely scuttle his rookie season, per owner Jim Irsay. Probably an unsurvivable setback … unless RB Jonathan Taylor displays his 2021 form soon.
27. Giants (29): ESPN Stats & Info sums up their start pretty well, noting the G-Men are the fourth team since 1950 which failed to score an offensive touchdown before halftime in each of their first six games. In fact, New York's offense hasn't scored a TD since Week 3.
28. Broncos (28): They'll only leave Denver one time from now until December. That may not necessarily be a plus given how this 1-5 outfit is trending … though if Sean Payton continues offloading players, at least the home fans will have some new guys to boo.
29. Bears (26): Two steps forward, one step back for QB Justin Fields, whose dislocated thumb threatens to send this squad back into hibernation.
30. Cardinals (30): That's three straight losses by an average of 16.7 points per. It took a month, but it appears the Cards are who we thought they were.
31. Patriots (31): Among their many, many failings? No team has fewer takeaways (3). And no team has a higher percentage of drives (81.7%) that end without points.
32. Panthers (32): Little has gone right for Carolina, but at least WR Adam Thielen continues to shine. Only two undrafted players have more 100-yard receiving games than his 24, and only one (Wes Welker) has more with double-digit catches than Thielen's eight.

LAS VEGAS – Raiders coach Josh McDaniels expressed relief that the back injury that knocked quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo out of Sunday’s game against the New England Patriots wasn’t much worse. But Garoppolo’s availability for next weekend is still uncertain.
McDaniels, speaking to media on Monday morning, said the major concern was that Garoppolo suffered internal injuries as he was taken by ambulance from Allegiant Stadium to a local hospital. Tests apparently ruled out internal injuries.
“Seems like we’ve dodged a big bullet in that regard,” McDaniels said. “So that’s good news.”
Further tests are pending, McDaniels said, leaving Garoppolo’s status a question mark for Sunday’s game at Chicago.
“There’s still a lot to uncover,” McDaniels said. “We’ll make sure we’re doing all the right things moving forward. But the prognosis is a lot better than it might have otherwise been.”
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
McDaniels did not indicate whether Brian Hoyer or rookie Aidan O’Connell would start on Sunday for the Raiders (3-3) if Garoppolo is sidelined again. Hoyer played the entire second half in relieving Garoppolo during the 21-17 victory against the Patriots. O’Connell started in place of an injured Garoppolo in Week 4 against the Los Angeles Chargers.
“The fact that we’ve played three guys already certainly doesn’t hurt,” McDaniels said. “It’s not ideal in terms of what you want to do, but they’ve both got some experience and they’ve both had to operate our offense in critical situations and close games. That’s helpful for them, too.”
LAS VEGAS – Well, at least one thing hasn’t changed when it comes to the Patriot Way.
When he loses, nobody does grumpy quite like Bill Belichick.
And there’s been so much of that lately.
"One of a number of things could have made a difference," Belichick said after the 21-17 setback against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday marked a third consecutive loss. "We just need to coach it better, play it better, execute it better. That’s really the story again."
If only it were that simple.

This time, the Patriots – blown out by an aggregate score of 72-3 the previous two games – actually had a chance to pull out a win at the end at Allegiant Stadium. They didn’t quit, cave or fold up the tent. But they wound up with the same lousy result.
And the story again is that New England just isn’t good enough anymore.
The Patriots are 1-5. That’s another first under Belichick, another in a series of firsts for futility.
Here’s another one: The Patriots had a grand total of -2 net yards in the first quarter. Until Sunday, they had never had a first quarter with zero yards or less. Ouch.
The last time they were 1-5? Go back to 1995 – the year after Robert Kraft bought the franchise.
If you’re into train wrecks or just down for seeing a Belichick team suffer, the pristine palace that will host Super Bowl 58 in February was the place. Funny, the team wore the New England uniforms. But somewhere along the way – or sometime after Tom Brady departed – they changed the definition of the Patriot Way.
Remember how it used to be? Belichick’s team, resourceful and on-point when it came to situational football, used to be the ones to capitalize on the mistakes of others. During those glory years spanning two decades, they often came back because they could count on the other guys screwing up in crunch time.
Now, with Sunday providing another example, the shoe is other the other foot.
Start with this: The Patriots committed 10 penalties for 79 yards. This is the undisciplined stuff that facilitates losing football games. The flags came early, as in two penalties on two linemen on the first two offensive snaps. And they came late, as in three penalties in the final three minutes. A defensive pass interference call on third down extended a Raiders drive, then after New England forced a punt, holding and delay-of-game penalties backed up the offense and set up the disaster of a game-clinching safety with 1:47 remaining as Mac Jones was sacked in the end zone.
There was also a sweet catch-and-run by Ezekiel Elliott in the second quarter that went for a 74-yard touchdown…until it was called back by a holding penalty.
Yeah, there’s another type of Patriot Way showing up these days.
Jones, the third-year quarterback, led a promising drive into Raiders territory late in the second quarter that might have tied the game. Then as he rolled away from pursuit on a second down, he threw across his body and way the head of tight end Hunter Henry. Tre’von Moehrig intercepted the gift to snuff out that threat.
"Just trying to do too much," said Jones, who passed for 200 yards but didn’t throw for a TD.
Late in the game, two snaps before the safety, Jones threw a deep dime to DeVante Parker, who ran a go route along the left sideline. The football glanced off Parker’s hands, the receiver blowing an opportunity to at least position for a possible go-ahead field goal.
The collection of gaffes is more stunning when considering the man in charge. For a coach who has preached details while enjoying so much success – including six Super Bowl championships with the Patriots – this has to turn his stomach to watch. What a way to achieve a milestone, as Belichick coached in his 500th NFL game, including playoffs, on Sunday.
Asked afterward whether he is taking this Patriots slide personally, Belichick grumbled.
"Right now, it’s just about this game," he said.
Belichick pushed back on the notion that the same types of miscues have been repeated rather than corrected.
"This game was a lot different than the last two games," he maintained. "So, you can’t compare those."
No, the Patriots weren’t blown out against a team coached by a protégé, Josh McDaniels, who previously served as Belichick’s offensive coordinator, and quarterbacked by two other ex-Patriots – Jimmy Garoppolo and Brian Hoyer (Garoppolo didn’t play after halftime due to a back injury, for which he was taken to a hospital for tests).
There was a measure of progress. Yet just like last week and the week before, the Patriots are left to process their reality.
As Jones put it, “You’ve got to watch the film with truthful eyes.”
There’s a lot of football left. That can be interpreted as half-full or half-empty. If the losing continues, the questions about the team’s focus and intensity will escalate.
"It’s up to us to look ourselves in the mirror and see who we are individually and what are we going to bring every day," said receiver Kendrick Bourne, who caught 10 passes for 89 yards on Sunday. "Are we going to quit, come to work just to work? Or are we going to come to work to really work with good effort so we can change things around?"
The morale is certainly being tested, if it isn’t shaken. David Andrews, the ninth-year veteran center, is the only starter on offense or defense who remains from the last Super Bowl title team. He doesn’t see much choice when it comes to the approach to this crisis.
"Football is like life," Andrews said. "There’s highs, there’s lows, there’s in-between. When there’s lows, the only thing you do is fight your way out of it. You can’t lay down. You can’t quit. I don’t believe in that. Never believed in that. So, the only thing you can do is keep fighting, keep throwing punches, keep swinging."
And lately, keep getting off the mat as another version of the Patriot Way.
Week 6 in the NFL brought some stunning upsets, including a pair that unseated the last remaining undefeated teams.
The San Francisco 49ers were facing a Cleveland Browns team that was missing Deshaun Watson and Nick Chubb, but rainy conditions, a poor game from Brock Purdy and missed field goals sunk the Niners.
In New Jersey, the Jets rode their defense to four turnovers, including uncharacteristic interceptions from Jalen Hurts, to take down the Philadelphia Eagles.
Elsewhere in the NFC, a team that had been waiting a long time to contend, the Detroit Lions, are balanced, versatile and looking poised to make a run.
Here are the winners and losers from Sunday of Week 6.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
On the back of an aggressive defense, the Jacksonville Jaguars (4-2) took down the Indianapolis Colts 37-20 for a season sweep against their AFC South rivals. That gives Jacksonville a nice bump in the race for the division title, but if there’s any indication that that Jaguars may stick around, it’s the team’s turnover differential of +7, which ranks second in the NFL. Jacksonville leads the NFL in takeaways with 15. By comparison, the Jaguars had 27 last season, tied for fourth-best.
Their four takeaways against the Colts helped them build an early lead. Jacksonville still allows far too many explosive passing plays (it allowed three completions of 40 or more yards Sunday) and will need to limit those moving forward. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence has been solid and running back Travis Etienne ranks sixth in the league in rushing yards (451), but it’s Jacksonville’s propensity to create turnovers that gives it the ability to win any given week.
The Lions (5-1), as the only team in the NFC North with a winning record, are running away with the division. They have a two-and-a-half game lead on the next closest team. They are balanced, with an offense capable of explosive fits and a defense that limits big plays. What makes Detroit so fun to watch is that it is versatile enough to win in different ways. And its players are maximizing effort, too.
In a 20-6 road win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, quarterback Jared Goff lit up the box score to the tune of 353 yards and a pair of touchdowns. In previous weeks, it had been David Montgomery and the rushing game posting big numbers. The defense has been steadily productive and limited Tampa Bay to two third-down conversions and no red=zone touchdowns on two tries. For the first time since 1969, the Lions have won four straight games by 14 points or more. More may be coming.
New York was without its two starting cornerbacks, Sauce Garnder — one of the finest in the NFL — and D.J. Reed. It was still missing Aaron Rodgers, yet the Jets defeated the Eagles 20-14 for the first time in franchise history. Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts has been in the MVP conversation. New York, however, intercepted Hurts three times and pressured him on 21 of 50 dropbacks (42%).
The Jets (3-3) are hanging around in the AFC East, though the offense with Zach Wilson (19-of-33 for 186 yards) under center remains anemic. The Jets converted just two-of-11 third-down attempts (18.2%). They went just one-of-four in the red zone. Those numbers alone make it remarkable that New York upset the Eagles, but it also shows the proficiency of the defense. This was a statement victory. But unless the offense eventually shows it can bear some weight, this style will prove unsustainable.
By no means is he a finished product, and he still needs to sustain this production over a longer sample size, but second-year Washington Commanders quarterback Sam Howell is taking steps toward becoming a reliable option. Howell, 23, ranks ninth in the NFL in passing (1,500 yards) and is posting an above-average completion rate (67.8%).
In a 24-16 win against the Atlanta Falcons, Howell recorded his first three-touchdown game. He also did it against a team that came into Sunday with the eighth-ranked passing defense (190.8 yards per game allowed). Yet, what has made Howell’s performance this year so impressive is that he’s doing it behind a tattered Washington (3-3) offensive line that has yielded more sacks (34) than any other in the NFL. Some of those sacks, of course, are on Howell, but his ability to evade pressure and release the ball quickly should give him some staying power in the league.
San Francisco, the most consistent team in the league thus far, failed to seize opportunities against the Browns in a 19-17 defeat. And while a pair of missed field goals loom large, second-year quarterback Brock Purdy played the worst game of his career. Rookie third-round place kicker Jake Moody pushed a 41-yard field goal that would have won the game, and he also hooked a 54-yarder in the first quarter. The one in the opening frame came after linebacker Fred Warner returned an interception to the Cleveland 26-yard line; with that short of a field, the Niners (5-1) should’ve done far more with that drive, anyway.
This was a game in which P.J. Walker started at quarterback for the Browns, who were also Chubb, their longtime offensive engine. The only score for San Francisco after the second quarter was after Walker’s second interception gifted the Niners the ball on the 8-yard line. Purdy (12-of-27 for 125 yards and one touchdown with one interception) struggled, and now offensive stars Christian McCaffrey and Deebo Samuel are banged up.
This was always going to be a tough ask, upsetting the Buffalo Bills on the road with backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor starting. But New York (1-5) settled for a pair of field goals Sunday night after it had marched the ball down to Buffalo’s 11-yard line and failed miserably in the red zone.
There was the end of the first half, when New York got it down to the Bills’ 1-yard line. But with no timeouts and with the clock at 14 seconds, Taylor appeared to audible into a run play for Saquon Barkley. It was stopped short, the clock bled and the Giants couldn’t come away with any points. Then there was the final play of the game, an untimed down with the Giants again at the Buffalo 1-yard line. This time New York did opt to pass, but the attempt fell incomplete, cementing a 14-9 loss. New York ended the game 0-for-5 in red zone tries and 0-for-3 in goal-to-go spots. Against weaker teams, maybe those missteps aren't fatal. Against the Bills, you’re asking to lose.
The Seattle Seahawks outgained the Cincinnati Bengals by a margin of 381-214. They recorded 24 first downs to Cincinnati’s 15. They held the ball for eight more minutes. Yet in a 17-13 loss, Seattle (3-2) was done by quarterback Geno Smith's interceptions and the offense's inability to punch the ball in the end zone.
Smith did throw for 323 yards, but he also tossed a red zone interception at the start of the second half and another at the start of the fourth, after the Seahawks had whittled the Cincy lead down. But Seattle was just 1-of-5 in red-zone situations, including 1-of-4 in goal-to-go scenarios. The Seahawks had a couple of shots at the end zone inside the four-minute mark in the fourth quarter. The first time, Smith was sacked twice in four plays. The second, he couldn’t connect with receiver DK Metcalf twice for the game-winning touchdown. All in all, it wasted a solid defensive performance.
With Mike Vrabel as their head coach, the Tennessee Titans have been — for the most part — consistent. They’ve had a winning record in four of the last five years. Tennessee has claimed the division twice and has made three trips to the postseason.
Now, as it heads home from London after a 24-16 setback against the Baltimore Ravens and goes into the bye week with a 2-4 record and sitting in last place, Tennessee faces a crossroads. That’s primarily because quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who has been the starter since 2019, is no longer suitable to direct this offense. Tannehill, 35, was carted off with an ankle injury against the Ravens, but he has been ineffective even when healthy. He was never a star in Tennessee, but the offense was at its best when he could play turnover-free, clean football. He has a 2:6 touchdown-to-interception ratio this year and is on pace for a career-low 71.9 QB rating. It might be time to look to the future.
WASHINGTON - Hunter Biden's lawyers are carrying out an aggressive counterattack as Republicans make the president's son the focus of an impeachment inquiry and a special counsel investigation threatens to hang over the 2024 election.
In a two-week span in September, President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden sued Rudy Giuliani over the release of personal material on Biden's laptop, the Internal Revenue Service for allegedly revealing confidential information about his taxes and former Trump White House aide Garrett Ziegler for allegedly accessing and tampering with computer data that he does not own.
Hunter Biden's legal team also issued third-party subpoenas to Trump allies Roger Stone, Steve Bannon and Giuliani, along with six others, in recent weeks seeking information and documents related to Hunter Biden's external hard drive and laptop - contents of which each have boasted about possessing.
The moves taking aim at Hunter Biden's accusers reflect a more aggressive legal strategy adopted by his attorney, Abbe Lowell, who was hired last December, and long pushed by Kevin Morris, a Hollywood attorney, novelist and close friend of Hunter Biden. Morris advised going on offense after Republicans gained control of the House in the 2022 midterm elections.
"The Republicans have had the microphone to themselves for many, many months," said David Brock, a Democratic operative and president of Facts First USA, which he launched to counter Republicans' claims about the president's son.
"The thinking is to put some facts out there in the public domain so that the public can have a more accurate picture of Hunter and what went on here rather than the distorted Republican lens that is refracted through most of the media coverage," Brock said.
More:Hunter Biden as a 'foreign agent'? Inquiry comes as DOJ ramps up previously 'rare' enforcement
A counterpunch was also delivered as Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty this month to three gun-related charges in a Delaware federal court after a previous deal with prosecutors to plead guilty collapsed.
Lowell, in a statement, slammed the charges as "the result of political pressure from President Trump and his MAGA allies to force the Justice Department to ignore the law and deviate from its policies in cases like this one."
Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to three gun-related charges for his purchase of a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver on Oct. 12, 2018 when he has said he was on drugs.
Hunter Biden's lawyers have argued the charges are unconstitutional under the Second Amendment and barred under the prior plea agreement that fell apart. Lowell has said there’s evidence that will exonerate Hunter Biden “when and if there is a trial."
Hunter Biden could also face tax-evasion charges under an ongoing investigation by U.S. Attorney David Weiss, a Trump-appointed prosecutor who was given special counsel status in August. Like the gun charges, Biden had previously reached a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for not paying taxes in 2017 and 2018 before the agreement collapsed.
In addition, the Justice Department is considering a possible third set of charges over Hunter Biden's decision not to register as a "foreign agent" while working with companies in Ukraine and China.
The recent subpoena letters are part of counter lawsuit Hunter Biden filed in March against John Paul Mac Isaac - the owner of a Delaware computer shop - that fights the dissemination of material from an external hard drive and personal laptop that's long been at the heart of the Hunter Biden controversy.
For years, Republicans have exploited material found on a hard drive on Hunter Biden's personal laptop that he left at Mac Isaac's Delaware store in 2019 but never returned to pick back up. Mac Isaac, an outspoken supporter of former President Donald Trump, claimed ownership of the equipment and passed it along to the FBI and to Giuliani ahead of the 2020 election.
Hunter Biden's lawyers accuse Mac Isaac of invasion of privacy, arguing that Hunter Biden never gave him permission to access, copy and share electronically stored data on the computer. The subpoena letters to others like Stone and Bannon could preview future litigation against others who disseminated the material.
“What you will see as this progresses is simply a vise closing on a group of conspirators set on destroying the first family,” said a source close to Hunter Biden.
The lawsuit filed last month against Giuliani, which includes Castello as a co-defendant, says both men engaged in a "total annihilation" Hunter's "digital privacy." Garrett Ziegler, who has also claimed to possess a copy of Hunter Biden's hard drive, is accused of similar violations in a separate lawsuit for his role in publishing a trove of emails and images of Hunter Biden on the Internet.
Emails and other material discovered on the laptop provide a bulk of the evidence that House Republicans cite to allege "influence-peddling" by Hunter Biden in his foreign business deals as a board member of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. House Republicans have been unable to prove their most serious claim: that Joe Biden, as vice president, received bribe payments through his son to steer U.S. policy.
At a initial impeachment inquiry House hearing last month, Republicans' own witnesses said their lacked evidence of bribery or other impeachable offenses by Joe Bide.
The laptop also contained nude photos of Hunter Biden that Republicans have seized on to embarrass the president and his son.
Ankush Khardori, a former federal prosecutor, said Hunter Biden's legal team is trying to "humanize" and show more complexities of a client who has been effectively "disembodied" through relentless attacks by Republicans. But he is skeptical the argument will prove effective with a privileged son of a president.
"This isn't someone I think most people are predisposed to feel any real pity for," he said. "I'm pretty dubious it will work."
Khardori also questioned the soundness of Hunter Biden's legal argument that Mac Isaac took unlawful possession of the laptop. Mac Isaac claims Hunter Biden signed a form stating that any equipment left at the repair shop for more than 90 days would be considered abandoned.
The lawsuit against Giuliani alleges he and Costello spent months reviewing and manipulating the data before releasing it - accusing them of violating the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, California’s Computer Data Access and Fraud Act and California’s Unfair Competition Law. Hunter Biden currently resides in California.
Hunter Biden's attorneys also pointed to comments Giuliani made this year on his podcasts bragging about loading data from Hunter Biden's equipment onto his own computer and accessing it during the program.
Meanwhile, Costello stated publicly he “scrolled through” thousands of emails, bank statements and pictures, which made him “feel like a voyeur,” according to the lawsuit. Costello said publicly he manipulated the data to be “cleaned up," the lawsuit argues, and created new digital folders with titles such as “Salacious Pics” and “The Big Guy."
The lawsuit against the IRS targets two IRS agents, Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, who testified before Congress as federal whistleblowers and claimed they were hindered by the Justice Department during a five year investigation of Hunter Biden's business dealings.
Lowell, in the lawsuit, argues Shapley and Joseph Ziegler revealed confidential information about Hunter Biden's taxes - including during more than 20 nationally televised interview - in an “assault” on his client's privacy that sought to embarrass him.
"Mr. Biden has no fewer or lesser rights than any other American citizen, and no government agency or government agent has free reign to violate his rights simply because of who he is," Lowell wrote. "Yet the IRS and its agents have conducted themselves under a presumption that the rights that apply to every other American citizen do not apply to Mr. Biden."
The lawsuit contends Biden is eligible for $1,000 in statutory damages for each unauthorized disclosure and also unspecified punitive damages.
"Whenever someone is attacked publicly and they feel like they've been treated unfairly, they're going to want to fight back. And so I do think part of what happened here," Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor now practicing at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP, said of Hunter Biden's aggressive legal strategy.
But he said the goal is more than just changing the public narrative about Hunter Biden.
"I don't think that a strategy like this is meant primarily for PR purposes," he said, arguing the larger purpose is to gather additional evidence and "put adversaries on the defensive."
That strategy, of course, could have major political ramifications for President Joe Biden.
Rather than dealing with his legal troubles quietly, Hunter Biden's lawsuits and his legal team's public jabs against his Republican foes and the IRS could ensure the controversy remains in the spotlight during Joe Biden's 2024 reelection bid.
"I think it's apparent that Hunter Biden is focused on his own rights and his own interests, and not on his father's political career," Mariotti said, "given that he's now engaging in a very aggressive attack on the prosecution and its witnesses."

GOP presidential hopeful Asa Hutchinson might be trailing in 2024 polls, but that hasn’t stopped the former Arkansas governor from making his case on the campaign trail.  
At a Republican presidential town hall in Exeter, New Hampshire, hosted by Seacoastonline and the USA TODAY Network last week, Hutchinson outlined his platform focused on sending additional resources to the U.S. southern border, addressing school shootings and quelling the opioid crisis that has ravaged communities across the country.
“We have a nation that has its challenges. I’m running for president because I believe that we need new leadership,” Hutchinson told the small crowd of New Hampshire voters who gathered last Tuesday at the historic Exeter Town Hall, where party-founder President Abraham Lincoln spoke months before he was elected in 1860. 
“We need a course correction in the Republican Party,” Hutchinson said, arguing that the current frontrunner, former President Donald Trump, “is not the right leader” for the party or country.   
While Hutchinson is currently hovering around 1% in polls of Republican voters, he said he hopes to reach 4% by Thanksgiving and doesn’t plan on dropping out of the race before New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary.  
"It's up to the voters of this state to determine what kind of leadership we want," the former congressman and head of the Drug Enforcement Administration said. 
The New England state has a comparatively small number of delegates in the Republican presidential nomination process. But its historic status as the first primary state on the party’s calendar, has made it a testing ground for White House hopefuls. Results of the state's primary can make or break campaigns.
As Hutchinson jockeys for more space in the Republican presidential contest, here’s a look at the issues he talked about in New Hampshire that would impact voters from coast to coast.  
Hutchinson described securing the U.S. southern border as “the most fundamental question and responsibility the next president will have.” 
Among his first acts as president would be providing additional resources for the U.S. Border Patrol. Hutchinson also vowed to continue construction of the border wall that became a signature conservative policy during the Trump administration.
The former Arkansas governor called on leaders to streamline the processing of asylum seekers, “so we’re not catching and then releasing them and expecting them to show up four years later,” referring to the practice of releasing, rather than detaining, migrants while they await hearings.
Hutchinson suggested he would forge partnerships with southern allies, particularly Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, along with governors across the country to design solutions at the border. In particular, he expressed support for the 1,000-foot water barrier Texas Gov. Greg Abbott constructed in the Rio Grande earlier this year to prevent border crossings. 
Nearly 110,000 people died of an opioid overdose in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tackling the issue is top of mind for millions of Americans, especially voters in New Hampshire, which is among the states with the highest rates of opioid-related deaths.  
Addressing voters in the Granite State, Hutchinson said he’d take a three-pronged approach to thwart the epidemic by providing improving education about addiction, boosting treatment options and cracking down on drug trafficking from other countries.  
“You’ve got to have treatment facilities that are expanded and available in our communities. That’s a joint federal and state responsibility,” he said.  
Once head of the DEA during former President George W. Bush's administration, Hutchinson criticized candidates in the 2024 race who have called for using force against Mexico in an effort to stop the importation of fentanyl.
“We don’t invade Canada because we got marijuana coming in, and so we don’t invade Mexico” he asserted at the Exeter town hall. “We work with them in partnership, but we have to make sure that they support the rule of law.” 
Fielding a question about how he would protect children from school shootings and during active shooter drills, Hutchinson pushed for investing in security measures in schools and increased mental health resources for kids from coast to coast.
“Today, to have active shooter drills is not what we want our children to experience in life, but they are adaptable,” he said, noting that his generation experienced nuclear attack duck and cover drills. “The most important thing is parents need to know their children are safe when they drop them off for school, so we need to invest in our school security.” 
However, Hutchinson's comments weren't an endorsement of gun control measures, and the Arkansas governor vowed that he would not take firearms away from Americans.
Hutchinson also spoke more broadly about the state of schools in the U.S. Responding to a voter's question about how he would slim down the federal bureaucracy, the former Arkansas governor said that, if Congress passed a bill abolishing the Department of Education, he would sign it to give states more authority over their school systems. 
He said he also believes school choice is a “matter that should be left up to the states." School choice refers to the process of using taxpayer funds to potentially send a child to a school other than their local public school.
A report published earlier this year by the Social Security Administration found that the estimated 67 million Americans who collect Social Security funds each month could see their benefits cut short by up to 25% by 2034, as the ratio of retirees to workers in the U.S. increases. 
When asked about his plans to tackle the problem and keep social security solvent, Hutchinson said he’d employ a strategy used by former President Ronald Reagan, relying on a commission to investigate and make recommendations to Congress on how to finance Medicare and Social Security for the future. 
“There are a lot of ideas out there, all of those ideas will be on the table,” he said.  
But Hutchinson didn't suggest shrinking the program. For example, he said, if elected president, he would remove penalties for people ages 62 to 66 who are in the workforce and earn more than $21,240, but want to take Social Security benefits.  
Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy emphasized his status as a political outsider in the 2024 race for the White House during a New Hampshire town hall sponsored by the USA TODAY Network and Seacoastonline last week.
“I think we live in a moment where it will take an outsider, someone who comes from the outside, really someone who comes from the next generation to reach the next generation,” Ramaswamy, 38, said Saturday at the historic Exeter Town Hall in Exeter, New Hampshire.
But the youngest presidential candidate also took the USA TODAY Network behind the scenes, sharing his day-to-day habits on the campaign trail. Here's a closer look at Ramaswamy's favorite books, soundtracks and other picks.
These days, Ramaswamy said he’s mostly reading policy papers and making sure he's caught up on the day's news. But he and his wife, Dr. Apoorva Ramaswamy, have been reading “G-Man: J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the American Century,” a book about former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover.
“Very fascinating read,” Ramaswamy said. “It gives me a perspective on some of the issues we're talking about in the present, but how they date back decades into our country's history. So that's a half decent book that I'd recommend.”
Ramaswamy noted he's traveling with his two kids, a three and a half year old and a one year old, on the campaign trail.
“A lot of the soundtrack from 'Cars 2' and 'Monsters Inc.' Those have been, I would say, all the rage in the family recently,” Ramaswamy said. 
Ramaswamy said watching football on Sundays is the closest he gets to watching a guilty pleasure TV show.
“Late night, if I'm getting home and it's like 9:30 p.m. on a rarity, I'll go to sleep, catch up on some sleep, get up early the next morning, get a workout in,” Ramaswamy said. 
“That's where my focus has been. But a little bit of football season after the end of tennis season has been good for me in decompressing.”
When asked how he would help young Americans across the country, Ramaswamy told USA TODAY that one of the things a president has to do is grow the economy for all.
“Young Americans have not enjoyed economic mobility for a long time, and that's why many young people are disaffected from politics and from the government,” Ramaswamy said. “I get that.”
Part of addressing these frustrations is to lower inflation and bring down other costs, he said.
“What do we do to accomplish that? Unlock American energy,” Ramaswamy said. “That's the number one driver of inflation as high energy costs. That's also how we grow our economy. Reforming the Federal Reserve is also key.”
He also said he wants to help provide multiple paths to success for young people.
“The only path to the American Dream can't just be four year college degrees and standard expensive college debt laden paths to get ahead in this country,” Ramaswamy said. “There have to be multiple paths to success, including even one or two year vocational education, building skills in the trades.”
WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump continued to walk back his previous criticism of Israel, telling Iowa voters on Monday that he has always supported the longtime ally now engaged in a war with Hamas.
"We stand with Israel," Trump said during a rally encouraging supporters to attend the Jan. 15 Iowa caucuses that kick off the Republican presidential nomination.
Trump was also more a little more reticent about the indictments and four criminal cases against him, hours after a federal judge issued a limited gag order on the former president and 2024 Republican presidential candidate.
Claiming the gag order, which only applies to the federal charges alleging he tried to steal the 2020 election, is unconstitutional, Trump said: "we'll appeal it and we'll see."
In a second speech, ostensibly devoted to national security, Trump vowed to press on with his presidential campaign and added: "I am willing to go to jail if that's what it takes for our country to win and become a democracy again.”
Trump's two appearances in Iowa on Monday were his first speeches since his criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - and compliments of Hezbollah - drew counterattacks from his Republican primary opponents.
Speaking before supporters last week in West Palm Beach, Fla., Trump attacked Netanyahu for refusing to participate in the 2020 targeted killing of an Iranian general.
Trump also criticized unnamed Israeli officials for discussing the possibility of attacks from Hezbollah, saying those comments might tip off the militant group to the county's vulnerabilities. He added: "You know, Hezbollah is very smart ... They’re all very smart.”
Trump additionally criticized Netanyahu in an interview with Fox News Radio over the Hamas attack. "He was not prepared," Trump said. "He was not prepared and Israel was not prepared."
During his Iowa appearances, Trump did not mention Netanyahu and Hezbollah. He focused instead on Iran and President Joe Biden, blaming both for the outbreak of more violence in the region earlier this month.
Trump first sought to clean up the damage with social media posts and written statements over the weekend. In a Truth Social post, Trump included the hashtags #IStandWithIsrael” and “#IStandWithBibi."
Trump's opponents for the Republican presidential nomination have spent days denouncing his comments on Israel, saying they undermined an ally in the midst of a crisis and could embolden Iran.
“He’s a fool," said former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. "Only a fool would make those kinds of comments. Only a fool would give comments that could give aid and comfort to Israel’s adversary.”
Former South Carolina governor - and United Nations ambassador - Nikki Haley said Trump's comments underscore that he is out of touch. "It's why I continue to say it is time for a new, generational leader," Haley said on CNN's "State of the Union."
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, speaking on Fox News, said Trump seems to have a personal beef with Netanyahu because the Israeli prime minister called Biden to congratulate him on winning the 2020 election, despite Trump's protests about the race.
Saying that "attacking Bibi was a huge mistake" from Trump, DeSantis argued that it was "personal for him to come out and take shots at Bibi just days after Israel had suffered the worst terrorist attack in its history."
Trump enjoys big leads in state and national polls, including ones conducted in Iowa and New Hampshire.
In both speeches on Monday, Trump again criticized his criminal prosecutions and civil trials, though he held off on specifying Justice Department prosecutor Jack Smith and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan.
Hours earlier, Chutkan issued a gag order that puts limits on what Trump can say about prosecutors, witnesses, and court personnel. The judge said Trump did not have the right to use his campaign to mount a "smear campaign" against legal officials.
While Trump did not single out individuals, he did claim that "they've weaponized the Justice Department and the FBI," and he protested the new order. This order does not apply to the charges he faces in Georgia over allegations he tried to steal the election in the Peach State.
"I'll be the only politician in history that runs with a gag order where I'm not allowed to criticize people," Trump said during his first speech in Adel, Iowa.
In his second set of remarks, in Clive, Trump did not mention Chutkan by name, but said: "The judge doesn't like me too much."
At a moment when banks are slashing overdraft fees and President Biden is vowing a crackdown on hidden “junk” fees, the dreaded ATM surcharge has never been higher.
Americans who use an “out-of-network” ATM pay $4.73 in fees, on average, according to a study by the personal finance site Bankrate.
As other routine banking charges trend downward, ATM fees are creeping up. The average cash-machine customer paid $1.97 for the service in 1998, Bankrate reports. The average rose to $3.74 in 2010 and $4.52 in 2015.
Banks generally allow free use of their own ATMs. They may be leveraging out-of-network fees, banking experts say, to replace lost revenue from other sources.
“I think there’s a kind of Whac-A-Mole nature to bank fees,” said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate. “If one goes down, something else is going to go up. And ATM fees are a lever they are pulling.”

The annual Bankrate survey draws on data from banks and thrifts in 25 large U.S. markets.
Fees for overdrafts and insufficient funds have declined by nearly half since pre-pandemic 2019, according to a report by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB. Banks collected $1.6 billion in overdraft and insufficient-fund fees in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $3.1 billion in the same period of 2019.
Many large banks voluntarily reduced or eliminated overdraft fees in 2021 and 2022, under pressure from lawmakers and regulators.
That is not to say the overdraft fee is extinct.
“Our survey found that 91% of banks still charge overdraft fees in some instances,” Rossman said.
The average overdraft fee peaked at $33.58 in 2021, according to Bankrate data. It declined to $26.61 in 2023.
Those $30 and $35 fees were hard for banks to justify, analysts say, and they unduly burdened those living from paycheck to paycheck. Not surprisingly, the fees proved unpopular with customers.
This month, the Biden administration launched a fresh crackdown on “junk" fees, proposing new rules to bar hidden charges. The Federal Trade Commission would require companies it regulates to be upfront about the full price of concert and sports tickets, hotel rooms and apartment and car rentals.
The Biden administration also warned banks not to charge fees for basic services, such as checking an account balance.
No account holder likes ATM fees. But customers may find it tricky to assign blame.
ATM fees are a one-two punch. One fee comes from whomever owns the ATM: A bank that isn’t yours, or a cash-only restaurant in Detroit, or a bodega in Brooklyn. That fee averages $3.15, Bankrate found.
The ATM surcharge is generally stated upfront. An ATM customer might fume about paying it, but it would be illogical to direct that wrath at their bank.
The second fee comes from your own bank, ostensibly for the service of dispensing cash through someone else’s ATM. Out-of-network fees average $1.58.
Customers might not be aware of the second fee, unless they pay close attention to their transaction records. The out-of-network fee isn’t likely to appear on an ATM screen.
As a consumer watchdog issue, the out-of-network fee “is a tough one,” said Elizabeth Renter, a data journalist at NerdWallet. “At a surface level, I don’t think that they should [charge it], because you’re their customer.”
At nearly $5 a pop, all told, ATM fees can add up.
One 2019 survey by MagnifyMoney, another personal finance site, found that American consumers hated ATM fees more than overdraft fees, credit-card annual fees, airline baggage fees or late-payment fees.
In that poll, a solid majority of respondents said they would drive miles to avoid an ATM fee. The MagnifyMoney survey reached a representative group of 1,028 Americans.
The solution to ATM fees: Find a bank that doesn’t charge them. Unfortunately, it’s hard to shop for a bank by comparing those fees.
“It is difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons, because many key details are buried in the fine print of how ancillary fees, like ATM fees, will be charged,” said Chuck Bell, programs director at Consumer Reports.
Happily, banking customers who wish to avoid ATM fees do have options.
Many supermarkets, pharmacies and other businesses will dispense cash, without a fee, to customers who make store purchases with debit cards.
“I always get cash back from Publix,” Renter said. “When you’re grocery shopping, maybe once a week, you take out cash as well,” enough to last the week.
Many banks belong to broad ATM networks and partnerships that allow zero-fee withdrawals from ATMs that aren’t owned by the bank.
Capital One, for example, advertises that customers may withdraw money fee-free through the MoneyPass and Allpoint networks, including machines in some Target, Walgreens and CVS stores.
“It is worthwhile, sometimes, to call your bank and find out what your options are,” Renter said.
Many online banks, with little or no brick-and-mortar presence, will refund ATM fees charged by others.
USAA, for example, charges no ATM fees and offers up to $10 a month in rebates for fees charged by ATM owners.

“If you’re the kind of person who travels a lot,” Rossman said, “consider banking with somebody who will reimburse some or all of those.”
A $5 fee on a $20 ATM withdrawal amounts to a 25% surcharge: pretty steep.
Consider withdrawing more money, to lower the effective surcharge rate and put more cash in your pocket. As a surcharge rate on a $200 ATM withdrawal, that same $5 fee shrinks to 2.5%.
Choice Hotels International on Tuesday said it has offered to buy rival chain Wyndham Hotels & Resorts for nearly $8 billion.
The Maryland-based hotel operator shared details on its proposal after it said Wyndham walked away from nearly six months of merger discussions. Choice is offering to pay $90 per share in a mix of cash and stock, a deal valued at roughly $7.8 billion, or $9.8 billion when including debt. The proposal is a 30% premium to Wyndham's latest closing price.
"We have long respected Wyndham's business and are confident that this combination would significantly accelerate both Choice's and Wyndham's long-term organic growth strategy for the benefit of all stakeholders,” Choice President and CEO Patrick Pacious said in a statement.
A statement from Wyndham said it rejected the offer after determining that it was "not in the best interest of shareholders."
"Choice's offer is underwhelming, highly conditional, and subject to significant business, regulatory and execution risk," Wyndham Board of Directors Chairman Stephen Holmes said. "Choice has been unwilling or unable to address our concerns."
Choice Hotels currently operates 7,500 hotels across 46 countries and territories across brands like Radisson, Country Inn & Suites and Quality Inn, while Wyndham operates approximately 9,100 hotels across 95 countries across brands like Super 8, Days Inn and La Quinta. 
“The value-driven leisure and business traveler would benefit from the combined company's rewards program, which would be on par with the top two global hotel rewards programs, enabling them to receive greater value and access to a broader selection of options across stay occasions and price points," Pacious said. 
Timeshares:Timeshares are making a comeback with younger Americans, and here's the appeal.
Choice sent its initial proposal of $80 per share to Wyndham in April.
The deal was rejected, but Choice continued to try to persuade Wyndham by increasing its proposal to $85 per share – which resulted in a meeting between the companies’ boards and CEOs – and then $90 per share. 
But New Jersey-based Wyndham questioned Choice’s stock value and the timing for obtaining regulatory approvals, and pulled out of discussions, according to Choice’s statement. 
"A few weeks ago, Choice and Wyndham were in a negotiable range on price and consideration, and both parties have a shared recognition of the value opportunity this potential transaction represents,” Pacious said. “We were therefore surprised and disappointed that Wyndham decided to disengage.”
Pacious said the company decided to make its offer public because it believes “there is too much value for both companies' franchisees, shareholders, associates, and guests to not continue pursuing this transaction.”
But Wyndham's board disagrees. Its statement called the offer "opportunistic" and said it undervalues Wyndham's future growth potential. Holmes said the proposed transaction would likely take more than a year to determine if it could clear antitrust review, and Choice "was unable to address these long-term risks to Wyndham's business and shareholders."
"We are disappointed that Choice's description of our engagement disingenuously suggests that we were in alignment on core terms and omits to describe the true reasons we have consistently questioned the merits of this combination – Choice's inability and unwillingness to address our significant concerns about regulatory and execution risk and our deep concerns about the value of their stock," Holmes said.
Choice Hotels shares were down over 5% at 12:31 p.m. Eastern, trading at $118.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Wyndham shares were up over 7% at $74.32.
A proposed ruling filed from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could mean bans on some chemical hair-smoothing and straightening products that have been linked to cancer.
The FDA has proposed a rule banning formaldehyde and other formaldehyde-releasing chemicals from being used in hair-smoothing and straightening products sold in the U.S.
The use of such chemicals has been linked to long-term health concerns, including an increased risk of cancer, according to the FDA. They can also cause short-term health risks, including sensitization reactions and breathing problems, the agency says.
Before an FDA proposal can become an official rule, the agency takes comments from the public and then may "decide to end the rulemaking process, to issue a new proposed rule, or to issue a final rule," the agency's site says.
Maternity units closing in Alabama:Pregnant women have to travel further for care
A 2019 study published in the International Journal of Cancer linked hair dye and chemical straightener use to a risk of breast cancer in women in the U.S.
The link was further solidified in 2022, when the National Institutes of Health published a study that found women who used hair-straightening chemicals were associated with a higher uterine cancer risk, and that Black women may be more affected due to a higher use.
There has also been Congressional pressure to look into the link between chemical straighteners and cancer. In March 2023, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Massachusetts) and Rep. Shontel Brown (D-Ohio) wrote a letter to FDA Commissioner Robert Califf asking the agency conduct an investigation into the matter.
"We urge the FDA to investigate the potential health threat posed by chemical hair straightening products," the letter reads. "Consumers need to be reassured that the cosmetic products they use do not threaten their health. It is critical that the agency act quickly to address these legitimate concerns."
In a news release following the FDA's proposed new rule, Pressley called it "a win for public health — especially the health of Black women who are disproportionately put at risk by these products as a result of systemic racism and anti-Black hair sentiment,” 
DENVER — It’s difficult to overstate how good the 2024 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray is, or what an important step it constitutes for America’s great sports car. Now, maybe the world’s great sports car. Performance, design, technology, value: It’s hard to think of an area where the E-Ray isn't at least among the leaders.
All-wheel drive and hybrid-powered, the E-Ray is the biggest leap of imagination and engineering in the Corvette’s 70-year history. Ferrari 296 GTB, Audi R8, Porsche 911, McLaren Artura, Acura NSX, Nissan GT-R, Corvette. Take your pick. You’ll never get a consensus, but that’s the point: Each car is as good as it gets. The fun is in the debate, specifications, lap times and unforgettable road trips.
The ‘Vette’s last evolution, from front engine/rear-wheel drive to mid-engine for the 2020 model year, was child’s play by comparison. Chevy engineers had been kicking around proposals for mid- and rear-engine models for decades. That was a question of when, not if.
Building an electrified — not electric, there’s a difference; the E-Ray is a hybrid that combines a classic small-block V8 driving the rear wheels with an electrically powered front axle — ‘Vette with all-wheel drive was a choice dictated by physics and advances in engineering. Locating the engine's weight over the rear wheels improves traction. Powering the front axle with a small, efficient electric motor provides instant torque and precise control.
The program began before and was separate from the Ultium electric motors and batteries GM developed for 100% electric vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq, and Chevy Silverado EV pickup. It’s also unrelated to the inexpensive Chevy Bolt.
The E-Ray was part of the plan for the eighth generation C8 model from the start. That’s why its lithium-ion battery fits tidily in the center tunnel, and why the front electric motor and reworked steering and suspension don’t reduce space in the car’s front trunk.

The E-Ray’s bodywork is virtually identical to the Corvette Z06, with the exception of name badges and a logo that adds a pair of openings — opinion varies as to whether they’re eyes or gills — to the stylized stingray’s dorsal surface. The E-Ray is 3 inches wider than a Stingray, with staggered 20- and 21-inch wheels.
Chevy explains the distinction between the two models thus:
The E-Ray is faster 0-60 mph — if the difference between its 2.5 seconds and the Z06’s 2.6, as measured by Chevrolet, is a deal breaker for you. The track-ready Z06 covers a standing quarter-mile in 10.6 seconds and hits 130 mph, while the E-Ray slouches through it in 10.5 and 129 mph. Of such distinctions are buying decisions made, particularly when you’re dealing with some of the most passionate and informed car buyers on Earth.
If you haven’t been keeping up with “Planet Earth” on BBC, the name E-Ray is a riff on ‘Vette’s stingray heritage: There’s also an electric ray, a sleek sea creature that generates up to 220 volts to defend itself or stun prey.
Getting the front axle’s electric motor and the rear wheels’ 6.2L V8 to work together seamlessly at thousands of revolutions per minute — while simultaneously diving into curves and managing inputs from the steering system, eight-speed transmission and Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes — was one of the most daunting challenges GM engineers have tackled. And remember, this is the company that developed Lunar Rovers for the Apollo program.
“It’s the most complicated consumer product you can buy,” Corvette executive chief engineer Tadge Juechter told me as he pointed out details of the exposed mechanicals in a cutaway E-Ray in an airport hangar outside Denver. “Electrification increases the driver’s feeling of control and composure in all conditions.”
The E-Ray’s sensors also interpret steering angle and pedal inputs to determine the driver’s intent and keep the car on course and at speed. The electric all-wheel drive system dispenses torque for secure traction accelerating out of curves.
The 6.2L V8 engine produces 495 hp that go to the rear wheels, via the same eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that powers all current Corvettes. An electric motor located under the front trunk delivers another 160 hp.
There’s no physical connection between the two drivetrains, which must operate in harmony at all speeds, road surfaces and conditions.
The Acura NSX, which ended production last year, was the only other supercar with independently powered front and rear ends. Its front wheels are driven by two separate electric motors. A turbocharged V6 and electric motor power the rear. The NSX developed 600 hp and accelerated to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds. Prices started at $169,500.

I found the E-Ray remarkably easy to drive over two days that included highways, twisting mountain roads north of Denver and a tight slalom course at Pikes Peak International Raceway, 90 miles south of the city.
The power comes on with smooth precision, the steering is responsive and neutral, the ride surprisingly comfortable over bumps.
An adaptive magnetic ride suspension kept the car level in fast launches and hard braking, and firmly planted in fast maneuvers, including a tire-smoking drifting session the E-Ray could have maintained until the the tread fell off or the tank ran dry.
Speaking of running without gasoline, the electric front axle provides a "stealth mode," with speeds up to 45 mph when leaving home or driving through the neighborhood.
The electric motor also extends the V8’s four-cylinder operating mode on the highway, reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The 655-hp E-Ray avoided the gas-guzzler tax, scoring the same 19 mpg EPA rating in combined city and highway driving as a 490-hp, gasoline-only Stingray.
The E-Ray’s weight distribution is 42% over the front axle, 58% over the rear, a couple of percentage points more over the nose than the base ‘Vette, but “still in the sweet spot’” for acceleration and handling, Juechter said.
The interior is luxuriously trimmed in leather, suede and carbon fiber. The touch screen includes performance displays.

For a lot of amateur or busy family chefs, chicken is an easy go-to dinner option. Tacos, enchiladas, chicken noodle soup, or even a salad, chicken is a classic centerpiece to a quality meal. 
Once you have decided on your choice of meal (which is the hardest part), it is time to prepare your chicken. Not only is boiling chicken faster and easier than roasting or grilling it, but it is also a safer way to ensure your chicken will be juicy without drying out, according to Better Homes & Garden. 
Regardless if you have boned or boneless chicken, here is how long it takes to boil it to perfection.
Ideally, the chicken will be done once it has reached 165 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service. However, here are a few timing guidelines you can follow if you are unsure, based on chicken type.
Need a side dish?:Add this 'healthiest' vegetable into your diet
It is advised that you thaw the chicken first before boiling it frozen. If able, leave the chicken in a fridge for at least nine hours. 
If unable, the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service recommends boiling frozen chicken 50% longer in time than already thawed chicken. 
Cook for about 30 minutes, or 45 minutes if frozen, according to Better Homes & Garden.
Cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, or 18 to 22 minutes if frozen, according to Better Homes & Garden.
Step 1: Select a liquid
Based on your overall meal, you can boil your chicken in a variety of ways. Whether you want to boil in water or something more flavorful like chicken broth, there is no wrong answer as long as you have a liquid in the pot.
Step 2: Season up
Place your chicken in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid that has enough liquid to cover the chicken. Add any additional seasonings, such as salt and pepper. This is a good time to add any vegetables or fresh herbs that you want to be included because the boiling water can really bring those savory flavors out, Delish reports. 
Step 3: Begin to boil
After the chicken is covered up in your chosen liquid and additional flavors, bring your water to a boil. Cover the pot with your tight-fitting lid, slightly lowering the heat once the water is boiling.
Leave your chicken to simmer in the pot until the internal temperature is 165 degrees Fahrenheit (this can be checked with a meat thermometer). If your chicken seems to need more time, check every 5 minutes and avoid overcooking so the chicken doesn’t become rubbery, according to Delish.

Turning your keys in the ignition, only to realize your car battery died is an irritation most people experience at one time or another. This can happen because the headlights were left on, extreme outside weather or your car battery needs a simple replacement, according to Firestone Complete Auto Care.
Jumping a car can be a daunting task, but as long as you come prepared with the required and recommended equipment as well as an additional car to jump the dead battery, you’ll be back on the highway again in no time.
Geico provides a list of the equipment necessary for jumping a car. You will need jumper cables to jump the car, gloves and coveralls for protection, a flashlight to identify the correct parts of the car and the owner’s manual. Also required is another car with a charged battery.

To define is to limit. NCT 127 lives by that motto, and the boy group is constantly evolving, whether it be their experimental sound, complex choreographies, or intricate concepts.
Since its debut, NCT 127 has defied expectations in each release, becoming globally known for its signature "neo" style. Their latest album, "Fact Check," out now, underscores the diverse sonic range of the nine-member band.
"We really put all of our hearts in it," Johnny told USA TODAY about the group's fifth album.
NCT 127 debuted in July 2016 with EP "NCT #127" and lead single "Fire Truck." The group is under the greater umbrella that is NCT, which stands for Neo Culture Technology. Others include NCT U, NCT DREAM, NCT DOJAEJUNG, WayV and a soon-to-debut Japan-based group.
Composed of Taeil (who was absent from the interview due to an injury), Taeyong, Johnny, Yuta, Doyoung, Jaehyun, Jungwoo, Mark and Haechan, NCT 127 is based in Seoul. The latter half of its name represents the longitudinal coordinate of the city.
While the group actively promotes in South Korea, their reach is worldwide. They've toured the globe, received top awards and released chart-hitting records, cementing their spot within an ever-changing industry. The group's last album "2 Baddies" debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, making NCT 127 the second K-pop artist in history to land three albums in the Top 5.
The multitude of talents of NCT 127 can't be boxed into a specific definition or genre. Fans often refer to the group using "네오하다," which translates to "it's really neo," said Johnny.
"Fact Check" embodies this phrase, featuring the pop rock "Angel Eyes" to smooth R&B "Misty." The nine tracks capture NCT 127's ethos.
"Being as diverse as we can be and being very limitless with our music and our styles, that's the approach we've always had when we start making a new album," said Mark.
"We continue to study in terms of performance, understanding in music, and what concept we'd like to showcase through the tracks. I think that's how we maintain the diversity in concept," said Taeyong, the group's leader.
While working on "Fact Check," Mark said the members considered not only the audible aspect but also the performance side.
"We wanted to create another great album that would be amazing not just to hear, but to also see on stage," he explained.
The title track, in particular, leans into the group's innovative nature through its kinetic choreography and vibrant tonality. Its music video also gives a nod to NCT 127's base with traditional Korean settings. "We went more into our origins throughout the whole title song," said Jaehyun.
Taeyong contributed to its choreography, calling the experience a "really good memory."
NCT 127 has experienced a lot over the years. They even got to share some of those stories in the docuseries, "NCT 127: The Lost Boys."
"We shared deep secrets, stories that we really didn't say out loud," Mark said. "To share that vulnerability with our audience is something that is great for us to treasure."
Reflecting on growth, each member has developed in his own way.
Haechan shared how he's grown vocally. "I tend to learn how I can use my voice a bit better and also how to use that into the songs," he said.
For Yuta, he said his confidence has shifted over time. This sentiment was echoed by others.
"Since I joined the team in the middle, I thought I had a lot of lacking points that I had to develop," said Jungwoo, who joined NCT 127 in 2018. "Since the debut, I think now I gained a lot of confidence and also I try to break my limits all the time."
Taeyong said he has gained strength and a better mindset from his members. "When I was young, I was a really sensitive person. It's like I'm so badly pushing myself," he said. "Now, I'm really positive. My members are really helping me."
A humble mentality resonates throughout NCT 127. They strive to become better people as a whole, said Taeyong.
"Since debut, there's always limits to when you try to put out some parts that are not close to yourself," Doyoung said. "Right now, I'm trying more hard to be a good person and I think I have become one."
And this process never stops. "I'm always learning more and more about myself," said Johnny. "I am figuring out or have figured out a lot about what I think is important, what I find important, what I think are my priorities."
NCT 127 has a deep devotion to its fans, whom they lovingly refer to as NCTzens. In all that they do, the members wish to foster connections with them.
"We want them to remember us as they did the time that they had the warmth in themselves," said Jaehyun, hoping NCTzens hold onto the memories they create together.
As for their music, NCT 127 wants to continue pushing boundaries. "We will never stop our challenges on the musical side," said Doyoung.
And across the board, NCT 127's "future seems limitless," said Yuta.

Before Oct. 7, my brother, his girlfriend and his kids were just parts of my greater identity and what I love and hold dear in this world. Now, as I live through a waking nightmare in which they have been taken hostage by Hamas − this part of my identity consumes me. And it's what drives and will drive my every action and thought, until my family comes home. 
My heart is heavy with sorrow, anger and, most of all, a profound sense of helplessness after an act so horrific and brutal that we never could have imagined it. 
Hell began for us when my wife and I called my brother, Yair Yaakov, during the first round of missile attacks the morning of Oct. 7, to check in on him; his girlfriend, Meirav Tal; and my two nephews, who are 16 and 12. They live in Nir Oz, a kibbutz in southern Israel, near the Gaza border. 
My brother reassured my wife that they were in their shelter/safe room. His two sons were staying at their mother’s house, and my brother, no matter how much he may have wished he could race to the rest of his family and bring them all together to protect them, couldn’t leave the safe room in his house at the kibbutz.
We survived the Hamas attack on Israel.What haunts us now is the blockade of Gaza.
They were strictly instructed to stay in place, and they heard gunshots outside the house. Everyone was frozen as they faced the approaching fear and horror of Hamas terrorists closing in. 
About a half hour later, Meirav sent us an audio message on WhatsApp. Her voice was shaking as she told us that terrorists had entered their home. Yair held the shelter’s door to keep the attackers out. But in the end, he did not prevail. This was the last time we had contact with them. 
Our family was thrown into darkness. We searched every minute of that day for any sign of them. We tried using Apple’s “Find my iPhone” feature to no avail. We fought fear and panic all day to remain focused on locating our family. 
Later that afternoon, the mother of my nephews shared with us through tears that she had confirmation that her two sons had been kidnapped. Our world collapsed around us.
For nearly 30 agonizing hours, we had no idea where any of them were. We reached out to every level of every authority we could, asking for help in finding Yair, Meirav and my nephews. The silence that returned became overwhelming as we learned that we were going to face this nightmare primarily on our own. We turned to social media, sharing pictures and heartfelt pleas, hoping someone in our connected web would come forward with information.
Then we learned the fate of my family when a friend of Yair shared a video showing that Hamas had taken them hostage. It showed the terrifying moments of Yair and Meirav's abduction after Hamas terrorists threw grenades to break the safe room’s door. 
This wasn't just a crime; it was an inversion of humanity. Innocent people, including children and women, were forcibly taken from their homes where they should feel safe and torn away from their lives, their families and their communities. They are now pawns in a war.

The days since have been dark with just one glimmer of light. Yair's oldest daughter and her boyfriend, who were staying in yet another house in the kibbutz, managed to keep their shelter secure and were eventually rescued by the Israel Defense Forces.
As a family, we appeal to the world for one thing: the safe return of our loved ones. We were brought up to believe that everyone has a family and deserves to be treated humanely. Hamas operates in stark contrast to these principles.
Our only plea is to bring our kidnapped family members back home safely. We don’t know if they are being fed. We don’t know the state of their health. We don’t know where they are. The uncertainty about their fate is what our lives are defined by now, and we are desperate for the day that we can receive good news about their well-being. 
Until then, I am a brother and an uncle who refuses to give up.

This time, I almost gave up the hope that one day, people will see the humanity in Palestinians, my people. See the humanity in me.
As if the number of innocent civilians killed in the latest war between Israel and Hamas hasn’t been horrifying enough, the count continues to rise.
The sheer number of bombs Israel dropped in five days is more than the United States dropped in Afghanistan in a year after 9/11, The Washington Post reported.
Condemnation of the killing of innocent Palestinian and Israeli civilians should be easy to come by, yet I watch in frustration as Palestinians are dehumanized, as if their lives are less valuable.
I’ve felt this frustration before – too many times. The pain of feeling less than human is never less gut-wrenching. I feel this rage and sadness, but I harness that. It drives what I do, who I am.
And instead of waiting for people to see Palestinians as humans, I have the power to show them. As journalists, we have a duty to expose injustice, to think critically. To show humanity.
As a woman living in diaspora, I watch events in the Palestinian territories from afar while my family there lives through it.
March 30, 2018, marked the beginning of the monthslong Great March of Return, when tens of thousands of Palestinians came together to protest across Gaza, the West Bank and within Israel’s borders.
They demanded the end of Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip, the end of its now 75-year brutal military occupation that human rights groups have described as apartheid, and the return of the 750,000 Palestinians expelled from their homes to make way for the creation of Israel in 1948.
Today, there are an estimated 6 million Palestinian refugees.
I did what I always do when Palestinians dare demand their right to live freely: I checked on my family in the West Bank to make sure they were safe.
And then, my stomach already in knots, I braced myself for what was to come.
Israel responded to these protests in 2018 by using live ammunition on peaceful protesters, the United Nations reported, sniping down women, children, journalists and medics, along with tear gas, rubber bullets, drones; 214 Palestinians were killed, 46 of them children. More than 36,100 Palestinians were injured, including about 8,800 children. One in 5 were injured by live ammunition.
Watching these events unfold in horror and devastation, I remember thinking to myself, maybe this time the world will get it. Palestinians just want to live. We want to be regarded as human. And even when protesting peacefully, Palestinians still pay the price in blood.
Looking back, I realize I was naive.
Overwhelmed by the war in Israel?Here's how to protect your mental health.
Just a few months earlier, 17-year-old Ahed Tamimi was sentenced to eight months in Israeli prison for slapping Israeli soldiers. She was protesting the expansion of Israeli settlements – illegal under international law – near her village, Nabi Saleh. Her cousin, 15 at the time, was injured after an Israeli soldier shot him in the head with a rubber bullet at close range.
I feel such frustration that a child was imprisoned for eight months, in a country the United States supports and in which there is little challenge to these practices and policies by the news media, the Israeli government or our own government.
In 2021, thousands of Palestinians across the region again erupted in peaceful protest against the expulsion of eight Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Tensions were already high following an Israeli police raid on worshippers praying during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan at Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam’s holiest sites. (The image of Palestinians beaten by Israeli forces has been juxtaposed with images of the soldiers protecting Israelis as they marched chanting “death to Arabs” during that same time.)
More than 2 million Palestinians are trapped in Gaza under a 16-year Israeli siege, now subjected to repeated bombings described by the U.N. as collective punishment.
After the Sheikh Jarrah protests two years ago, I remember thinking to myself, in deep pain and frustration: Maybe people will see the daily realities that Palestinians live through – like forced expulsions, even Israeli settlers taking over Palestinian homes while Palestinians still live in them, and boasting about it in the media.
Last year, when prominent veteran Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed – likely by an Israeli sniper while covering the near-daily raids and killings of Palestinians – maybe, I thought, the image of those carrying Abu Akleh in a casket, almost dropping it as Israeli police beat them, would be enough for people to understand what Palestinians live through.
Or even now, maybe the news of entire neighborhoods, entire families, obliterated by Israel’s bombs in the latest war between Israel and Hamas – and now Israel’s order for the forced evacuation of more than a million people from northern Gaza, which the U.N. calls an impending humanitarian crisis – would be enough to show people just how unequal this war really is.
Maybe the 6,000 Israeli bombs that have hit Gaza since Oct. 7 would be enough to remind people that Israel occupies Palestinian territories, subjecting them to violent oppression for the last 75 years.
Or maybe the Israeli minster of defense calling Palestinians “human animals” when he ordered “complete siege” on the 2 million people of Gaza – cutting off water, electricity, fuel and food as hospitals are bombed and on the verge of collapse – would spark some sympathy.
'Take a lesson from the dead':Fatal stabbing of 6-year-old serves warning to divided US
It can feel lonely and empty to see others disregard your humanity. To paint your people with the broad brush of terrorism.
I’ve witnessed my mother strip-searched and thrown in an Israeli detention cell for trying to visit the country she was born in, told never to fly through Ben Gurion airport again, simply because she is Palestinian.
I’ve seen the separation wall. I’ve heard the gunfire. I’ve driven segregated roads.
I’ve seen Palestinian homes bulldozed in East Jerusalem, settlements built right in the middle of Palestinian neighborhoods, settlements that continue to expand, surrounding my family’s villages in the West Bank.
It’s injustice that I cannot unsee, I cannot unlive.
But Palestinians are strong, they are resilient. Both our strength and our suffering reminds me of why I’m a journalist. Because I’ve seen firsthand the oppression that Palestinians face, and I’ve lived it during every visit home. Interrogation by Israeli soldiers, and at military checkpoints, guns pointed at me by Israeli soldiers.
Palestinians protest even though they know that they can die, and they do it because they have no other choice. It's their freedom they're protesting for.
I have faith that journalists will find the bravery, as Palestinian journalists have, leading the way for humanity to be acknowledged – to ask these questions and think critically and demand that Palestinians be seen as worthy.
To see our humanity, our right to self-determination.
Our right to simply live.

I realize this may be asking a lot, but wouldn’t it be great if so many of our politicians weren’t unscrupulous creeps? 
These days, after scanning the headlines about the folks “running” the government, I often feel like I need a shower. 
It seems like an almost daily occurrence that a current or former elected official lands in court for one shady misdeed or another. Government corruption almost seems normal.
It shouldn’t be.
Between the alarming attack on Israel this month and the Republicans bungling their House leadership, some of the latest scandals have gotten the amount of attention they deserve.
Republicans fiddle while world burns:Listen up, Republicans. The world is in chaos, so why are you playing stupid games?
Let me refresh you on what’s been happening. 
The charges keep coming for Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey. A career politician to his core, Menendez has spent decades in Congress, between his time in the House and now the Senate. 
His seniority earned him the powerful position of chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which he is now charged with abusing for his personal gain. Menendez had to step down from that role while his case plays out, but he doesn’t appear to be leaving office anytime soon – at least of his own accord. 
Last week, Menendez was slapped with additional charges of conspiracy to act as a foreign agent. That is on top of last month's indictment on bribery charges. 
Stop and think about that: The (now former) chair of Foreign Relations, a committee that reviews treaties with other nations and votes on all diplomatic nominations, is accused of acting as a foreign agent for hire.
Harvard for Hamas?Something is very twisted on America's university campuses.
What he’s accused of is extremely serious. Menendez – along with his wife – is charged in part with benefiting the Egyptian government as well as several businessmen in exchange for hundreds of thousands in gold bars and cash. Some of the loot was found at his home – hidden in closets and clothes, which doesn’t seem suspicious at all.
And for good measure, throw in a Mercedes convertible worth more than $60,000, which prosecutors say business executives purchased for the senator and his wife in exchange for Menendez interfering in an insurance fraud case.
It's not the first time Menendez has had a run-in with the law involving bribery charges. In 2017, a federal jury deadlocked on whether to convict the senator, which led to a mistrial.
See a pattern here? 
Menendez, according to historians, may be the first sitting senator in U.S. history to have been indicted in two different criminal cases, a distinction no one should strive for. 
Now, if you’re a liberal, I can bet what you’re thinking: “Well, look at former President Donald Trump!” or “How about Rep. George Santos?” 
Trump has been indicted in four criminal cases, as well as a civil fraud case, all of which are unprecedented for a former president (who also is, of course, the leading Republican candidate for president in 2024). 
Time for change:Sure, Trump is awful. But that doesn't mean Biden is a good choice for president.
Then there's curious George. Last week, a new indictment alleges Santos stole the identities of campaign donors and used donors’ credit cards as his own personal piggy bank. That comes five months after he was charged with other financial crimes. 
It’s really no wonder that his campaign coffers are in arrears. 
There’s also the fact that Santos made up his entire résumé. He’s a first-class sleazebag. 
Yet, unlike Menendez, Santos is a freshman congressman, one who is unlikely to make it to his sophomore term (assuming voters are paying attention). 
Menendez had a position of leadership and real power, and Democrats kept promoting him despite earlier warning signs. What Menendez is accused of doing deserves to be scrutinized on its own accord. 
Bribing for access:Menendez indictment raises questions about Hunter Biden case – and DOJ
The question remains: What to do with these bad actors? 
It’s easy for Democrats to scream and yell that Santos is a disgrace and must go. And Republicans like to do the same to Democrats. For instance, Republicans have called for Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a Democrat from New York, to be expelled from the House after he pulled a fire alarm before a key vote to keep the government open. Bowman says it was a "mistake," and his office released a memo in his defense that labeled Republicans as "Nazis."
Regardless, it’s an odd “mistake” for a former school principal to make and a bizarre incident, even if it doesn’t rise to the level of expulsion. But I digress. 
The bar for expelling a House member is high, and it has only happened a few times in our country’s history. Of the 15 times the Senate has expelled a member, 14 occurred during the Civil War for supporting the Confederacy. 
Unfortunately, partisanship often comes before principle. The fact remains that with thin margins of control in the House and Senate, both sides need as many warm bodies as they can get, regardless of how repugnant. 
Some New York Republicans have called for the House to expel Santos, although that’s not likely to happen. The same goes for the Senate. Quite a few Democrats have called on Menendez to resign, but they’re not likely to take the matter further. 
At the least, Menendez and Santos could be censured by their colleagues and face that embarrassment. 
These men deserve their day in court, but I'm less certain they should be roaming the halls of Congress.
The surest way to rid the government of (alleged) weasels is for voters to make sure they don’t get the chance again.

Great news, America. Criminal defendant and leading GOP presidential primary candidate Donald Trump has something new to whine about – a partial gag order placed on him by the federal judge in his election interference case.
If you thought Trump’s yearslong journey to become the sorest of sore losers by ceaselessly braying about the 2020 presidential election he lost was growing tiresome, just you wait. Monday’s order provides fresh fodder for his persecution cannon, which I’m sure will be red hot from firing as the former president processes the fact that he, like anyone facing criminal charges, can’t freely intimidate witnesses, prosecutors or court personnel.
In issuing the order, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said: “Mr. Trump can certainly claim he’s being unfairly prosecuted, but I cannot imagine any other case where a defendant is allowed to call the prosecution ‘deranged,’ a ‘thug’ or anything else.”
She added: “His political campaign does not give him carte blanche to vilify public servants for simply doing their job.”
Setting aside the remarkable fact that a federal judge sees credible concerns that the far-and-away front-runner for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination is attempting to intimidate witnesses and prosecutors in his own criminal case, consider the way we’d expect Trump to respond to Chutkan’s decision.
Something along the lines of: “A CRAZY RADICAL LEFTIST MARXIST TRUMP-HATING ‘JUDGE’ has now totally violated my CONSTITUTIONAL rights by issuing a ‘gag order’ on me in what everyone knows is ELECTION INTERFERENCE led by Crazy Joe Biden and his boss, Barack HUSSEIN Obama. FIGHT BACK!”
I made that all up, but would you be surprised if Trump wrote something similar? And if you wouldn't be surprised, doesn't that suggest we're facing a serious problem?
Immediately after the ruling, Trump posted on Truth Social: "A TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED TO DEMOCRACY TODAY – GAG ORDER!" and "WILL APPEAL THE GAG ORDER RULING. WITCH HUNT!"
There's little doubt the angry rants will get worse.
Be honest Republican voters.Is Trump really what you want?
Prior to the gag order, Trump had labeled special counsel Jack Smith “a crackhead” and called him “psycho.”
In August, Trump posted what prosecutors viewed as a threat against witnesses, writing: “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU!”
And in a Sept. 22 post on Truth Social, Trump accused retired Gen. Mark Milley, a former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and now a witness in the election interference case, of treason and suggested that he should be executed.
Prosecutors, in their filing requesting a gag order, wrote that “no other criminal defendant would be permitted to issue public statements insinuating that a known witness in his case should be executed; this defendant should not be, either.”
Judge muzzles Trump:McCarthy booted from House speaker, Trump gagged. The Republican Party is an unserious mess.
Trump will squeal desperately and claim his free-speech rights are being trampled, but even a low-functioning mollusk would know that’s nonsense.
Trump was president, true. He isn’t anymore.
Trump is running for president, true. But that doesn’t give him the freedom to say whatever the hell he wants about people involved in the multiple criminal cases in which he faces 91 state and federal felony charges.
I’m not above the law, you’re not above the law and Trump, sad as it may be for him to learn, is not above the law.
But at least now he has some new material to work with. When your very essence is defined by aggrievement, a legal setback provides fresh paint for your victimhood self-portrait.
Let’s see how long it takes the whiner in chief to violate the judge’s gag order. I’m guessing it comes in 3, 2, 1 …

Rabbi Igael Gurin-Malous grew up in an Orthodox home, spending time in Belgium, Israel and the United States. Today, he's a gay, tattooed, non-denominational rabbi living in New York.
Most of the people he went to Jewish boys school with are right-wing. This week, those same peers bullied him in group chats. They called him a Hebrew word meaning a traitor to the other side. Because he "dared to" suggest that Israel's current military response in Gaza "is not the only way to to address the (Israeli-Palestinian conflict)."
His situation resembles many across the U.S. and rest of the world as people grapple with differing opinions among friends, family and colleagues; A college group text devolving because no one can agree. Millennials walking on eggshells for fear of upsetting their Gen Z partners.
There's no one way to approach sensitive issues of this nature. But experts say those aiming to preserve relationships fractured by the war between Israel and Hamas should tread lightly.
"Reactions like rage and heartbreak are normal," says Kimberly Vered Shashoua, a licensed clinical social worker. "If you’re feeling too overwhelmed with your own emotions, that’s OK. Just let your partner or loved ones know you need some time or space before you are up for having deep conversations."
Emotions have been running high since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7; 4,200 have died on both sides, according to the United Nations.
"It's creating these distances that people feel unseen, unheard, vilified," Gurin-Malous says.
Many have expressed their fears and frustrations on social media in an effort to empathize and seek personal connections to tragedies in lieu of or in addition to private conversations. Maybe to alleviate guilt, to feel like they're doing something, to "perform" uneducated solidarity.
These posts often go awry when people play the comparison game. "The problem is not the desire to find a personal connection," says Benjamin Goldman, licensed mental health counselor. "The problem is when conversations become about comparing degrees of suffering and pain. And during this time that we're in right now, there's a lot of data and a lot of real information." Anyone can throw statistics at a situation to try and justify their points. But many aren't really looking for meaningful conversation
Aziz Abu-Sarah's octogenarian parents live in Jerusalem. He visited them there three weeks ago. Now, he's afraid for their safety. A Palestinian peacemaker, his Israeli and Palestinian friends have been asking him how to broker dialogue.
"My advice was this: refrain (from) political discussions," he says. "Don't talk heavy politics right now. You always do, you will eventually, but now, maybe is not the time to start going into what happened 100 years ago and 50 years ago. This is just the wrong time for that."
Before engaging with someone on as sensitive a topic as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, consider who you are talking to (i.e. where do they fall on the issue) and have a goal in mind. Are you looking to vent? For a dialogue? To change their mind?
Because "if you're looking for a conversation that takes place in a shared experience in pain, and then you go to someone with a conflicting experience from you to have that conversation, you will be hurt," Goldman says. "And they will also probably be hurt." That said, "if you must share information that you feel very strongly about, it’s best to adopt a non-confrontational attitude – even if you believe you are right," says Cecille Ahrens, a licensed clinical social worker.
It may also be worth some introspection. "We would be wise to remember that we are each a product of our own lived experience steeped in the culture that surrounds us," says Laura Petiford, a licensed marriage and family therapist. "Additionally, we are influenced by the media's synthesis of information and the mediums we trust to deliver it to our screens and inboxes."
Focus less on politics and more on the personal if you're aiming for a productive conversation. "Try and connect from a human perspective on fear and isolation, and not being seen, and all the other emotions that we all feel whenever there is war," Gurin-Malous says.
Abu-Sarah adds: "Being vulnerable for each other and being willing to listen, instead of being quick to fight and argue – this is true in all situations."
He suggests focusing less on your position at the start of a dialogue and more on your story: "Before we start taking positions: 'Here why I stand (for Israel's) right to defend itself; here's why I stand for Palestinians' right to end occupation.' Before you say, your position, tell your story. It's more important."
Consider, too, "is there any common ground from which you can start?" asks Regine Galanti, a clinical psychologist. "Can you agree that all civilian deaths are terrible and tragic? That it's not OK to kidnap women and children? That it's terrible for people not to have access to basic utilities? Again, if you have no common ground, it might not be a conversation worth having right now."
You are also allowed to hit pause if you're not ready to talk just yet. "It's OK to avoid conversations with friends or family if you're not  emotionally in the right place for these disagreements," Galanti adds. "I've been muting a lot of my Instagram stories – even of people that I agree with – because I go to Instagram to unwind, and the constant barrage of videos on the Israeli-Gaza conflict make me anxious instead."
Watch out:Israel, Gaza and when your social media posts hurt more than help
Some relationships may not survive disagreements of this nature. And that is OK, too.
For Gurin-Malous, some wounds won't scar. They'll sit as open wounds.
"Some of the damage that has been done to me, and some of the relationships that I have around this, I think are irreparable," he says. "You can't unsay things you've said. And with that, I also want to allow for the fact that this is a very hot button (issue) for everybody involved." Still, "I want to also bring some compassion to the fact that sometimes we say things that we don't mean. And sometimes we out of fear lash out. And it is unfortunate, I think that many, many times, we reserve our worst behavior for the people we love the most."
Remember, as Abu-Sarah says: "Behind every angry statement, behind every talking point we throw at each other, there's a hurt person."
In case you missed:The videos out of Israel, Gaza are graphic, but some can't look away: How to cope
We always want what we don’t have, whether it’s a different hair color or longer lashes. Now, in what appears to be the rebirth of a beauty trend with a storied history, people are giving themselves pseudo dimples — and not the surgical kind, which yes, is a thing.
Behold the “dimple maker”: a cherry-shaped device with a curved wire sporting marble-like balls on each end. All you have to do, according to people on TikTok, is pry the device open and slip it onto your cheek as the balls clamp the inner and outer sides together. 
Over time, the device may leave impressions on the muscles and fat pads in your cheek, although plastic surgeons who spoke to USA TODAY aren’t convinced they’ll last long. Doctors came to the same conclusion nearly 90 years ago after a woman named Isabelle Gilbert invented a similar product.
Today, interest persists and is growing. The hashtag #dimplemaker has over 60 million views on TikTok, with the devices springing up on Etsy and other shops for about $15. 
Dimple makers are relatively safe, and are a less invasive alternative to a dimpleplasty — the surgical removal of muscle inside the cheek to create dimples — but experts say that they may still pose risks, such as permanent nerve damage and scarring.
“You want to be careful with home remedies and fads because nobody's counseling you about complications,” said Dr. Alan Matarasso, board vice president of development for the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. “You especially have to be careful with anything on the face that's not reversible.”
Dimple makers compress the skin and underlying fat in the cheek, squeezing fluid out of surrounding tissue and creating a temporary inward dent, according to Dr. Jonathan Kaplan, a plastic surgeon with Pacific Heights Plastic Surgery in San Francisco, California, who likens the device to a waist trainer. 
It’s unclear how long it takes to work, but results will vary depending on how tight the clamp is, how long it’s worn and the amount of fat in the cheek, experts say. 
Dimple makers can be helpful if you’re interested in getting a dimpleplasty, Kaplan said, because you can see how you’ll look with dimples and what placement best suits your face. 
Dimple makers that are too tight and worn for too long could potentially restrict blood flow to the spot on the cheek that’s being compressed, leading to the death of fat tissue (necrosis), Kaplan said.
A hard lump could develop in your cheek as a result, but it’s unlikely to be noticeable from the outside and can go away with time, Kaplan said. If enough blood supply is cut off, your skin cells in the area could die, which can leave a scab and scar. 
A more unlikely yet still plausible risk of wearing dimple makers is nerve damage in the face, which could theoretically lead to paralysis in the upper and lower lip, Matarasso  said, giving you a "I just had a cavity filled at the dentist"-type of smile. 
“When you put pressure on a nerve, you have a certain amount of time until the nerve dies and then it's not reversible,” Matarasso said. “Think of it as a wet match — sometimes it'll dry off, but if you soak that match enough, it's never going to strike a fire.”
Dimplepasties carry similar risks because a surgical knife could pierce a nerve, but the likelihood of that happening is “extraordinarily low,” Matarasso said. Dimple makers, on the other hand, may pose greater risks of nerve damage because you’re compressing a larger surface area of the cheek, he added. 
However, Kaplan speculates that most people wouldn’t be able to tolerate the pain associated with these kinds of injuries for long enough to sustain any kind of permanent damage. 
As dimple makers become more popular, it's far from uncommon for 26-year-old Miya Ulatowski, who was born with dimples, to be accused of faking hers: “When I first started seeing those comments, it threw me off because I didn’t even know dimple surgery was a thing.”
While Ulatowski doesn’t understand dimples’ appeal, the Ohio resident said that she’s “a big supporter of people doing whatever they need to feel happy and confident in how they look.” 
Meanwhile, people who opt for a dimpleplasty are frequently bombarded with hate about their decision to pursue the procedure. Merissa Fernandes, 32, of Massachusetts, said she has received pushback online since undergoing surgery in June, but acknowledges that it’s a consequence of being open about body modifications. 
“I’ve always adored people who had dimples, so I got the surgery because I wanted to,” Fernandes said. “I’m not doing anything for the opinions of others, I just think it’s valuable to be as transparent as possible.”  
Interest in bodybuilding has skyrocketed since the pandemic began. Searches for "bodybuilding" or "weightlifting" apps have grown by over 190% year over year, according to Google Trends data. Among the most popular bodybuilding gym exercises that people seek out are squats, dumbbells and deadlifts. But one analysis shows that by far the most popular weightlifting exercise – among both men and women – is the bench press. 
The bench press is such a sought-after piece of gym equipment because the workout produces the kind of results bodybuilders are after, it's a straightforward exercise that's easy to do and because it offers a host of other health benefits beyond muscle growth alone.
Like many forms of resistance training, the bench press requires the use of some basic gym equipment. These include a workout bench to lay back on, a long barbell that sits atop a secure rack frame on both sides of the bench, and weight plates of varying poundage that are added to each side of the barbell in equal amounts and then secured with clips at each end. 
Once the right equipment is in place, getting the most out of the exercise requires good form. Jackie Miller, a certified IRONMAN and USA Triathlon coach who has been advising athletes for 18 years, says the trick to proper bench press form is sticking to the following steps: 
"Once you feel fatigue such as muscle burn or feeling overly tired, it's time to rack the weight," says Melanie Adams, an American College of Sports Medicine certified exercise physiologist and a professor of exercise science at Keene State College in New Hampshire.
Done properly, the exercise works several muscle groups, but its primary target is the pectoralis major, often called pecs. "This is the large, fan-shaped muscle on top of our ribs and over our chest," says Adams. She explains that the job of these chest muscles is to help move one's shoulders and control movement of both arms across the front of the body.
The bench press works other muscles, too. "The triceps get some good stress as well as the exercise extends the elbow," Adams explains. So do assisting muscles such as deltoids, biceps, forearm muscles, rib muscles, "and the latissimus dorsi, which stabilize the wrist and shoulder blades."
The exercise is also unique because it can be adjusted to target each muscle group more extensively.
Lifting from an inclined workout bench will target one's upper chest muscles, while decline bench-pressing movements will target one's lower chest muscles, explains Dr. Matthew Best, director of research in the sports medicine division at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. At either setting, however, "it's important to avoid trying to lift too much weight or performing the exercise too rapidly, which can predispose to injury," he adds.
More on squats:Squat challenges are all over social media. What muscles does the exercise work?
Beyond increased upper-body strength in each of these muscle groups, bench pressing has other health benefits as well. These include improved stamina and endurance, increased mobility and some research shows that the exercise can also increase bone density.
Performing the exercise also partly satisfies the physical activity recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For optimal health and strength, the agency recommends 75 to 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity each week in addition to muscle strengthening activities at least twice a week. 
Maintaining such levels of physical activity, the CDC notes, can improve one's brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease and improve one's ability to do everyday activities. "Many people are initially interested in weightlifting to increase muscle size, but quickly learn our muscles are involved in all kinds of hormonal interactions like lowering inflammation, stopping stress response and growing brain cells," explains Adams. "Building both muscular endurance and muscular strength throughout the body pays off for your health."

Suzanne Somers has died at the age of 76, and the loss has been felt among fans around the world.
"Devastated to hear about the passing of Suzanne Somers," @marc_k011 wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. "A true icon and overall amazing human being."
"I'm truthfully devastated with the death of Suzanne Somers. She was a great actress, but had a deeper heart in life," @MichaelKerner20 wrote. "She was a sweetheart!!!"
Grief is different for everyone, and experts say mourning someone you didn't personally know − a phenomenon called collective or public grief − is a complicated, yet valid, experience.
"Collective and public grief, as I call it, is always unique in how we attach," David Kessler, grief expert and founder of Grief.com, previously told USA TODAY.
This form of grief can be further compounded when the death of a beloved public figure is read about unexpectedly in the news.
"When people experience sudden loss, they may feel shocked, disbelief, confused, and even in denial," Shavonne Moore-Lobban, licensed psychologist, previously told USA TODAY. "The suddenness of the loss may be too much to process and feel too unreal for a person to immediately grasp."

Somers' longtime publicist, R. Couri Hay, shared a statement on behalf of the actress' family with the news Sunday. The actress, who "survived an aggressive form" of breast cancer for over 23 years, "passed away peacefully at home in the early morning hours" on Sunday," the statement read.
"Sudden loss can be more shocking and people can feel less 'prepared' than they might with expected loss," Moore-Lobban added. "However, it is still hard to prepare for anything that is life-altering, whether a person knew it was coming."

Many have parasocial relationships with those in the public eye, be it celebrities, politicians, news anchors. You feel close to them like they're your friend or relative.
Just because collective or public grief doesn't match how one might grieve someone close to them, that doesn't make the experience any less real.
"It's a fascinating thing that people don't realize we really can grieve people we didn't know," Kessler added. "And it doesn't mean we're going to grieve them like our spouse or mother, father, or sister or child, but we will grieve them."

If you're trying to comfort someone going through loss, don't try to minimize it or put a timetable to the grieving process.
"There is no limit to grief and because it is a cycle or process, it will continue as long as it needs to for the person who is experiencing it," Moore-Lobban said.
If you're going through loss yourself, talk about it. This "might mean acknowledging it and being open with someone you trust, about how you are feeling," Moore-Lobban said. "It might also include engaging in therapy with a mental health provider, which can be individual or group therapy. Talking about it can also occur by writing, meaning a person can journal about how they feel and what they are thinking."
The deaths of public figures may also serve as opportunities to widen discussions on grief.
"We have a relationship with death that we don't quite know how to explore as a society," Kessler said. "I always tell people the death rate is 100%. So we know we're all going to die someday, intellectually, but we don't know, is death the great enemy? Is it the great comforter, when we're in pain? We sort of don't know how to hold it."

Britney Spears is opening up in a new interview, her first in years, about her anticipated tell-all and becoming her own woman after being freed from her 13-year conservatorship.
The pop star's anticipated new memoir, "The Woman in Me," is set to debut on Oct. 24, and excerpts from the book were released on Tuesday via People.
In a shocking revelation, Spears, 41, claimed in her memoir that she became pregnant during her relationship with Justin Timberlake and had an abortion.
"Justin definitely wasn't happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren't ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young," she wrote, according to the outlet.
Spears and Timberlake dated from 1999 until 2002 in their early adult years.

In an accompanying new interview done via email with People, Spears discussed how she is handling her "new freedom" in the wake of the nearly 14-year-long conservatorship under her father, Jamie Spears, 71, which a Los Angeles County judge terminated in November 2021.
As her relationships have evolved with her family, including her dad, mom Lynne Spears, 68, and sister Jamie Lynn Spears, 32, and model and actor Sam Asghari, 29, with whom she split in August after 14 months of marriage, Spears told People life after the conservatorship has its difficulties.
"Learning this new freedom, I'll admit, is challenging at times," the "Gimme More" singer said.
But in releasing her memoir, she tells people she is "finally free" to tell her story.
"Over the past 15 years or even at the start of my career, I sat back while people spoke about me and told my story for me," she said. "It is finally time for me to raise my voice and speak out, and my fans deserve to hear it directly from me. No more conspiracy, no more lies — just me owning my past, present and future."
Spears has accused her father and others of exploitation and abuse under the conservatorship, detailing in the memoir how she was made to feel like "a sort of child-robot" and a "shadow" of herself.
"The conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child," the "Womanizer" singer writes in the excerpt of the memoir shared with People. "I became more of an entity than a person onstage. I had always felt music in my bones and my blood; they stole that from me."
Delving further into the past, Spears writes of her casting on the Mickey Mouse Club at 11 with Christina Aguilera and Ryan Gosling, including how the cast would "run choreography thirty times in a day" and how she kissed castmate Timberlake at a sleepover.
"At a sleepover, we played Truth or Dare, and someone dared Justin to kiss me," Spears writes. "A Janet Jackson song was playing in the background as he leaned in and kissed me."
Spears also details how her first movie role in the 2002 year drama-comedy film "Crossroads" caused her to inadvertently fall into method acting.
"I ended up walking differently, carrying myself differently, talking differently. I was someone else for months while I filmed 'Crossroads,'" the "Oops!…I Did It Again" singer writes.
Getting too deep into a character made her "glad" she didn't get the role of Allie Hamilton in "The Notebook" opposite Gosling, which ended up going to Rachel McAdams.
"That was pretty much the beginning and end of my acting career, and I was relieved," she continued. "'The Notebook' casting came down to me and Rachel McAdams, and even though it would have been fun to reconnect with Ryan Gosling after our time on the Mickey Mouse Club, I'm glad I didn't do it."

Spears also talked about growing up in Louisiana, her work ethic as a child star, getting a record deal at Jive Records at 15, and her infamous 2001 VMA performance of "I'm a Slave 4 U."
The "snake's tongue is flicking out at me. Right. Now," she writes. "Finally, I got to the part where I handed it back, thank God."
The excerpts also include her thoughts on becoming a tabloid fixture in the early 2000s, the harm it caused, the termination of her conservatorship, and how she hopes telling her story inspires others.
"Shaving my head and acting out were my ways of pushing back," Spears writes.
"The woman in me was pushed down for a long time. They wanted me to be wild onstage, the way they told me to be, and to be a robot the rest of the time," she said. "I felt like I was being deprived of those good secrets of life — those fundamental supposed sins of indulgence and adventure that make us human.
"It took a long time and a lot of work for me to feel ready to tell my story," she said. "I hope it inspires people on some level and can touch hearts."
"The Woman in Me" will be released on Oct. 24 by Gallery Books, a Simon & Schuster imprint.
Spears previously co-authored the 2000 autobiography "Britney Spears' Heart to Heart," and the 2001 young adult novel "A Mother's Gift" with her mother, Lynne Spears, both of which appeared on the USA TODAY Best-Selling books list.

Britney Spears memoirwill be released in October: 'The publishing event of the year'
LOS ANGELES – With her “Okie” accent and a smile almost always taking over her face, it can be easy to underestimate “The Voice” Season 24 rookie coachReba McEntire. But her fellow coaches – John Legend, Niall Horan and Gwen Stefani – should do so at their own risk.
During this season’s Battles (NBC, 8 EDT/PDT Mondays and Tuesdays), which begin Tuesday, the queen of country music, 68, will flex her coaching chops after duking it out with the other coaches to build their teams over seven Blind Auditions episodes. During a recent set visit to Battles rehearsals, it’s evident the newest coach’s contributions to the competition go beyond her “Reba-isms” and on-set tater tot cart.
Outfitted in knee-high cowboy boots, black pants and a black, gold and white sweater, McEntire is excited to connect with young up-and-coming artists and marvel at their talent. She’s also quick to empathize with them.
“I was nervous, also,” she tells one of the singers, who confesses to being anxious during the Blind Auditions.
After all, she’s still finding her legs on “The Voice” – just like they are. (Her fellow coaches have been been "very patient with me, which I'm very grateful for," she says, adding, "Everybody's getting along great.")
“My mentality at first in the Blind Auditions was to hit the button every time when I like somebody,” McEntire tells USA TODAY in an exclusive interview. “Kyra (Thompson) and Audrey (Morrissey), the producers, kept coming over. They said, 'You don't need to hit your button all the time. You've got to be selective.’”
McEntire was having none of it. “I said, 'I waited till four seconds (into the performance). I want this person! I'm going to get them.'”
"This bunch? So much fun":Reba chats about Blake Shelton, her coaching philosophy
After giving feedback to two of her Battles pairings, McEntire takes a break from taping to reflect on how she can put herself in the contestants’ shoes.
“It was hard, and it was lonely. I try not to bring that up because I do want to keep on the positive, happy side,” she says of trying to break into the music industry. “But there are so many nights you're calling home and everybody's in the kitchen cooking dinner, and you go lay back down in the bed there in the Holiday Inn and cry because you're not there and you're so homesick you can't hardly stand it. But you've got your dream and you're going forward.”
The hottest topic on set during rehearsals is how to deal with performance jitters.
“The one thing that each team asked is, 'What do you do about nerves?' That's a very honest, humbling question, because everybody does have nerves,” McEntire says. “I mean, I get nervous. But it's my job to show them a way to get around it.”
She may be a veteran in the industry who can boast of membership in the Country Music Hall of Fame, but McEntire still brings a sense of humility and excitement for making the most of her experience coaching on “The Voice.”
“I played basketball, I rodeoed, and I sang. And I'm not the best. I never will be the best,” she says. “I know that. I know my limits.”
That’s what encourages her to always challenge herself: “You always want to learn new things. That was what was so much fun sitting and listening to the other coaches, what they would say to the contestants,” she says. “It just made it very interesting to apply to my own career, because you're always looking for advice yourself.”
Monday's recap:'The Voice': Reba McEntire connects with Dylan Carter after emotional tribute to late mother
As the season progresses, McEntire reveals that underneath the Southern charm and tater-tot bribery is a killer instinct and a bluntness that she can employ at will.
Unfortunately for her fellow coaches, she's not afraid to use her power to block them from pitching the contestants she wants for her team. As Legend put it in an earlier episode, “Most of the time (McEntire is) a benevolent queen, but every once in a while she’ll do some ruthless, cold-blooded (and) dirty things.”
Sometimes, helping young artists hone their talent means giving them tough love. When two of her pop singers bring a slightly different version of a song than they’d rehearsed to the Battles stage, McEntire doesn’t hold back in letting them know that their choice to go off-script has consequences.
In rehearsals, two of her artists are given the daunting task of singing McEntire’s “The Heart Won’t Lie.” This marks one of the few times McEntire isn’t smiling. Knowing the 1993 single that she performed with Vince Gill all too well, her ear picks up the errors in the performance.
But she approaches the feedback with tact and class, asking the country vocalist and Nashville veteran pairing whether they changed the melody in one section on purpose. The Nashville singer admits they need to familiarize themselves with the song more and “tighten it up.”
Other than understandably being critical of a performance of one of her own songs, McEntire isn’t here to nitpick. She wants to help her artists reach new heights: “That's what I'm looking for, something that will surprise them and make them feel like, ‘Man, this was really worth doing,’” she says.
“The music and melody (are) technical things that I don't have. I'm not a perfectionist, so it doesn't really bother me if it's a little flat or sharp,” she says. “If your heart and soul is in it and I felt something, we've done our job.”

Millie Bobby Brown had an unexpected feminist awakening.
The "Stranger Things" star, 19, revealed in her Glamour UK "Women of the Year" cover story published Monday that she discovered she was a feminist after a psychic told her she was.
After the session, Brown recalled searching, "How do I know if I'm a feminist?" on Google and reading books and articles on the topic to understand "the idea of feminism and what it means to me."
"Ultimately (feminism is) about opportunity," she discovered in her quest for more knowledge on the topic.
Brown said she founded her production company PCMA with the aim of providing opportunities to girls and young women. Her upcoming film "Damsel" takes it to the next level: "The theme is feminism," she told the outlet.
Although the British actress didn't realize at an early age that she was a feminist, she had already been doing the work as UNICEF's youngest Goodwill Ambassador at age 14, promoting the need for menstrual products around the world.
Brown, who got engaged to Jon Bon Jovi's son Jake Bongiovi earlier this year, also dished on how her relationship helped her embrace herself.
"I think I was so afraid to be a strong woman in a relationship," she said. "When I met Jake, I just felt I could be loud. He embraced that and encouraged that. And I fell in love with myself while being with him."
The "Enola Holmes" star added that Bongiovi affirmed the positive qualities about her that she initially "hated about myself."
"Those are things that I love about myself now. He was a really big, huge part of me loving myself and becoming a woman," Brown said. "It was like, 'Wow, I really love this person because he allows me to love myself.'"
Millie Bobby Brown details romancewith fiancé Jake Bongiovi, special connection to engagement ring
The "Enola Holmes" actress hinted at her engagement to Bongiovi in an affectionate Instagram post in April.
In the photo, Bongiovi wrapped his arms around Brown at the beach. The "Stranger Things" star wore a beautiful ring on her engagement finger as she cuddled into her boyfriend.
"I've loved you three summers now, honey, I want 'em all," she captioned the post, referencing lyrics from Taylor Swift's 2019 hit "Lover."
The "Stranger Things" star and Bongiovi went Instagram official in November 2021 after sparking romance rumors in June 2021 when they were spotted holding hands through New York City. The couple later made their red carpet debut at the 2022 BAFTAs.

LSU will start the upcoming women’s basketball season where it ended the last one. The defending NCAA champion Tigers were voted No. 1 in the preseason USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll.
Picked first on 29 of 32 ballots, LSU will start the campaign as the preseason No. 1 for the first time in program history after winning the school's first national championship. The remaining three first-place nods went to perennial power Connecticut. The Huskies, who get back All-America guard Paige Bueckers after she missed all of last season, will begin at No. 2 overall as they begin their quest for the program’s 12th NCAA title.
Next comes Caitlin Clark-led Iowa at No. 3, also with its highest starting point in program history. South Carolina, which began each of the last three seasons at the top, will start this time at No. 4. Virginia Tech rounds out the top five, also with its highest preseason position.
TOP 25:Complete USA TODAY Sports women's basketball poll
OUTLOOKS:Previewing each team ranked in the preseason Top 25
Though all 32 Division I conferences are represented on the voting panel, the preseason Top 25 is the exclusive realm of the six power leagues. The fifth-ranked Hokies head a list of seven ranked ACC teams. The Big Ten and Pac-12 come next with five apiece. The SEC has four overall, followed by the Big 12 with three and the Big East with two.
Readers with quick math skills will notice that adds up to 26. That is because Miami (Fla.) and Michigan are in a tie for 25th. Curiously, the poll also features a tie at No. 23 between Creighton and Oklahoma.
College hoops is right around the corner and if you love women's basketball, you know that means that trash-talking queens Angel Reese of LSU and Caitlin Clark of Iowa are about to be back on your TV, chattering to everyone on the court.
The women's game continues to grow exponentially in popularity, evidenced by another March Madness of record TV ratings and the fact that Iowa just packed 55,464 fans into their football stadium for an exhibition game against DePaul.
We're not entirely sure what the 2023-24 season will hold, but we know it'll be star-studded with the return of Reese, Clark, Stanford's Cameron Brink and (finally!) Connecticut's Paige Bueckers.
Here are season outlooks for the 25 teams in the USA TODAY Sports preseason women's basketball poll:
Points: 797 (29 first-place votes). Last year's final ranking: 1.
The 2023 champs were already going to be loaded again, with the return of double-double ace Reese (23.0 ppg, 15.4 rpg) and superstar sophomore Flau’jae Johnson (11.0 ppg). Then they added Hailey Van Lith, an All-America guard at Louisville and the best overall player in the portal. The Tigers, under third-year coach Kim Mulkey, will be heavily favored to return to their second consecutive Final Four.
TIGERS ON TOP: LSU is No. 1 in preseason women's basketball poll for first time
Points: 727 (3 first-place votes). Last year's final ranking: 9.
Bueckers is healthy! Bueckers is healthy? If you’re a UConn fan, you oscillate between these. Provided the 6-foot guard is completely healed from a torn ACL suffered before the start of last season, the Huskies will again be contenders, especially when coupled with Azzi Fudd (15.1 ppg) to form what should be an elite backcourt. In UConn time, it’s been forever since the Huskies won a title (2016, to be exact). Can they fix that this year?
Points: 713. Last year's final ranking: 2.
Clark (27.8 ppg, 8.6 apg) is back. Is her shooting range even more impressive than last year, when she won every national player award and led Iowa to the Final Four? We’ll find out soon enough. The Hawkeyes are more than just Clark — Kate Martin and Gabbie Marshall will up their production this year — though they’ll badly miss the inside presence of Monika Czinano. 
Points: 671. Last year's final ranking: 3.
The Gamecocks' biggest strength last year was depth, which is why they’ll be a top team in 2023-24, too. Yes, they’ll miss Aliyah Boston. But life is good with 6-foot-7 Kamilla Cardoso (9.8 ppg, 8.5 rpg) and 5-foot-8 point guard Raven Johnson (3.4 apg) on the court, and South Carolina added Oregon transfer Te-Hina Paopao, a point guard who, when healthy, is a lethal shooter. 
Points: 617. Last year's final ranking: 4.
This might be too low a ranking for the Hokies, considering they went to the Final Four last season and return two-time ACC player of the year Elizabeth Kitley (18.2 ppg, 10.7 rpg) as well as point guard Georgia Amoore (16.3 ppg), who lit up the tournament during their run last year. No one is really talking about Virginia Tech as a national title contender, which means they likely feels disrespected and overlooked — which is usually when the Hokies thrive. 
Points: 598. Last year's final ranking: 6.
Cotie McMahon (15.1 ppg) was one of the top freshmen in the country last year, playing with a confidence and poise unusual for a first-year player. The Buckeyes have her back, and got one of the best defensive guards in the country when Celeste Taylor transferred from Duke. The addition of Taylor will make Ohio State’s press even more suffocating. 
Points: 565 Last year's final ranking: 8.
The Utes are looking to build off a record-breaking season in 2022-23 that ended in the Sweet 16, and will have all five starters back to help them do it, including 2023 Pac-12 player of the year Alissa Pili (20.7 ppg).  Utah’s offense is scary efficient, but the defense has to get better if the Utes want to make another deep run. 
Points: 555. Last year's final ranking: 13.
The Bruins got a huge boost when Charisma Osborne (15.9 ppg), one of the best in the country at stuffing the stat sheet, decided to come back for a super senior year. Then they got more good news when Lauren Betts, the top freshman in the 2022 class, chose to transfer from Stanford to UCLA. Add sophomores Kiki Rice and Gabriela Jaquez and the Bruins are loaded with talent and experience. 
Points: 534. Last year's final ranking: 7.
Mackenzie Holmes, the Hoosiers’ 6-foot-3 All-American who averaged 22.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game, is back and the perfect piece to build around. Yarden Garzon, a sophomore from Israel, is clutch from deep, connecting on 45.8% of her 3-point attempts as a freshman. The Hoosiers aren’t flashy, but they’re solid, especially defensively, and extremely tough to beat home. 
Points: 511. Last year's final ranking: 11.
Point guard Olivia Miles is one of the top playmakers in women’s basketball and as soon as she gets healthy from a knee injury, the Irish will be a nightmare in the open floor. While Miles rehabs, look for freshman point guard Hannah Hidalgo to make an immediate impact. Cass Prosper, one of the best newcomers in the country last season, is also ready for a big jump. 
Points: 451. Last year's final ranking: 5.
North Carolina State transfer Jakia Brown-Turner will be an instant contributor behind All-Big Ten guard Shyanne Sellers (13.9 pgg). The Terps love to play fast and score in bunches, and are always one of the toughest teams to slow down.
Points: 431. Last year's final ranking: 20.
Rickea Jackson, one of the best scorers in the SEC, is back, and Tamari Key rejoins the party after missing 2022-23 with medical issues. Together, they give the Lady Vols a formidable one-two punch. 
Points: 427. Last year's final ranking: 10.
The Cardinal lost a fair amount to graduation and the transfer portal, but will rebuild behind Cameron Brink (15.1 ppg, 9.6 rpg), the shot-blocking sensation who is the best defensive player in women’s college hoops. 
Points: 357. Last year's final ranking: 19.
Do-everything guard Rori Harmon (11.2 ppg, 7.4 apg) is one year older and wiser, and again has DeYona Gaston (12.7 ppg) and Taylor Jones inside to help. The Longhorns’ defense keeps them in every game. 
Points: 309. Last year's final ranking: 14.
The Cardinals lost Van Lith but brought in another terrific scoring guard in Jayda Curry from California. Three other big portal pick-ups, plus improved play from Olivia Cochran, will put Louisville in a position to contend for the ACC title. 
Points: 304. Last year's final ranking: 22.
No one loves working the portal like Rebels coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin, better known as “Coach Yo,” and she got Kennedy Todd-Williams, one of North Carolina’s top players, off the transfer portal this spring. Add returners and a couple of other top-notch transfers, and things should keep rolling in Oxford. 
Points: 278, Last year's final ranking: 21.
Few players in college hoops stuff a stat sheet like Deja Kelly (16.5 ppg), who returns to Chapel Hill along with fellow first-team All-ACC guard/forward Alyssa Ustby (13.2 ppg, 8.3 rpg). 
Points: 212. Last year's final ranking: 18.
Led by Quay Miller (13.1 ppg, 8.9 rpg), the Buffaloes return their top four scorers from last season and are looking to build on the program’s first Sweet 16 appearance in 20 years. Jaylyn Sherrod (11.3 ppg) is a fun, feisty guard who oozes competitiveness and her ability to turn the corner causes problems for defenders.
Points: 152. Last year's final ranking: 16.
The Blue Devils lost two starters to the transfer portal and one to graduation, which means more will be expected of returners Reigan Richardson and Kennedy Brown. Graduate transfer Camilla Emsbo, a first-team All-Ivy League selection two years ago at Yale, should help Duke again be one of the top defensive teams in the country. 
Points: 151. Last year's final ranking: Not ranked.
The Bears return leading scorer Sarah Andrews (14.7 ppg), conference freshman of the year Darianna Littlepage-Buggs (10.6 ppg, 9.2 rpg) and add Kentucky transfer Jada Walker. 
Points: 138. Last year's final ranking: Not ranked.
Rayah Marshall (12.7 ppg, 11.5 rpg) is one of the most athletic bigs in the country, and her ability to score, rebound and defend should help USC make another tournament — and this time, a run. National high school player of the year Juju Watkins will make an immediate impact.
Points: 128. Last year's final ranking: Not ranked.
Ta’Niya Latson, the national freshman of the year who led the ACC in scoring (21.3 ppg), is back and looking to lead the Seminoles to their 11th consecutive NCAA women's tournament. 
Points: 95. Last year's final ranking: 17.
The Sooners shared the regular season Big 12 title last year with Texas, but senior forward Skylar Vann would like a banner all to herself this season. Vann, who averaged 11.5 point and 6.8 rebounds off the bench last season, is the only player to win the conference's sixth player award in consecutive seasons.
Points: 95. Last year's final ranking: Not ranked.
The Blue Jays run one of the best, most efficient offenses in the country, and when they’re hot, everyone is hitting from three and scoring layups at will. Three double-digit scorers return from last season, led by Lauren Jensen (16.1 ppg).
Points: 75. Last year's final ranking: 18.
The Hurricanes were one of the surprises of the last year's tournament, stunning top-seeded Indiana on the Hoosiers’ home floor to reach the program’s first-ever Elite Eight. Miami lost its top two scorers but added former Duke standout Shayeann Day-Wilson via the transfer portal. 
Points: 75. Last year's final ranking: 23.
Laila Phelia was one of the breakout players of the Big Ten last season, averaging 16.7 points and 4.2 rebounds. She’ll lead a talented roster featuring three graduate transfers, all of whom have topped the 1,000-point mark already in their careers.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The importance of Monday night’s game between the Dallas Cowboys and Los Angeles Chargers was palpable.
The Cowboys were embarrassed by the San Francisco 49ers in Week 5, while the Chargers, coming off a bye week, were attempting to get above .500 for the first time this season with a matchup against the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7 looming.
The urgency was evident even before kickoff with a pregame skirmish breaking out along the visiting sideline. Fists were thrown and there was plenty of shoving.
In the end it was the Cowboys who escaped with a gritty 20-17 victory by surviving a wild fourth quarter that included a touchdown by each team, a muffed punt by Dallas, a tiebreaking field goal by kicker Brandon Aubrey and a game-sealing interception by cornerback Stephen Gilmore.
"It was huge for us to get to 4-2, no doubt about it," said Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, who had just come off his most lopsided defeat as a Cowboys starter in Week 5. "We are moving forward and running our race, honestly. You got to show it week in and week out in this league. Look back this past weekend and obviously that shows you that."
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
The word "resilient" was uttered multiple times in the postgame visiting locker room as the Cowboys bounced back from being humiliated just eight days ago in the same state. The Cowboys now head into their bye week 4-2 and with a positive psyche.
"It was very crucial. Making sure we came out with the focus and intensity that we had all week," Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence said. "Also, leading into the bye you don’t want to have a sour taste in your mouth going into the bye. We came out here and got our jobs done but we have a lot to learn and get better from."
Monday’s win should give the Cowboys a renewed jolt of optimism aided by the stunning Week 6 defeats by the 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles, two teams Dallas is measured up to and will likely have to go through in its quest for NFC supremacy.
"It’s a good weekend," Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy said with a smile when asked about the surprising losses by the 49ers and Eagles. "Crazy weekend in the NFL, but we were on the right side of this week."
It was a good bounce-back week for the Cowboys. The franchise hasn’t lost back-to-back regular-season games since Week 11 and 12 of the 2021 season, they avoided going 0-2 in California and can now reset heading into the bye just one game behind the Eagles, 49ers and Detroit Lions for the best record in the conference with plenty of football left to play.
"It was a must-win. It was early in the season, but 4-2 and 3-3, it's a huge difference," Prescott said. "Going into the bye week, we talked about, after last week, not allowing this thing to landslide. Obviously, I think a win like this allows you to really close that book.
"When you get this win like we did, you definitely can move on. Now, we'll move forward from this one."

PHILADELPHIA — Philadelphia Phillies reliever Matt Strahm had just cracked open a can of Red Bull on Monday night, looked up from the bullpen, and on the first pitch of the game, there was a home run sailing over his head.
Four pitches later, there was another one flying deep into the night, traveling 420 feet, clearing the bullpen and clanking off the right-field seats.
Five pitches. Two home runs by Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper. Instant bedlam.
"I don’t think I’ve heard this place any louder," said Strahm, who confirmed with team officials that the noise level reached an ear-piercing 111 decibels. "I was talking to Hoffy (reliever Jeff Hoffman), and I couldn’t even hear myself talking. This place is unbelievable.
"You can’t explain what it feels like."

Schwarber and Harper instantly turned Citizens Bank Park into a house party, hitting two home runs in the first inning of a postseason game for the first time in franchise history. And then Nick Castellanos added another one in the second inning.
The home run barrage, and ace Zack Wheeler’s dominant performance, provided the Phillies a powerful 5-3 victory in Game 1 over the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League Championship Series, the D-backs’ first loss of the postseason.
"That gave us the momentum," said Castellanos, who has homered five times in his last three postseason games, tying Hall of Fame slugger Reggie Jackson’s record. "That unlocked the stadium. It unlocked the atmosphere. It just kind of put the night in our favor."
Uh, yes, to say the least.
The power show gave the Phillies 16 home runs this postseason, out-homering the opposition by 12 in their seven games. Their 12 homers alone in the past three games are the most by any team in a three-game span in postseason history. Since the last postseason, the Phillies have out-homered their opponents, 32-9, at Citizens Bank Park.
"I am amazed," Castellanos says. 'Not surprised."
The difference?
"When you’re watching something amazing like all of these home runs we’re hitting," he said, "you can appreciate it. But I’m not surprised because I know we’re capable of doing it."
The Diamondbacks, who didn’t trail for a single pitch in their three-game sweep against the Los Angeles Dodgers, watched in horror as Zac Gallen gave up three home runs to the first seven batters he faced after yielding only three homers in his last eight starts.
"They just ambushed us," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. "They came out ready to jump on his fastball."
If the three home runs traveling 1,202 feet weren’t impressive enough, the Phillies provided a little theater, too, courtesy of Harper, who celebrated his 31st birthday with 45,396 of his closest friends at Citizens Bank Park.
Harper, who like Schwarber swung on the first pitch, danced around the bases when his ball sailed into the right-field seats, crossed home plate, flashed three fingers on his left hand and one on his right, and blew them out like they were candles.
"It's crazy, sometimes I just do stuff, and that felt right," Harper said. "So I thought I would step on home plate and do that."
The Phillies players watched in awe, with some like shortstop Trea Turner thinking he was putting up four fingers to illustrate that he’s hit four homers this postseason, until later discovering the truth.
"I mean, everyone went nuts," said Schwarber, whose first-pitch homer, 117-mph off his bat, was a postseason record fourth leadoff homer. "This guy, he is looking for the moment, and he wants it. He’s doing such an unbelievable job for us.
"When he is going up to the plate, you are just thinking that he is going to do something special every time.
"Can that be unfair to have an expectation on a player? Sure. But that’s what everyone is thinking when you’re in the dugout, 'Man, what’s this guy going to do next?'"

Well, the truth is that the Phillies are now starting to have the same expectations of Castellanos, who has five home runs this postseason from the No. 7 spot in the batting order.
"Nick definitely brings some swag to the game," Phillies outfielder Brandon Marsh said. "He’s having fun out there, just playing a kid’s game.
"I got the best seat in the house on deck watching him. It’s truly special, seeing a guy, with the pitching caliber we’re going up against, and taking care of business.
"He’s just an unbelievable talent."
So, if Reggie Jackson is Mr. October, just what are we supposed to call Castellanos?
"I don’t know," Strahm says. "Nick is Nick. There’s only one of them. I think your best bet is probably to hold four fingers up against him right now.
"I mean, if you tried to pitch around him, he’d probably hit that too."
The Phillies, who celebrated their victory with a strobe light and fog machine, know that one game hardly makes a series. They still need to defeat the D-backs three more times to reach the World Series for the second consecutive year. But they’re starting to feel invincible at home, winning a record 10 consecutive postseason games at Citizens Bank Park against National League teams, and are 27-11 overall at their ballpark in October.
Harper reminded everyone before and after the game that no one is going to take the D-backs lightly, praising them for their scrappy play. Once the team briefly celebrated their win, Harper was quite mellow, sitting alone in front of his locker and looking at his cell phone. He finally got up, showered, and met the media.
"I’m just very thankful to play this game," said Harper, who also drove in a run in the third inning, and is hitting .409 with a .567 on-base percentage and .955 slugging percentage this postseason. "I'm very thankful to be able to be in that spot in that situation. It's fun. I mean, it's a lot of fun.
"I’m pumped man."
Harper walked out of the clubhouse at 11:26 p.m. local time to see his family, but long after he departed, his teammates still couldn’t stop talking about him.
One day, they'll tell all of their friends and family, that they played with a player who could go down as one of the greatest clutch performers in the history of the sport.
The bigger the stage, the brighter the lights, there is Harper.
This is a guy whose career 1.044 OPS in the postseason ranks third among all players with at least 150 plate appearances, trailing only Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.
"It's really cool to see a player like that really exceed in these stages," saidSchwarber, "and show everyone what he's all about."
Once again.
A Royal Caribbean International cruise ship helped evacuate U.S. nationals from Israel on Monday.
The line’s Rhapsody of the Seas vessel had been sailing in the region but canceled its itineraries in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.
“Now, with enhanced safety precautions in place, our ship is providing free passage, including accommodation and food, for Americans in the region wishing to leave and find safer ground,” Jason Liberty, president and CEO of the line’s parent company Royal Caribbean Group, said in an email to employees that was shared with USA TODAY.
The evacuation was conducted in partnership with the U.S. State Department, Liberty said. The U.S. Embassy in Israel said in a security alert Sunday that boarding would begin in order of arrival on Monday at 8:00 a.m. local time, and the ship would sail from Haifa to Limassol, Cyprus.
The Rhapsody of the Seas ship can accommodate more than 2,400 passengers, according to Royal Caribbean’s website.
“Each traveler must be a U.S. national or the immediate family member (spouse/partner, children under age 21) of a U.S. national and have a valid passport,” the alert said. The embassy said travelers would be responsible for arranging their own accommodations and travel from Cyprus, but that chartered flights were also being arranged.
“This has truly been an incredible effort as our teams worked tirelessly over the past week to make this mission possible,” Liberty added in the email. “My heartfelt gratitude goes out to all involved and especially to the ship’s officers and crew for their unwavering support of this call to serve others in the midst of unimaginable tragedy.”
Escaping from Israel:U.S. families take tumultuous flights home after Hamas attacks
Many cruise lines changed itineraries following the conflict, in some cases suspending stops in Israel altogether. The State Department has an advisory in place for the region, warning against travel to Gaza and urging travelers to reconsider going to Israel and the West Bank.

A Florida-bound airplane had to turn around after receiving reports of a possible bomb on board, but airport officials found an adult diaper instead.
The Copa Airlines flight was headed to Tampa, Florida from Panama City’s Tocumen International Airport Friday when it received word of a suspicious object in one of the plane's bathrooms, the Associated Press reported.
The plane landed back in Panama and went to a solitary tarmac before evacuating 144 passengers and having an anti-explosives team inspect the aircraft, according to AP.
Head of airport security José Castro said that the suspicious object was not in fact a dangerous explosive, but an adult diaper.
“We had it on a secure runway where police special explosives canine units and special forces examined the object, and found it to be an adult diaper, ruling out any risk,” Castro said, according to AP.

Southwest Airlines wants to make it easier for you to get status in its Rapid Rewards program.
Beginning Jan. 1, it’s lowering the threshold to qualify for A-List and A-List preferred status.
According to the airline, the new requirements will be 20 qualifying one-way flights for A-List status, down from 25, and 40 qualifying one-way flights for A-List Preferred status, down from 50. The thresholds to earn those statuses through tier qualifying points (TQPs) will remain at 35,000 and 70,000 respectively.
Jonathan Clarkson, Southwest’s vice president of marketing, acknowledged that these changes are going against the grain of other updates in the airline rewards realm.
“While I’d love to say that we’re so nimble we did an immediate response, it just isn’t the case. We’ve been working on this for a while,” he told USA TODAY, referencing Delta Air Lines’ recent changes. “At a time when other programs, plural, are making it harder to achieve tier status, we’re making it easier.” 
Southwest is also lowering the spend-to-earn threshold on its co-branded credit cards. Rapid Rewards Premier, Priority, Premier Business, or Performance Business cardholders will now receive 1,500 TQPs for every $5,000 in spending, down from the current $10,000.
Other frequent flyer programs have seen a swelling of their elite ranks in recent years, diluting the benefits for some loyal travelers, but Clarkson said he’s not concerned about a similar scenario unfolding at Southwest.
“That was one of the criteria we used when we talked about how we arrived at these benefits. Foremost was ensuring that whatever changes we make didn’t result in bloating the program,” he said. “It will result in a larger program we anticipate, but not to the point where it erodes the benefit of the people who get to take advantage of it.”
Cruising Altitude:Don't bother with an airline loyalty program if you're this traveler
The airline announced other changes to Rapid Rewards benefits as well, including the option to book tickets using a combination of cash and points. Previously, Southwest tickets had to be purchased using all cash or exclusively points.
Clarkson said A-List Preferred members will also be entitled to up to two free alcoholic drinks per flight. He added that vouchers for those drinks will be embedded in the passenger’s boarding pass scanner code, rather than travelers needing to present physical certificates onboard.
Customer feedback has been positive about the changes so far, according to Clarkson. He said the changes were workshopped with frequent flyers before they were announced.
“This is another example of Southwest deciding to zig when everybody else zags,” he said. “We have a program we want people to use and get the benefit of.” 
JetBlue, Frontier Airlines and Alaska Airlines all moved to capitalize on Delta’s unpopular changes to their loyalty program by enticing flyers with generous matching programs.

UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay.
Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports.
Their partnership should have been a force for good. Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.
The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.
Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.
But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.
According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.
“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”
In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”
“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”
Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.
The stakes are high for everyone.
Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.
Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.
Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.
Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.
“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”
USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.
Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.
For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.
Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.
For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.
“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”
Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.
Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.
At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.
By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.
Tucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.
Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline
Tucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.
Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.
Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.
Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.
During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.
They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.
In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”
It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.
Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.
Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.
They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.
Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.
By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.
Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.
Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”
Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.
Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.
Twelve days later came the call.
Tracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.
According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.
“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”
Tracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”
She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.
“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”
Tracy said she thought to herself, "Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it." In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”
When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.
Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.
Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.
At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.
Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.
When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.
Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.
Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”
Tucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.
The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.
Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.
She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.
Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.
“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”
The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.
A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.
Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.
Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.
Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.
Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.
Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.
“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.
Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.
Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.
Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.
Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.
They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.
“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”
Michigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.
The case would go forward.
Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22.
He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.
For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.
Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.
An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.
Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.
During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”
Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.
“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”
Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.
Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.
Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.
Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.
At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.
Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.
Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”
Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.
One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.
A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”
“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”

On a sunny Thursday morning, Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker strolled through tomato fields at a farm in Immokalee, Florida, toured its processing plants and loaded baskets of bright green fruit into a truck. 
It was a private event thrown by the school to promote its migrant student services program, which provides financial aid and support to farmworkers seeking college degrees. After the April 28, 2022, tour, disclosed in records obtained by USA TODAY this week, Tucker met with community leaders and alumni.
That night, Tucker would make the now-infamous phone call from his hotel room in nearby Naples, during which he is accused of masturbating and making unwanted sexual comments to Brenda Tracy, a prominent rape survivor and activist he had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence.
Yet, when Tucker met with the university’s outside investigator in March for his interview in the sexual harassment case against him, he insisted the trip was not work-related – a claim the investigator would disprove in her report.
It’s just one example of Tucker failing to keep his story straight at the most consequential moment of his career. 
With his job, reputation and the roughly $80 million left on his contract at stake, Tucker repeatedly made false statements to the investigator and misled her about basic facts, such as his location during the phone call and the date it occurred, a USA TODAY review of more than 1,200 pages of case documents found. 
The investigator, Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, and the news organization both obtained documents and witness statements that discredit key aspects of Tucker’s version of events. 
Michigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sept. 10, hours after Tracy went public for the first time with her story in USA TODAY. On Monday, the school informed Tucker it plans to fire him for cause based on the conduct he had admitted to and the embarrassment he had caused the school. 
Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivor
Although Tucker denied sexually harassing Tracy, he acknowledged masturbating on the call, saying he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex.” Tracy said Tucker’s romantic interest in her was completely one-sided and that she had tried to set boundaries multiple times during their yearlong business partnership.
Per his contract, Tucker has until Tuesday to make a case for keeping his job. Regardless, a formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated school policies against sexual harassment and exploitation is expected to proceed on Oct. 5 and 6. 
Since his suspension, Tucker has issued multiple public statements defending himself, attacking Tracy and accusing Veidlinger of bias. He accused the school of conducting a “sham” hearing and having “ulterior motives.” Yet even in these written statements, the central details of his story changed entirely.
Tucker, who previously hung up on a reporter who called him on his cellphone asking about the case, did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. His attorney, Jennifer Belveal, has not responded to phone calls and emails. Tracy declined to comment for this story.
In the absence of eyewitnesses or recordings, sexual harassment cases usually boil down to whose account is more credible, said Elizabeth Abdnour, a Lansing-based attorney and former Michigan State Title IX investigator who has taken part in dozens of campus cases.
“It’s very, very unusual that you would have some outside piece of evidence that would give you a clear decision,” Abdnour said. “Very often you’re weighing credibility based on little bits and pieces of information.” 
In multiple cases she has worked, Abdnour said the respondents lost because they were found to have a greater propensity for lying than the complainants. The hearing officer must determine how much weight to give Tucker’s false and conflicting statements, Abdnour said, and they could sway the case in Tracy’s favor.
“I believe a fact finder could assess these pieces of evidence about credibility and make a determination that Brenda is more credible than Mel,” she said. “In my experience, a clear sign of a lack of credibility is generally taken very seriously.”
By the time Tucker met with Veidlinger for his interview, he had had months to prepare.
The school had informed him of Tracy’s complaint on Dec. 22, the day after she filed it. Veidlinger had interviewed Tracy and all six of her witnesses by the end of January. Tucker was the only holdout.
Rather than tell his side of the story right away, Tucker and his attorney spent three months trying to stop the investigation, case documents show. They wrote legal arguments urging Michigan State to drop the case and twice approached Tracy’s attorney proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no, and the school pressed forward.
On March 22, the day of his interview, Tucker sent Veidlinger a seven-page written account of his interactions with Tracy and lists of their “currently existing” text message and call history, which he said his legal team had compiled. Only a handful of text messages remained; he and Tracy both told the investigator they had deleted their texts with each other in the months after the April 2022 phone call.
In his interview, which lasted 3 ½ hours, Tucker questioned whether Tracy had mixed up the date of the call. He said he recalled being at his home in East Lansing when it occurred, but his own records showed that he had been in Florida on April 28, attending a charity function that was “absolutely not a University-sponsored event.”
His seven-page account told a different story – that he had called her while he was “alone in a hotel room.”
Veidlinger does not appear to have asked Tucker about the discrepancy, based on case documents. But by then she knew what he told her in the interview was untrue: she had already obtained records proving he had not been home in East Lansing.
An expense report he had submitted to the university for reimbursement of his hotel and meals shows Tucker flew to Naples, Florida, to attend a golf fundraiser hosted by The Greg H. Montgomery Jr. Foundation for Ultimate Growth, which raises awareness for suicide prevention. It showed he stayed at the Hilton from April 27 to 29, that the trip’s purpose was “administrative” and that it did not involve personal travel. He had flown there on a donor’s private plane.
The trip is when Tucker toured the farm in Immokalee to help promote Michigan State’s College Assistance Migrant Program. The event was titled “Working to make dreams a reality,” according to an agenda obtained from the university by USA TODAY through a public records request. The agenda features Tucker’s name prominently. Tucker posted photos from the tour on his Twitter account.
That Tucker was on a university-sponsored work trip during the incident was a contributing factor in the university’s determination that it had jurisdiction to investigate, the investigation report shows. 
Tucker’s lists of calls and text messages also were missing an important detail: They did not show any communication with Tracy on April 28. He acknowledged in the interview, however, that he had not reviewed the lists before submitting them and that they may have been incomplete.
Tracy, meanwhile, had already provided Veidlinger with her official cellphone records from Sprint that confirmed the date of their call: April 28.
Tucker and Tracy did not speak in the three months after the April 28 call.
Meanwhile, their assistants were planning Tracy’s third visit to campus – an in-person training with coaches and players scheduled for July 25.
Tucker canceled that training three days before, the investigation report shows. When Tracy spoke to him by phone on Aug. 2 seeking to find out why, she would tell the investigator in her interview that Tucker insinuated he would harm her career if she spoke about his conduct. He never rescheduled her visit, and they never spoke again.
The cancellation became a key focus of the investigator – one of a series of alleged incidents that taken together would meet the definition of sexual harassment, which can include pressuring someone into engaging in sexual behavior for an employment benefit and threatening that rejecting such behavior will carry a negative consequence.
“Reported allegations that a University employee is engaging in misconduct within the vendor-vendee relationship for which they are the decision-maker, and/or impeding in such a services relationship based on a quid-pro-quo sexual harassment allegation, is within a University sponsored program or activity,” Veidlinger wrote in the report, so school policy covered it.
Tucker tried to distance himself from the cancellation in a public statement on Sept. 11, the day after Michigan State suspended him without pay.
“I never cancelled any presentation,” he wrote. “Given a personnel change and scheduling challenges as football season approached, we merely postponed it until January 2023. She chose to file her complaint instead of proceeding with the training.”
But that statement contradicts what he told the investigator. When Veidlinger asked in his March interview if he had a role in canceling Tracy’s visit, Tucker said, “Yes, absolutely I did,” the report shows, and that he did not recall any discussions about rescheduling Tracy for January. Such timing would not make sense, he added, because most of his new players would not yet be on campus. 
Tucker also told the investigator why he canceled the visit, blaming it on a scheduling conflict. He said he had recently hired a mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, who needed to implement his new program on short notice. There was limited time in fall camp, Tucker said, and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” the players. He said he decided to yield the time to Newman.
Veidlinger, however, would later obtain records showing Newman did not meet with the team on July 25, the day of Tracy’s planned visit. He had been meeting with them weekly since June 6, the records showed but held no meetings between July 15 and July 28.
One of Tucker’s assistants, who is a witness in the case, also told the investigator that Tucker asked him via text message to cancel it. He said he was never instructed to reschedule. 
In his interview, Tucker told Veidlinger that his relationship with Tracy frayed after the April 2022 phone call – not because of the incident, but because of information he learned after that caused him not to trust her.
According to Tucker, an associate of his had told him over the summer that Tracy’s assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, had been gossiping about Tucker’s marriage, telling others it was “on the rocks.” Tucker said he was “devastated” because he had confided in Tracy about his marital problems, and he believed she had discussed them with Alvarado.
Tucker confronted Tracy about the alleged gossiping during the Aug. 2 phone call, they both told the investigator. Tracy said he berated and bullied her, repeatedly saying he could not trust her. She said she told him she did not know what he was talking about.
Alvarado – who was killed in a car crash in June – would deny discussing Tucker’s marriage with anyone in her January interview with Veidlinger. 
During the Aug. 2 call, Tracy said she pressed Tucker to identify his source – the associate. She told Veidlinger she believed Tucker had made it up as a pretext for canceling her visit and ending her relationship with the school.
Veidlinger also asked Tucker to reveal the source of his claim, but he refused to say. In her report, she wrote that he said he had “given (his) word that (he) wouldn’t divulge their name.” 
Tucker never revealed the associate’s name to the investigator, nor did he identify anyone who could support his version of events. In his Sept. 11 public statement, however, he lamented that the hearing would not afford him the opportunity to “offer any substantive evidence of innocence.”
It was not the only claim he attributed to his anonymous associate. In his interview, he said that same person told him that ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating how Tracy “goes about her business” by claiming to be a rape survivor.  
Tucker said this further caused him to believe Tracy was untrustworthy because she believed Lavigne was her friend but didn’t know she was investigating the rape story at the center of her public persona. 
It turned out to be yet another falsehood.
Reached by USA TODAY, Lavigne said in an emailed statement that she was “perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.” She said Tracy has been a source of information for her for several years, and that she has featured Tracy’s comments and advocacy work in multiple news stories.
“That has been the extent of my reporting on Tracy and her organization,” Lavigne wrote. “Neither the organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting.”
Asked who might have told Tucker this misinformation, Lavigne responded, “I have absolutely no idea who would have alleged this to anyone.”

The bullets came in plywood crates. 
Any given box was about the size of a small microwave oven. The printed label stuck to each one demonstrated a militaristic brevity. “CARTRIDGES FOR WEAPONS, INERT PROJECTILE,” next to a bright yellow hazmat sticker, “EXPLOSIVES.” 
Inside the boxes: drab green steel cans of .50-caliber ammunition. Each round was giant, more than 5 inches long, built to be fired from a gun so big it is typically bolted to a truck. The bullets were clipped together in long strands for rapid, machine-gun fire. 
By the time Bill Brown got to the boxes, they sat double-stacked eight high atop wooden pallets inside a Missouri warehouse. The pallets went on, row after row. Three million bullets in all. 
It was enough ammunition to feed a single machine gun – if fired nonstop at its rated speed eight hours a day, seven days a week – for almost six months. 
Brown’s job was to get it out of there and toward the Ukrainian front lines. The faster, the better. 
“War is bad,” Brown said. “Loss of life is bad. But at the end of the day, it’s very profitable and injects revenue into this military industrial base.”
There would be virtually no public record of this Ukrainian arms shipment. As a weapons dealer, Brown’s company would deliver the bullets under a system known as a direct commercial sale. The ammunition required a State Department signoff – but the secret deal would never appear in a White House announcement or the Congressional Record. 
Instead, it was part of a shadowy system of brokers, exporters, arms dealers and country-to-country transfers that has become one part of the race to meet demand on distant battlefields. 
Western weaponry fueled Ukraine’s summertime counteroffensive along a 600-mile front. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the effort was delayed in part by the wait for more arms. Amid concerns about that slowly progessing counteroffensive, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday with a promise of up to $175 million more in military equipment. 
Most of America’s $44 billion in documented support to Ukraine came in the form of old U.S. military stock, donated directly by the federal government. In general, commercial sales over $14 million, and sales of military-grade weaponry like mortars or missiles, require State Department approval and congressional notification.
But other aid comes via private sales. 
More than 14,000 U.S. entities are registered to conduct defense trade activities. Their deals are monitored by an alphabet soup of agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Trade secrecy clauses in federal law mean this flow of gear, weapons and ammunition is almost never revealed to the public.
Brown, who works for a small Nevada-based logistics company called Battle Born Munitions, provided USA TODAY with a rare look behind the curtain of these private sales. Details about the shipment were verified by his employer and the European government that made the purchase. State Department officials declined to answer questions about the specific shipment Brown described.
This March sale and the secret number of other shipments like it fuel Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion. Those sales also release an unknown amount of weaponry into the world. What becomes of that weaponry after it’s sold – and especially after it’s delivered – is difficult to track. 
As Brown surveyed the warehouse in Missouri, a crew steered forklifts and skid lifts among the stacks of plain wooden boxes. From high in the trusses, suspended lamp fixtures bathed the boxes in artificial daylight. Brown lifted his camera and started snapping photos. 
In just a few hours, he and his cargo would be boarding a jumbo jet. Three million bullets would climb to the stratosphere and hurtle across the north Atlantic toward a European dawn.
From Ukraine:War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented. So is the country's push for swift justice.
The bullets had once been bound for Saudi Arabia. 
Lot number SMQ19K401L026 had rolled off the assembly line in 2019 at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Kansas City. Lake City, owned by the government and run by a contractor, sprawls across nearly 4,000 acres of green Missouri farmland. Roads curve past World War II-era bunkers known as igloos, spaced out amid the countryside – far enough apart that an explosion in one won’t trigger a chain reaction in the others.
Lake City has been pumping out ammunition almost without pause since 1941. It is the largest small-arms manufacturing plant in the world.
Today the plant is run by Olin-Winchester, but in 2019, the bullets were made by some of the 1,700 workers employed by Northrop Grumman. And in 2019, Saudi Arabia was stocking up on weapons during the Trump administration, fueling the war in Yemen and other conflicts that drew criticism from congressional Democrats.
The plant manufactures .50-caliber ammunition on a rolling basis, for both military and commercial buyers. That’s a testament to just what a legend the bullet – and the gun that shoots it – has become.
In 2019, the technology was already a century old. The .50 caliber was the brainchild of American gunsmith John Browning during World War I. Built to respond to German anti-tank rifles, the M2 was first tested in 1918, and it entered widespread service in 1923. It earned the nickname “Ma Deuce” and has served in combat ever since, bolted to trucks, ships, planes and handheld stands on the battlefield.
The .50-caliber rounds – named for their diameter, about half an inch – can easily hit targets more than a mile away. At closer ranges, they will blast through solid concrete or armored vehicles. The gun can fire at a sustained rate of about 40 shots per minute.
Military setups use strings of “linked” ammunition to feed into machine guns. Spaced out after every fourth bullet, so-called tracer rounds have small pyrotechnic charges that illuminate the line of fire, aiding in targeting.
The gun’s longevity and versatility made it popular for militaries the world over. But this particular batch of bullets wouldn’t end up being sold to Saudi Arabia. 
The Biden administration put a temporary freeze on sales to the Saudi government in 2021 as it reviewed weapons deals approved under Donald Trump. Instead, Brown said, the bullets were sold to a U.S. ammunition provider, only to be held up again. Ultimately, they were mothballed. 
Then, in spring 2023, the bullets found a buyer, or actually two: first Battle Born; ultimately, the Netherlands. 
The European country, a NATO ally, needed a big supply of ammunition. It wouldn’t be keeping the bullets but giving them to Ukraine. Its purchase, essentially a donation, would count toward the country’s required NATO contribution. 
Brown had a line on exactly what they needed. It was sitting in the warehouse in Missouri. 
He arrived in March to personally oversee the shipment. As he prepped for delivery, Brown dropped tiny black tracking devices onto several of the pallets. Just $55 apiece, the units use GPS and cell signals to keep tabs on the load. The idea was to ensure it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands. 
But packing up the bullets was just the beginning. As with anything that’s deadly and made of metal, the shipping costs can be extreme. 
Brown said the question for the buyer was simple: “How fast do you want it? Forty-five to 60 days on a ship? Or in five days if I fly it?”
Brown – or Chief Bill, as he prefers – is a no-nonsense 35-year veteran of the U.S. Army and former helicopter pilot. He retired as a chief warrant officer and lives in Orlando. 
Now 59, he still spends a lot of time on the road – 10 international trips this year. He says his arms logistics work takes him to places most Americans would rather avoid – near the Syrian border or to unstable regions of Iraq.
He’ll travel halfway around the world, he quips, “have some soup, and go back to Warsaw to head home.” The trips aren’t really about the destinations. They’re about the cargo. 
On that spring day in Missouri, forklifts carefully loaded 107 pallets of the ammo onto 18 flatbed semitrailers. They’d all make the eight-hour drive to O’Hare International Airport. 
In Chicago, two Boeing 747-400s operated by National Airlines would be ready for the freight. 
Four pallets each were stacked and shrink-wrapped to create “air pallets” or “cookie sheets” weighing 12,800 pounds. Each plane could carry up to 17 of the pallets that ran the length of each plane secured by white cargo netting.
Flight records Brown provided show the two planes departed about seven hours apart, one in early afternoon, one after dark. 
The flight would take nine hours. Brown wasn’t going to the Netherlands, even though it was the buyer. The planes were bound for Rzeszów, Poland. 
The ancient city sits at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland. It has a gleaming modern airport next to a major east-west freeway. From there, it’s barely 60 miles to the border with Ukraine. 
It was an expensive journey. The trucking company’s bill for those 18 semis? $85,000. Chartering the two 747s? $625,000. Each.
But this shipment of .50-cal rounds was profitable for Battle Born Munitions, according to Brown.
The company purchased the 3 million rounds from Northrop Grumman at a bargain and resold them for more than double the price. (In subsequent interviews, representatives at BBM disputed the specific totals Brown mentioned, saying the accurate figures were protected by “various commercial and government non-disclosure agreements.” They did not dispute the other specifics of the deal he provided.) 
Retail prices for .50-caliber ammunition run roughly $5 per bullet. At that rate, the whole shipment would have been worth $15 million.
The pricing might also be elastic. The Dutch mark up the price of the bullets and count it toward their NATO contribution, pegged to a percentage of gross domestic product, Brown said. The Netherlands has contributed about $15 billion to NATO this year, or about 1.7% of its GDP and just under the NATO mandate of 2%.
Representatives of the Dutch military confirmed the shipment to USA TODAY but declined to comment further about the pricing or details.
The war in Ukraine has only increased the demand for private deals. The State Department signed off on more than $154 billion in commercial arms deals directly to foreign countries in 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year. 
Direct commercial sales represent a modest portion of the contribution to Ukraine compared with the $44 billion donated by the U.S., but they still amounted to more than $600 million in sales from U.S. companies to the Ukrainian government last year alone. That doesn’t include sales to other countries that also support Ukraine – sales like the one Brown described.
Jim Bartlett, an attorney with expertise in the specialized international arms transactions, said private U.S. businesses are playing a small but important role in the conflict.
“American companies are happy to export defense articles to foreign buyers approved by the U.S. State Department,” Bartlett said. “There’s an effort at the State Department to quickly clear the ones headed for Ukraine. … You get head-of-the-line privileges.”
Those sales also come with risks. 
Direct sales face fewer regulatory controls, oversight and enforcement, said Robert Nichols, an international military sales expert and attorney at the law firm Nichols Liu.
“You can imagine the range of characters involved in supplying a war effort,” Nichols said. “Some are highly credible. Others will skirt the law and sometimes step over the line by paying bribes, committing fraud and hiding their transactions.” 
So far, the Department of Justice has indicted just a handful of arms brokers over deals related to the war in Ukraine. Court records show the government has charged Miami-based Oleg Patsulya and Vasilii Besedin with illegally attempting to sell American-made aircraft parts to Russia. They allegedly lied to Commerce Department agents and told them the parts were bound for Turkey. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges this summer. 
A State Department spokesman declined to provide details of enforcement actions but said, “The United States takes seriously our responsibility to protect American military and dual-use technologies and prevent their diversion, including through strong enforcement actions.”
NATO said it oversees allied arms deliveries, and that those arms generally reach Ukraine. NATO itself technically only provides non-non-lethal aid, like fuel, medical supplies and generators.
Brown, of Battle Born, says he fields calls weekly from “clowns” without the proper licensing, whom he reports to the State Department for potential violations. Some raise red flags when they approach him about transactions that include payment via diamonds or gold.
He prefers traditional wire transfers with approved sales partners since he knows government officials are watching. He validates the contracts and checks certificates for the final users. That’s part of why he traveled with the ammunition. He would be meeting a Dutch military official for the official handoff.
“My job is to keep us all out of jail,” Brown said. 
The two 747s touched down in Poland, one before the sun, the other in late morning. Brown exchanged paperwork with a young Dutch military staffer who signed for the delivery, he said. They traded military patches as souvenirs. They snapped a photo together. 
The bullets bought by the Netherlands would never touch Dutch soil. 
U.S. aid:Billions from the US flows to Ukraine. Here's where it comes from, and how it adds up
Despite playing a small role proportionately in the war, $600 million in direct commercial sales can buy a lot of small weaponry. 
And those weapons are the kind most apt to fall into illicit use, said Elias Yousif, a research analyst at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit think tank.
Put another way: It’s hard to sneak away an F-16 or a missile launcher the size of a tractor-trailer. But a bunch of guns or a pallet of ammo? Much easier to resell. 
“In the commercial sector, especially in a new market, the risk increases,” Yousif said.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss arms research project, estimated that within a year, battlefield seizures and other forms of diversion led to 300,000 small arms and light weapons going missing, including 100,000 in Crimea alone.
When small arms go missing, they can go missing into another country, maybe one led by a despot or even a terrorist organization.
The U.S. government says diversion of American donations has been widely absent so far in Ukraine. That could be a combination of intensive “end-use-monitoring” programs and the reality of the battlefield, where supplies are rapidly put to use.
But even if not now, unused ammo could be resold someday. 
“History shows us this isn’t a short-term issue,” Yousif said.  “These are commodities with very long shelf lives.” 
Florida-based Global Ordnance, another State Department-licensed exporter, is a competitor in the direct weapons sales business. General counsel Bryan Van Brunt said the company has extensive protocols in place to track shipments and make sure the end-users are federally approved, though he declined to provide specifics about those systems. 
Brown, with Battle Born Munitions, says the company employs a mix of simple and sophisticated tracking technology to ensure his shipments are tracked to end users. The black GPS devices he dropped onto his cargo tracked the ammo all the way across the globe.
But that system only works as long as Brown is actually tracking. “Technically, my role ends when I deliver it to NATO,” he said.
Sometime after the 747s touched down in Poland, along with signing the paperwork and snapping a selfie with the Dutch official, Brown found the tiny black GPS trackers and lifted them off the pallets. 
Ukrainian trucks would arrive at the airport to pick up the ammunition. They would point toward the border, and onward to Lviv, and some distant battlefield. 
Brown would point in the opposite direction. Just like one of his quips: Fly in, have soup, get home. He headed toward Warsaw, with the GPS trackers in his bag.

The geography professor didn’t hide his clown fetish or the fact that he sometimes indulged his urges by recruiting students as subjects. He posted regularly about it on social media.
“I have a facepaint fetish and convince the cute girls in my classes to let me paint their faces,” he once wrote.
Yet Joseph Tokosh held jobs at two colleges and was on the tenure track at a third before student journalists at Nicholls State University in Louisiana exposed his behavior. He submitted his resignation the same day their story was published.
His interactions with students and open discussion of his fetish happened in both mainstream and tailored digital spaces. He popped into Facebook groups geared toward new students and niche forums on websites like Reddit. He posted videos on YouTube. In one Reddit post on a forum meant to highlight hard-to-believe stories, Tokosh posted pictures of several women in white face paint.
Over the years, two students reported him to campus police; others complained online. He left Kent State University after pleading no contest to something different: a theft charge that involved entering his peers’ offices without permission and taking a USB drive. Tokosh has not been charged with any other crime.
Tokosh’s career trajectory exposes inadequacies in the background check system that colleges and universities are supposed to have in place to protect students – especially when evidence of the concerning behavior resides largely on the internet. Nicholls State, for example, told USA TODAY Network reporters it does not routinely check social media for new hires.
A federal law intended to ensure the academic privacy of students also makes it difficult to determine how Tokosh was able to move so freely from campus to campus. Both Kent State and Northern Illinois University – where he taught while finishing his doctorate – noted Tokosh’s protected status as a graduate student in declining to answer questions.
Sophie Levan was a freshman at Kent State in 2017 when she encountered Tokosh, then 28, in a Facebook group intended as a gathering place for new students. Tokosh had offered cash to anyone willing to let him paint their faces. Levan, then 18, agreed.
The money was appealing but the interactions soured. 
Tokosh, she said, insisted he come pick her up and take her to the building that housed the geography department, where he would paint her face. Uneasy, Levan stopped responding. Tokosh got angry and wouldn’t give up, she said, which led her to file a police report.
“I felt like the school would want to know about it,” Levan said. “I thought maybe they could prevent anything bad from happening since other girls would go with him.”
She said there was never any followup from campus police – or anyone else.
USA TODAY Network reporters reviewed the experiences of six students who were the subject of Tokosh’s attention going back to his time at Kent State.
In addition to Levan, the other person who reported Tokosh to campus police could not be reached for comment. The two who expressed public concerns on social media told USA TODAY they never heard from their campus officials either.
USA TODAY attempted to reach Tokosh via phone, social media and a certified letter. A person answered a phone call to a number associated with Tokosh, but he hung up after the reporter identified himself. A reporter also reached someone who identified herself as Tokosh’s mother. She said she would pass along that reporters were trying to reach him.
Tokosh told the Nicholls student journalists that he did have an assignment where students were required to paint their faces as part of a cultural exercise. Prior to the article in the student newspaper The Nicholls Worth, the university had already cut Tokosh loose. He said his contract was not renewed because he was the target of a “grade inflation task force.”
The university, however, “does not have any such task force,” according to Nicholls spokesman Jerad David.
Tokosh also told students the face painting was a requirement in his cultural geography class to better understand other cultures. In a video interview with Hannah Robert, the station manager for the student-run KNSU TV, he says: “That's an assignment in one of my classes where they actually come up with their own face paint and makeup design inspired by a culture and they implement it.”
It’s a well-established trend in the academic world for professors to bounce from one institution to another without having to disclose why they left their last post, said Julie Libarkin, an associate dean at Michigan State University. She has seen the pattern often in her work maintaining a database of publicly documented sexual misconduct by faculty and staff.
As for grad students? Libarkin said people have requested she add them to her list, but universities’ conservative interpretations of the law get in the way.
“I don’t on purpose,” she said, “because that’s information that almost never comes out.”
Tokosh arrived at Kent State in 2015 with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in geography from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, according to his curriculum vitae. He was working toward his doctorate and researched fading businesses. His work about shopping malls in the Rust Belt won several awards. Like many graduate students, he also taught classes.
Then, Tokosh started showing up in the Facebook groups for new students. In a December 2017 post, an account under the name “Joe Tokosh” posted several pictures of women made up to look like clowns or skulls.
“If anyone is looking for some extra cash, I am looking for people to practice facepainting on!” he wrote. “I will literally pay you!”
Those are the types of posts that caught Levan’s eye. Not only was she pressed for cash, she was interested in movie makeup and thought the face painting could be fun based on the photos Tokosh had posted. But Levan said she soon realized that those images were stock photos and not representative of what Tokosh could do.
What’s more, she figured out that he was a graduate student, a fact she said he didn’t disclose in his posts.
When Tokosh offered to pick her up from her dorm, she refused. But, she said, Tokosh kept insisting she agreed to participate. Levan stopped responding to his messages and filed a police report with the Kent State police in January 2018. They advised her only to stop talking to Tokosh, she said, and let them know if “anything of consequence occurred.”
Months after she refused to meet up and filed the police report, Tokosh texted a picture of himself wearing white face paint to her cellphone. It arrived at midnight and contained no message, although writing on his shirt read: “I'm not a failure.”  
“There was some negative intention with sending that photo,” Levan said. “It’s definitely burned into my mind.”
What Levan didn’t know is that campus police had been put on notice a year earlier when another student filed a similar report. That student told police Tokosh reached out to her and her friends after they posted their numbers on a Facebook group for undergraduates. He would send “get to know you” messages, the police report said, and then ask the student if she was “interested in having her face painted for one of his class projects.”
When she found out Tokosh was a graduate student, she said no and eventually blocked him on Facebook and Snapchat, according to the report. Tokosh continued to text her.
“She does not have any concerns for her safety, but just wanted this documented,” the police report read. 
In July 2017, another student had retweeted a message from Kent State’s Twitter account that asked for Kent State love stories. She wrote: “A geography professor requested me on facebook and asked if he could paint my face like a clown.”
The student confirmed to USA TODAY that the professor was Tokosh and shared a screenshot of a Facebook friend request he sent her. She said she suspected Tokosh also found her on a freshman Facebook group because she posted there often.
She said she tweeted to draw officials’ attention to it and moved on but now wishes she had reported it officially.
College campuses are supposed to offer students special protections from sexual harassment even when it falls short of criminal behavior. Title IX, often associated with equity in women’s sports, also addresses “sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence” at schools that receive federal funding.
Colleges infrequently and unevenly enforce the rule, however. A 2022 USA TODAY investigation found just one of every 12,400 students was suspended in connection with sexual misconduct.
The student who shared her story online said the only response she received was from a graduate student in the geography department, who contacted her on Oct. 1, 2018. In an email, he wrote that he had seen her post and suspected he knew which faculty member had asked her about face painting.
“I brought it to the attention of some of our faculty because I was pretty sure I knew who it was, but they were certain it wasn’t that individual and that you probably just meant geology,” he wrote. 
He went on to reference another student being “approached in (at least by just looking at your tweet) a much more aggressive way.” The grad student asked the undergraduate for more information, but, she told USA TODAY, she didn’t respond. She said she started drafting a reply, but a year had passed. She wanted to move on.
Kent State would not say whether any actions were taken after the students’ reports, but Eric Mansfield, a spokesman for the university, said the police department confirmed that the students who filed police reports were provided with “university resources, which would include other non-criminal avenues to pursue (Counseling Services, Title IX, Center for Sexual and Relationship Violence Services, etc.) as a general police practice.”
Levan does not recall police offering her services, but she said she didn’t want counseling. She wanted Tokosh investigated.
Mansfield also said that the university monitors social media but that colleges “can’t always see or track every mention on social media.”
Police records show that officers did investigate when Tokosh was accused of breaking into geography department offices. A blotter item in the local newspaper shows police obtained an arrest warrant in connection with a third-degree felony burglary charge. Court documents indicate Tokosh pleaded no contest to a theft on Oct. 19, 2018.
Kent State would not explain what led to Tokosh’s departure during that fall semester. Instead, the university said that since Tokosh was a graduate student, any information about him was protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It also would not say whether school officials shared Tokosh’s disciplinary record with other colleges or even if it was standard practice to do so for grad students.
“Due to FERPA, student education records are private,” said Emily Vincent, a university spokeswoman. “Also, we do not comment on personnel matters.”
When Congress passed FERPA in 1974, its author, Sen. James L. Buckley of New York, said the intent was to protect the academic privacy of students and their families. In more recent years, Buckley has become critical of the law and how schools interpret it. He told the Columbus Dispatch in 2010 that “the law needs to be revamped.”
Survivors of sexual violence and students accuse universities of using the law to avoid negative media coverage. Students with a history of bad behavior may jump from one school to another without the public ever knowing about their histories. Law enforcement records don’t fall under FERPA’s purview, but a wide variety of questionable behavior does.
One case involved Brandon Austin, who was accused of sexual assault at Providence College in 2013 while on the school’s basketball team. But Providence College initially said Austin was suspended for violating the school’s code of student conduct and declined to share further details with the Providence Journal, citing federal privacy laws. Austin denied wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime. 
Austin was able to transfer to the University of Oregon, where he was again accused of sexual assault, along with other players. Police investigated the claims, and the local district attorney declined to press charges. The university expelled him anyway but raised FERPA when it declined to release records showing what Oregon knew about the allegations, according to the Oregonian.
LeRoy Rooker was the director of the U.S. Education Department office that oversaw FERPA for more than two decades. Rooker, now a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said FERPA is not a confidentiality law – it is focused on education records. And it doesn’t apply when a student is “seeking or intending to enroll” at another college.
Therefore, Rooker said, Kent State could have shared information about Tokosh with Northern Illinois.
Rooker also said FERPA would not have prevented Kent State from telling reporters if other universities had inquired about Tokosh, though they could not have disclosed what they shared.
He blamed the overuse of the law on fear of being sued.
“In this litigious age, institutions get a little wonky about whether they will forward, say, disciplinary records,” Rooker said. “On the other hand, if you have something and you don’t share it when you can and something happens at the next institution, I would say that’s a big liability.”
Backgrounding job applicants has become increasingly complex.
While most U.S. employers conduct background screening, according to trade group data, those inquiries typically focus on criminal history. Social media receives far less attention even though that is where people are most likely to share their unguarded thoughts.
Undertaking a full review of a person’s social media presence is more difficult than just checking an applicant’s Facebook page.
Does an applicant have an account on X, formerly Twitter? How about an account with Discord, an online platform frequented by gamers, where leaked Pentagon documents were recently shared? Or what about a Telegram account, a messaging platform popular among white nationalists? Further complicating things, it’s common on sites like Reddit for users to adopt usernames and describe experiences with little to no ties to reality.
A little digging, however, can turn up a lot of dirt.  
Tokosh has a LinkedIn page that includes his teaching stints at Northern Illinois University and Nicholls State University. His time as a student and instructor at Kent State is absent.
For LinkedIn, a custom URL includes a play on his name and his chosen field of study: Joeography. Tokosh would later use that moniker in promotional materials for a class at Nicholls State. That is the same handle used on Reddit by someone with a special interest in face paint.
One post features a video of Tokosh throwing a pie at someone. Other posts mention a “clown fetish.” In a forum titled “Creepy,” he wrote, “I convince pretty girls to let me paint their faces,” along with a photo with multiple women in white face paint.
That and other similar posts remained live for years until they were taken down after the Nicholls students published their story in late March.
USA TODAY Network reporters captured screenshots before they disappeared. With dates in 2019, the posts feature a young woman wearing a Kent State T-shirt. The material would have been available to administrators at Northern Illinois before the start of the fall 2019 semester.
Joe King, a spokesman for Northern Illinois, said departments hiring new graduate students are “not required to check social media or investigate a disciplinary history.” He added some departments may reach out to the graduate students’ former advisers.
King said he could not determine if the university was aware of Tokosh’s behavior at Kent State. He said that due to FERPA, he could not share specifics about Tokosh’s time at Northern Illinois, including whether students had complained about him.
But there are signs the behavior continued.
A YouTube account under the name “Joe Tokosh” included at least two videos in 2020 of a man throwing pies at women. One of the videos features a young woman also seen in the screenshots from Tokosh’s Reddit account. 
Comments on one from October 2020 read: “You can have a video of her tied up getting pied via cash app.” That video was viewed more than 30,000 times before it was turned off in late July, around the time a USA TODAY reporter reached out to Tokosh.
A former Northern Illinois State student shared text messages exchanged with Tokosh in which he asked to paint her face on multiple occasions. USA TODAY has agreed not to name her because she is concerned Tokosh might retaliate against her.
In the text messages, Tokosh shared a photo of a young woman in white face paint – an image also posted to the Joeography Reddit account. She said she declined to do it but was aware that other Northern Illinois students had participated.
By fall 2022, when he had moved on to Nicholls, Tokosh revealed to the student that he had required students in his cultural geography class to paint their faces.  
The Northern Illinois student asked Tokosh what he did with the photos, and she said he suggested that he might spin them off into a research project someday. She asked, had anyone complained? She said Tokosh responded: Why would they?
Many students would find a reason to complain, as Nicholls State student journalist Sally-Anne Torres learned firsthand. It started in January when one of her fellow reporters picked up an odd rumor: a professor was offering extra credit for students willing to paint their faces like clowns. Initially, Torres dismissed it because it seemed too unusual and there weren’t a lot of leads to follow. 
By Feb. 7, university administrators informed Tokosh that his contract would not be renewed, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY via a records request. They gave no reason for the nonrenewal, but on Feb. 12, Tokosh emailed his students that the university was letting him go. He blamed his departure on giving too many A’s.
That seemed suspicious to Torres. 
During her reporting, she received a tip about Tokosh’s Reddit posts in which he wrote of his “clown fetish” and how he enlisted his students to participate in it.
“It wasn’t just this innocent thing that a lot of these girls thought it was,” Torres said. “As a professor or teacher, that is somebody students are supposed to trust. He used his power to ruin that trust and to do these things, and that made me angry for them.”
Torres spoke to six students who shared their experiences with Tokosh. Some, she said, were followed on Twitter by him while others opted into an extra credit assignment he offered.
The women told Torres he sometimes giggled and laughed as they painted their faces in his office.
On March 27, the Nicholls Worth published a story headlined, “Geography professor suspended immediately, students allege sexual harassment.” KNSU TV, a student broadcast network, also aired footage in which Tokosh defended the assignment on camera. That same day, Tokosh submitted his resignation.
The story’s publication prompted other students to come forward about Tokosh and their frustration with the university.
Bradley Price took an online class with Tokosh and said the professor required students to photograph themselves with their faces painted. Price said Tokosh told them the assignment was to help them understand Japanese culture, but then Tokosh offered him bonus points if he could get a female friend to paint her face.
It seemed unusual at the time, Price said, because his friend wasn’t in the class. It became more concerning to him on reading the student newspaper’s report.
“I feel frankly disgusted and disappointed that Nicholls couldn’t do a proper background check on this professor, because this is unacceptable,” Price said. 
Bella Ramos, a junior at Nicholls State who did not take any of Tokosh’s classes, told USA TODAY that someone using the handle @Joeography21 followed her on Twitter in late 2021 and started liking all her selfies.
Ramos learned that the person behind the account was likely a professor at the university. She posted about the behavior in January 2022, but nothing came of it. She also found the Joeography Reddit account. On March 27, the same day the student newspaper published its piece, Ramos posted screenshots of her discoveries on Twitter with the message, “Found a Nicholls state university professor on Reddit.”
“I wish the university had acted sooner because all this information was public on the internet,” she told USA TODAY. 
No one from the university, she said, has ever reached out.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was able to transport hundreds of people from Israel to Florida just days after announcing an evacuation initiative by tapping into an existing rescue program, Project Dynamo, that likely would have gone forward with the effort regardless of the state’s support.
Florida has paid for five flights to evacuate people out of Israel between Friday and Sunday, including one that landed in Tampa Sunday night with 270 people, but Project Dynamo coordinated everything else, according to the group’s CEO and founder Bryan Stern.
Project Dynamo was founded in 2021 to help rescue people from Afghanistan after American troops withdrew from the country and has conducted missions everywhere from Ukraine to Sudan. The flight to Tampa Sunday was the group’s 602nd evacuation mission.
Stern spoke about the rescue missions during a news conference Monday and said he was raising money to pay for the Tampa flight when the state of Florida stepped in to offer assistance.
“We were fundraising right up until Gov. DeSantis and his office came in… bottom line is we would have figured it out,” Stern said. “We’ve done it six hundred and one times without government help, six hundred and two was not going to be the one that we failed on. But it makes it so much easier when you have backing by a state entity for sure.”
Many commercial flights out of Israel were canceled following a surprise attack by Hamas and subsequent retaliatory measures by Israel. That has left many Americans struggling to find a way out of Israel.
DeSantis declared a state of emergency last week and directed the Florida Division of Emergency Management to coordinate evacuation efforts. The governor, running what now appears to be a longshot campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, was at the Tampa airport Sunday to welcome the evacuees from Israel, which included 269 Americans – including roughly 70 Floridians – and one native of the Czech Republic.
Stern said he was grateful for Florida's financial support, the first time a government agency has funded one of his evacuation efforts, but also made it clear that he would've done everything to get people home safely, regardless of whether Florida funded the effort.
"Would it have been possible? I'll tell you that I wasn't going to leave them behind and I'm not trying to stay in Israel a moment longer than I need to so we would've figured it out, for sure," Stern said.
DeSantis' trip to Tampa on Sunday was “the first time an American politician has ever met us home,” Stern said.
The evacuation flight to Tampa involved gathering people from more than 12 different areas across Israel, Stern said. On the flight were Ron and Linda Neumann, who are trying to become dual citizens of Israel and the United States, and their dog.
The Neumanns have been living in Israel recently, but also live in Melbourne.
Ron Neumann said after two flights out of Israel were canceled he tried to find a way out of the country by contacting U.S. State Department officials and state officials in Florida. Neither effort was successful, but he heard about Project Dynamo through a friend and they helped him get on the flight to Tampa.
“It was a miracle from God because we had no way to get out," Neumann said.
Stern didn't know the exact cost of the most recent flight from Israel to Florida, but said the average cost to charter a plane from Tampa to Israel right now is around $2 million. The governor's office and the Florida Division of Emergency Management provided no answers to questions from the USA TODAY Network - Florida on costs of the trips.
The first Florida arrival of what supporters are calling "DeSantis Airlines" come at the same time the Biden administration is chartering flights from Israel to European destinations so passengers could book connecting flights home. DeSantis has slammed the White House for "dragging its feet" on the charters and said its flights "dump people in Europe."
“But people don't need to be dumped in Europe," DeSantis said in a video posted on the social media website X by his campaign. "They want to get home.”
The flights from Israel occurred the same weekend CBS News' 60 Minutes aired a segment Sunday critical of DeSantis' actions in September 2022, when his administration lured about 50 mostly Venezuelan asylum-seekers from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, off the Massachusetts' coast, with the false promise of jobs and housing.
Money for that trip came from a $12 million fund established within the state's Division of Emergency Management for relocating undocumented migrants from within Florida to other locations. The program has since been expanded and rewritten by the Florida Legislature to authorize DeSantis' action, after its legality was challenged in a handful of lawsuits.
DeSantis while campaigning in Iowa, home of the first Republican presidential nomination contest, has cited the Martha's Vineyard trip as proof of his commitment to combating illegal immigration and to underscore the failures of the Biden administration. DeSantis' White House bid probably lives or dies based on how he performs in Iowa.
Those evacuated from Israel by the state-financed effort focused their praise on Project Dynamo, touting the team's skills and efficiency.
"I'm humbled," said Linda Neumann. "To think that people risked their lives to come get us and our fellow Jews out of a war zone. I thank God for getting us out."

Taylor Wilson:
Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson, and this is 5 Things you need to know, Tuesday, the 17th of October, 2023.
Today, Palestinians in the West Bank lived through tensions from the Israel-Hamas war. Plus authorities open a hate crime investigation into the death of a Muslim boy in Illinois. And a ruling has been issued in one of former president Donald Trump's legal battles.
♦
As the Israeli defense forces continue to amass on Gaza's border, the US told 2,000 troops yesterday to prepare to deploy to other regions in the Middle East in response to the escalating conflict. And while Palestinians in Gaza continue to flee south after Israel evacuation orders, Palestinians in the West Bank are collectively holding their breath, hoping for the best, but fearing the worst.
My colleague, Dana Taylor, sat down with USA Today world affairs correspondent, Kim Hjelmgaard, who's on the ground in Israel and the West Bank to learn more.
Dana Taylor:
Hi Kim. Thanks for taking the time to come on. I know you're busy.
Kim Hjelmgaard:
Thanks for having having me.
Dana Taylor:
So Kim, what are the latest developments?
Kim Hjelmgaard:
So this is a multifaceted story. For the last 24, 48 hours, Israel has been gathering and marshaling its forces on the border with Gaza. And people are starting to wonder when is this ground invasion actually going to happen? The Israeli government has been a bit coy on that. They were suggesting that while the military is ready, it's now a political decision. And then at the same time, US Secretary Blinken has been in the region, he's been doing this diplomatic blitz of different countries. There are some rumors, completely unconfirmed that President Biden might be coming to Israel.
I will say that I think much of the focus of this story for now at least, is probably around the unfolding humanitarian situation. In Gaza hospitals, they are running out of blood. The reports are from Gaza that they're running out of space to bury bodies. About 600,000 people have been displaced and are moving south to an area that's closer to Egypt, crossing between southern Israel and Egypt that has been closed by the Egyptian authorities. And so Blinken and other diplomats are trying to negotiate some way for that gate to get open. So there's two or 3,000 dual nationals, including five to 600 Palestinian Americans who are gathering at that gate and hoping that it opens so that they can leave. This is a fast moving story with lots of different facets to it, and it's an evolving situation.
Dana Taylor:
We spent some time in the West Bank, a Palestinian area under a civilian rule by the PLO or Palestinian Authority governing body recognized by the US, EU and others. What are they saying about the attacks led by Hamas?
Kim Hjelmgaard:
I think the thing that is chiefly occupying a lot of people in the areas of the West Bank where I was over the weekend, is that their concern for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the humanitarian situation there is just awful. Really, there's no other way to put it. And so they're staring at their phones, they're getting messages from family members and friends, and they're just trying to make sense of the humanitarian toll of these bombing campaign that Israel is doing as it tries to root out Hamas militants.
I will say though in terms of the Palestinians that I encountered, there is also I guess I'd call it a reluctance to fully denounce Hamas or fully condemn the attacks on Israelis. Bear in mind that these are people who don't condone violence against civilians, but they look at this issue through just a completely different lens. They look at the attacks on the southern border in Israel as a consequence of this long and winding violent history that Israelis and Palestinians have together.
And so Palestinians civilians are not bloodthirsty monsters, nothing like that. But they also have seen thousands of Palestinian civilians who have died in Gaza, not just over the last week, but stretching back to 2005, 2007. So it's a complicated reaction they're having.
Dana Taylor:
Has the PLO condemned Hamas for its violent attacks against innocent Israelis? How are they navigating this crisis?
Kim Hjelmgaard:
Well, again, that is also tricky. The Palestinian President Abbas, a couple of days ago, he issued a statement that said that, of course he didn't approve the killing of Israeli civilians. Hamas was mentioned in that statement. But within a matter of a couple of hours, the word Hamas was actually taken off of that. Abbas issued a statement saying essentially that both sides need to show restraint. Both sides need to recognize that killing innocent civilians was not the way to do this. But again, the word Hamas was not mentioned in that statement.
Dana Taylor:
When violence against Palestinians in the West Bank is also up, what's happening there?
Kim Hjelmgaard:
Yes. Well, confrontations, clashes between Israeli security services and Palestinians, and indeed also Jewish settlers who live in communities illegally under international law in the West Bank. That is nothing new. There are Palestinians that get killed every day in the West Bank stretching back many years. Over the last week, some of that violence has escalated as the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces has been conducting raids into the West Bank, looking for people they think might be connected to this attack in Israel.
And so there's also been a lot more activity in terms of protests and demonstrations. And so over the last week, I think there's been just north of 55 or 56 Palestinians that have been killed in this violence. And this is not just people who are taking part in demonstrations. There's been other civilians, including children who've been caught up in this violence. And they feel that rightly or wrongly, that the violence that is perpetrated against them by Israel's military, by Jewish settlers in the West Bank doesn't get the same attention.
Dana Taylor:
Kim, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.
Kim Hjelmgaard:
Thanks for having me.

Taylor Wilson:
Back here in the US, authorities have opened an investigation into the death of a six-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois on Sunday. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the Justice Department opened a federal hate crime investigation into what led to the stabbing death of Wadea Al-Fayoume, and to the serious injuries of his mother. Garland warned that the incident would raise fears among Muslim communities about hate-filled violence. But he said the department would "use every legal authority at our disposal to bring justice to those who perpetrate illegal acts of hate."
The Will County Sheriff's Office said 71 year old Joseph Czuba was charged with first degree murder and two hate crime counts. The Sheriff's office shared that detectives determined he stabbed the woman, Hanaan Shahin, and her child because they were Muslim, amid news of the war in the Middle East. The man charged was reportedly the family's landlord.

US District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued a ruling yesterday in the case against former President Donald Trump. The case centered on allegations that Trump conspired to overturn the 2020 election as one of four he's now facing.
Dana Taylor spoke with USA Today Justice Department correspondent, Bart Jansen, for the story.
Dana Taylor:
Bart, thanks for joining me.
Bart Jansen:
Thanks for having me.
Dana Taylor:
Well, Bart, can you start with what the judge was ruling on? What were prosecutors asking for and what was the defense's argument?
Bart Jansen:
Basically, prosecutors were asking the judge to restrict what Trump could say or post on social media about figures associated with the case. They were concerned that he could use his substantial platform to criticize the judge, the prosecutors, potential witnesses, and potentially alienate the jury as well. And so they were trying to get the judge to put some basically guardrails around his comments so that they could have a fair trial.
Of course, the defense said that the government was trying to muzzle Trump as he campaigns for president in 2024. They said restrictions on his speech, his comments, his social media posts would inhibit his campaigning and that it was basically the Biden administration through the Justice Department trying to censor him in his campaign.
Dana Taylor:
And how did Judge Chutkan can rule?
Bart Jansen:
She offered a limited ruling from the bench, and legal experts are on the edge of their seats waiting to see what the written order will say. But what she said was that she ordered that Trump could not criticize members of her court staff, prosecutors, or potential witnesses in the case. And she said, needless to say, also, any of the families of any of those people. There was a limited gag order issued in Mr. Trump's New York fraud trial in which the judge said he prohibited him from posting anything about his court staff. That came after Trump posted on social media a picture of the judge's clerk with Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and raised the prospect that the clerk was a girlfriend of the Senate majority leader. And so that resulted in a gag order in New York City court. And now there is a similar order, don't criticize the court's staff or prosecutors.
Dana Taylor:
Why are prosecutors so concerned here?
Bart Jansen:
Trump has issued a number of statements, mostly through social media about the judge, about prosecutors. He's called Justice Department special counsel, Jack Smith, deranged and a psycho who looks like a crack head. He's criticized Judge Chutkan as a fraud dressed up as a judge and as a biased Trump hating judge. And the concern is that those sorts of comments might at least alienate people from him getting a fair trial, but potentially worse, inspire some of his supporters to commit violence against court staff or prosecutors.
As a matter of fact in one case, prosecutors cited the example of a Texas woman who was arrested in August and she's been charged with allegedly calling Judge Chutkan's chambers, addressing her using a racist term and threatening to kill anyone who went after President Trump. Now, Trump's lawyers say he can't be held accountable for third parties who react to his statements in that way. But that incident is what raised concerns among the prosecutors, and that's why they filed their request to have this gag order.
Dana Taylor:
Bart, could this ruling have any ramifications for Trump's other trials?
Bart Jansen:
We'll have to see if requests are made in the other criminal cases that he faces. He faces criminal cases in southern Florida, in Georgia, and in New York City. And the question would be whether prosecutors ask those judges for similar gag orders and then whether the judges in those courts make a similar decision.
Dana Taylor:
All right, thanks so much for your insights, Bart.
Bart Jansen:
Thanks for having me.

Last week, voters questioned five Republican presidential candidates in a series of town halls in Exeter, New Hampshire, hosted by Seacoastonline and the USA Today Network. Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, former Vice President Mike Pence, and entrepreneur, Vivek Ramaswamy, all spoke.
Many who attended the forum said they felt former President Donald Trump had the primary wrapped up, an issue centered in particular on climate change and social security. While candidates also repeatedly emphasized that voters who are not paying attention yet, want a solutions-oriented leader seeking common ground in 2024 not a bombastic style, likely a shot at Trump himself. It was also notable that both Haley and Ramaswamy had massive crowds with standing room only, perhaps an indicator that they're on a collision course in New Hampshire. You can read a full recap with a link in today's show notes.

Timeshares are making a comeback with younger Americans. Today over half of timeshare owners are Gen Z and millennial, and the average age of a timeshare owner is 39, according to a 2022 report from the American Resort Development Association. What's the appeal?
Many younger Americans work remotely these days, opening the door to more flexible travel schedules, and timeshares now include more than just a week in the same destination. They offer cruises, guided tours, houseboat rentals and more. But it's important to remember that while timeshares offer an affordable way to travel every year, they don't appreciate in value, unlike investing in a vacation home.

And before we go, a message of hope and giving. Today is the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. If you're able to, it's a good chance to pause and think about ways we can help.

Tuesday would have been Raoul A. Cortez's 118th birthday, and to celebrate the occasion he's being honored in today's Google Doodle.
Cortez was a Mexican-American broadcaster and activist who pioneered Spanish-language media in the United States by founding the first full-time Spanish language radio and television stations in the country, Google notes.
The design was illustrated by Mexican American artist Rafael Lopez and depicts the various roles Cortez played in Latino culture and civil rights in the U.S.
He was born in Veracruz, Mexico in 1905 and his family eventually immigrated to San Antonio, Texas. He entered the media scene in San Antonio as a reporter for "La Prensa," a San Antonio-based, Spanish-language daily newspaper.
He later began buying airtime on KMAC radio producing Spanish songs, comedic acts and sketches. Cortez applied for his own radio station and went live on-air in 1946 with the first Spanish-language radio station in America, with the slogan "La Voz Mexicana."
Google's 25th birthday:See special Google Doodle, plus other Easter eggs
The success of his radio show led to Cortez adding television to his broadcasting operation, becoming the first Latino-run American TV station in Spanish.
In addition to his contributions to media, Cortez was also a civil rights advocate for Latinos in the U.S. throughout his life. He oversaw the court case Delgado v. Bastrop Independent School District, which ended the segregation of Mexican Americans in Texas public schools.
The National Association of Broadcasters awarded Cortez the media excellence award, and the trade publication Radio Ink created an award − Medallas de Cortez Hispanic Radio Award − to celebrate Latino radio leaders, in his honor. He died in 1971 in San Antonio.
Cortez and his media programs were included in the American Enterprise exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in 2015.
"Like Raoul, you can make a positive change in life," Lopez told Google.
"No matter how big or small your contribution is, the changes will be lasting and remembered."
A family's outing to a wildlife center in Glen Rose, Texas came to a screeching halt last week when a giraffe slipped and fell onto their car's windshield, smashing it in the process.
Kari Hill was visiting the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center on Thursday with her teenage sons and infant granddaughter when the accident happened, FOX4NEWS reported.
Hill told the local news outlet that as they were touring the center, they stopped at the giraffe enclosure where a giraffe came and stuck his head in the sunroof as they fed him.
"We were laughing and loving it, until all of a sudden the giraffe appeared to lose his footing and fell onto the windshield of the car, and in the sunroof," Hill told Fox News. "Glass shot everywhere, all over us."
The visitor said that the entire family was covered in glass when the giraffe fell, and she feared that things were about to turn worse when the giraffe thankfully regained his footing and took off.
Hill quickly alerted the park's emergency hotline about the incident and pulled off to ensure that the children got the glass off them.
"What turned into a great family day, just cost me a huge car repair, and PTSD for us," Hill told Fox News.
However, she was grateful that things did not turn tragic.

Fossil Rim Wildlife Center is non-profit that specializes in captive breeding programs for indigenous and exotic endangered and threatened species. Guests can go on self-guided tours to see and feed some of the animals. However, visitors can only feed giraffes by hand. For other animals, the center recommends simply tossing the pellets onto the ground.
The Center did not respond to USA TODAY's request for a comment and update on the giraffe or the visitors. However, they told Fox News that the giraffe was not injured in the accident.

Eleven-year-old Ezekiel Zarate, couldn't wait to drive. Unfortunately, in his hometown of Treemonton, Utah, as in the rest of the state, you have to be 15 before you can get a learner permit to drive on public roads.
However, fortunately for Ezekiel, his loving dad, Michael, understood his impatience. So, when the opportunity arose to give his son a taster of what's to come, he took it.
Chancing on an empty private lot, he drove in and invited Ezekiel to take the wheel for his first driving lesson. And his son's reaction was a joy to behold.

Amazon driver Eligha Bryant delivered more than a package at one Chicago home recently. He dropped some fashion pointers.
Bryant, 42, is an Amazon Delivery Service Partner driver and was making a stop at the house on Oct. 7 when he saw the family that lives there gathered around their teenage son, Luke Breier. The teen was struggling to secure his tie, so Bryant stepped in to help.
Family members stood around smiling and laughing as he hyped the teenager up and made sure his tie was tidy and in place.
“You’re killing the game, young man,” Bryant said to the high school senior in a video shared online.
“He was clean. He reminded me of myself when I was coming up. That’s how I used to dress," said Bryant, who works for one of Amazon's third-party Delivery Service Partners, or companies that contract drivers to deliver packages. 
Bryant, a father of three sons and five girls, said he was passing along knowledge he had learned as a youngster himself. An avid churchgoer since his youth, he often dressed up in nice suits and attended with his mother, father and godparents.
So Bryant learned to tie a tie at the early age of 10. “All the brothers around me showed me how to,” he said.When he saw Breier struggling with his tie, Bryant felt like he should pay it forward.
Bryant’s story made it to the local news Monday and was covered by FOX 32 Chicago. His older sister called him to tell him about it.
“I didn't believe it at first but then I had other people calling me,” he said. “It made me feel good.”

Nicole Breier, the teenager’s mother, said Bryant did a great thing at a time where kind acts are needed.
“We live here in Chicago where racial tension is so high, especially in our neighborhood, which is known to be super racist,” she said. “It was just great to see two people reacting to each other regardless of color and that's the part that just really makes me happy.”
Her son, Luke Breier, said Bryant’s handiwork with his tie took his look to the next level. Bryant’s an awesome person for what he did, he said.
“It shows a lot about him,” Luke said. “It shows that he will go out his way to do something for someone else.”
Bryant said he was taught to love everybody and sees everyone as equal.
In addition to the suit the teen wore for homecoming, Luke also put on a flashy watch and Burberry cologne, which Bryant loved.
When he saw the teen in his homecoming gear, Bryant had nothing but good things to say.
“You got it,” he said. “You’re all the way clean. You’re all the way fresh.”

Lake Erie is now a world record holder!
The lake broke a world record over the weekend for the most waterspouts in a 24-hour period.
The International Centre for Waterspout Research announced that there were 181 waterspouts and funnel clouds observed over Lake Erie on Oct. 7, breaking the world waterspout record. According to the research center, one observer saw 72 waterspouts.
Users on X, formerly Twitter, shared photos and videos of the record-breaking waterspouts spotted over Lake Erie on Oct. 7.

A waterspout is a whirling column of air and water mist, according to the National Ocean Service. They fall into two categories: Fair weather waterspouts, which usually form along the dark flat base of a line of developing cumulus clouds, or tornadic waterspouts, which are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water.
The National Weather Service issues a tornado warning if a waterspout moves on shore, as they could cause significant damage and injuries. Fair weather waterspouts typically dissipate rapidly once they reach land, rarely moving far inland.
The National Weather Service office in Buffalo, New York issued a special marine warning Oct. 7, warning of favorable conditions for waterspouts to form and later posted that waterspouts had been observed.
The U.S. ranks first for the most waterspout sightings, according to the International Centre for Waterspout Research, accounting for 41.7% of all waterspouts sighted. Italy ranks second, at 10.2%. As of Monday, the research center reported have been 1,615 waterspouts observed around the world this year.
For Anne Patterson, who is studying to become a psychotherapist at age 55, the several thousand dollars in stimulus checks the government doled out to most Americans during the depths of the pandemic was a godsend.
Patterson, of East Bay, California,  has amassed $100,000 in student loan and other debt, allowing her to just barely pay the bills and forcing her to forgo frills such as dining out and going to the theater.
The government aid in 2020 and 2021 “was extremely helpful,” she says. “I could cover some of the basics like food and medicine.”
But the stimulus money is long gone and the resumption of student loan repayments this fall will saddle her with another $500 monthly expense, she estimates.
“I will certainly have to find places to cut back my spending,” she says, noting that she won’t be able to afford the final stage of a dental crown.

The pandemic-related savings and government aid that have helped prop up the U.S. economy over the past three years are dwindling, posing new strains for low- and moderate-income households and hazards for a nation at risk of slipping into recession by early 2024.
In interviews and a Harris Poll survey for USA TODAY, Americans whose COVID cash reserves are running low say they’re putting off home projects, eating out less, canceling subscriptions and taking out loans to make ends meet. Those kinds of strategies are likely to toss some cold water on U.S. consumer spending, which makes up 70% of economic activity.
“People have drawn down their savings and have less capital" to spend, says Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY-Parthenon, a consulting firm.
Other households say they still have a good chunk of their COVID savings or never relied on it to pay expenses. Overall, though, the shrinking trove – along with rising credit card interest rates, high inflation and a cooling job market -- could tip the nation into a recession by next year, some forecasters say.
“We are always unwilling to bet against the U.S. consumer, but we’re struggling here to see a plausible path to avoid a meaningful slowdown in their spending,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, recently wrote in a note to clients.
Early in the pandemic, Americans socked away $2.7 trillion in excess cash from three rounds of stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits, the pause in student loan repayments and laying low during the health crisis, among other assistance, Moody’s Analytics estimates.
For most people, the stimulus checks alone amounted to $3,200 per individual. All told the $2.7 trillion cash hoard represents an average $21,000 average per household. The stash helped people cushion the blow from high inflation and interest rates, or stay afloat while they took a hiatus from work due to health concerns or childcare duties. It gave others the financial leeway to hunt for a new job after getting laid off during the pandemic.
More than one-third of Americans say the money was “very important” to their financial stability during COVID and about one-quarter say it was “somewhat important,” according to a survey by Suffolk University Sawyer Business School and USA TODAY, conducted in September.
Now, that cache is running dry, by some estimates, at least for the most vulnerable.
Seventy-one percent of Americans built excess reserves during the pandemic and six in 10 of those savers say they’ve depleted most or all of that money, according to the USA TODAY/Harris Poll survey, conducted last month. Among that group, 90% have pared back their spending or plan to do so, compared with 62% who haven’t depleted their COVID funds.
Of those slashing spending, 65% are dining out less, 61% are cutting back experiences and 56% are buying fewer discretionary goods, the Harris Poll survey shows.
Patterson, the clinical psychology student, majored in cultural anthropology in college but couldn’t find a position in her field and spent decades in administrative jobs in industries such as mortgage servicing and title insurance. She decided to seek a more fulfilling career a few years ago and looks forward to a six-figure salary in 2024 but is still earning just $50,000 as part of an internship.
Besides putting off the dental crown, she says she’ll offset the student loan payments by shelving veterinary appointments for her three dogs, turning down the air conditioning in the summer and cutting back on twice-weekly DoorDash restaurant deliveries for her and her partner, who is disabled.
Fortunately, she says, she inherited her three-bedroom house from her mother and so doesn’t have a mortgage.
 “It’s scary but I feel like I’m going to be okay,” she says.
Across the U.S., exactly how much of the pandemic savings remains is something of an open question
Daco reckons $1.3 trillion is still left while Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, puts the figure at $1.8 trillion. Those estimates are based on recent government revisions that added $500 billion to $800 billion to estimated COVID savings totals.
By contrast, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco recently figured that a paltry $190 billion or so was left as of June and that sum likely would be exhausted by the July-September quarter. Agency officials are reworking the number based on the government revisions and wouldn’t comment. Even so, the cash buffer could run out in a few months, according to their most recent analysis.
Even if $1.3 trillion remains, as Shepherdson reckons, his analysis of Federal Reserve data suggests that it’s mostly in the hands of the top 20% of income earners who are less likely to spend it. Low- and middle-income people “have spent nearly all of their excess pandemic savings,” he says.
Zandi disagrees, saying lower and middle-income groups still have about 60% of their COVID stockpile.  
Yet that doesn’t mean they’ll spend it.
Christine Perron of Villa Rica, Georgia, says she saved several thousand dollars from stimulus checks and dining out about once a week during COVID, down from as many as four times a week before the pandemic.
Perron, 62, was a baker for a large grocery chain but retired a couple of years ago after receiving a legal settlement for a leg injury she sustained while fixing the roof of her house.
She used her COVID savings to cope with high inflation, including a $500 surge in the price of propane to heat her house for the winter. She also stocked up on toilet paper and other items that were in short supply early in the health crisis.
“It did take a lot of the pressure off,” she says of the government aid.
Perrone also renovated her deck at a cost of $4,800 and bought new carpet for a sitting room.
About half the money is left, Perron says, and she’d like to replace her kitchen floor. But prices have doubled or tripled since COVID amid high material and labor costs and she worries that she won’t recoup her investment when she sells her three-bedroom house.
“If I do it now, I’ll get ripped off,” she says.
Instead, Perron is biding her time and waiting to use the cash to buy a similar-sized house on a smaller parcel that requires less upkeep.
Others burned through their COVID savings long ago.
Michael and Colleen Barineau, of Lehigh Acres, Florida, were scrambling to pay bills before the pandemic. Michael, 62, a former construction worker, is on disability because of a work-related accident. Colleen, an administrative assistant for the medical department of a jail, couldn’t work for three weeks due to pandemic restrictions.
In 2020 and 2021, the couple used the stimulus checks to pay the mortgage on their two-bedroom house, the electric bill and other monthly expenses.
“They kept us afloat,” Michael says. “As soon as they came in the house they were gone.”
Since the money has run out, the Barineaus, who have a combined income of $45,000, have had to take out loans to make ends meet and sometimes fall behind, prompting calls from the mortgage company.
“It’s not fun,” Michael says. “You don’t know how you’re going to get the money.”
Some Americans are plagued by second thoughts about how they spent their windfall.
Terrie Wood, of Riner, Virginia, figures she and her husband, Alan, squirreled away about $5,000 from stimulus checks and hunkering down during COVID.
They needed the cash.
Terrie, 60, had to shut down her horse training and riding lessons business when sales plunged because of COVID. And while Alan earns a healthy six-figure salary as a mechanical engineer, she says the couple has struggled with large tax, insurance and debt payments for their 30-acre farm, tractor and pickup truck.  
They used their COVID savings to whittle down credit card bills and pay off a $3,000 loan for the tractor, wiping out a $580 monthly payment.
“It helped,” she says, “but it wasn’t significant enough.”
Now, she says she wishes they hadn’t paid off the tractor loan because the cash would be providing more breathing room.
“If we had that money it would be amazing,” she says, “so we’re not living paycheck to paycheck.” Plus,  “There would be play money that we don’t have.”

Others welcomed the pandemic cash bonanza but didn’t depend on it.
Jimothy Locklear, of Charlotte, North Carolina, said he, his wife, and two teenaged children have sharply cut back on dining out and traveling since the crisis, saving thousands of dollars. They also received the stimulus checks.
But Locklear, 45, a warehouse supervisor, and his wife, who owns a housecleaning business, didn’t need the money to pay the bills.
“It padded our savings account,” he says.
Before Oct. 7, my brother, his girlfriend and his kids were just parts of my greater identity and what I love and hold dear in this world. Now, as I live through a waking nightmare in which they have been taken hostage by Hamas − this part of my identity consumes me. And it's what drives and will drive my every action and thought, until my family comes home. 
My heart is heavy with sorrow, anger and, most of all, a profound sense of helplessness after an act so horrific and brutal that we never could have imagined it. 
Hell began for us when my wife and I called my brother, Yair Yaakov, during the first round of missile attacks the morning of Oct. 7, to check in on him; his girlfriend, Meirav Tal; and my two nephews, who are 16 and 12. They live in Nir Oz, a kibbutz in southern Israel, near the Gaza border. 
My brother reassured my wife that they were in their shelter/safe room. His two sons were staying at their mother’s house, and my brother, no matter how much he may have wished he could race to the rest of his family and bring them all together to protect them, couldn’t leave the safe room in his house at the kibbutz.
We survived the Hamas attack on Israel.What haunts us now is the blockade of Gaza.
They were strictly instructed to stay in place, and they heard gunshots outside the house. Everyone was frozen as they faced the approaching fear and horror of Hamas terrorists closing in. 
About a half hour later, Meirav sent us an audio message on WhatsApp. Her voice was shaking as she told us that terrorists had entered their home. Yair held the shelter’s door to keep the attackers out. But in the end, he did not prevail. This was the last time we had contact with them. 
Our family was thrown into darkness. We searched every minute of that day for any sign of them. We tried using Apple’s “Find my iPhone” feature to no avail. We fought fear and panic all day to remain focused on locating our family. 
Later that afternoon, the mother of my nephews shared with us through tears that she had confirmation that her two sons had been kidnapped. Our world collapsed around us.
For nearly 30 agonizing hours, we had no idea where any of them were. We reached out to every level of every authority we could, asking for help in finding Yair, Meirav and my nephews. The silence that returned became overwhelming as we learned that we were going to face this nightmare primarily on our own. We turned to social media, sharing pictures and heartfelt pleas, hoping someone in our connected web would come forward with information.
Then we learned the fate of my family when a friend of Yair shared a video showing that Hamas had taken them hostage. It showed the terrifying moments of Yair and Meirav's abduction after Hamas terrorists threw grenades to break the safe room’s door. 
This wasn't just a crime; it was an inversion of humanity. Innocent people, including children and women, were forcibly taken from their homes where they should feel safe and torn away from their lives, their families and their communities. They are now pawns in a war.

The days since have been dark with just one glimmer of light. Yair's oldest daughter and her boyfriend, who were staying in yet another house in the kibbutz, managed to keep their shelter secure and were eventually rescued by the Israel Defense Forces.
As a family, we appeal to the world for one thing: the safe return of our loved ones. We were brought up to believe that everyone has a family and deserves to be treated humanely. Hamas operates in stark contrast to these principles.
Our only plea is to bring our kidnapped family members back home safely. We don’t know if they are being fed. We don’t know the state of their health. We don’t know where they are. The uncertainty about their fate is what our lives are defined by now, and we are desperate for the day that we can receive good news about their well-being. 
Until then, I am a brother and an uncle who refuses to give up.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was able to transport hundreds of people from Israel to Florida just days after announcing an evacuation initiative by tapping into an existing rescue program, Project Dynamo, that likely would have gone forward with the effort regardless of the state’s support.
Florida has paid for five flights to evacuate people out of Israel between Friday and Sunday, including one that landed in Tampa Sunday night with 270 people, but Project Dynamo coordinated everything else, according to the group’s CEO and founder Bryan Stern.
Project Dynamo was founded in 2021 to help rescue people from Afghanistan after American troops withdrew from the country and has conducted missions everywhere from Ukraine to Sudan. The flight to Tampa Sunday was the group’s 602nd evacuation mission.
Stern spoke about the rescue missions during a news conference Monday and said he was raising money to pay for the Tampa flight when the state of Florida stepped in to offer assistance.
“We were fundraising right up until Gov. DeSantis and his office came in… bottom line is we would have figured it out,” Stern said. “We’ve done it six hundred and one times without government help, six hundred and two was not going to be the one that we failed on. But it makes it so much easier when you have backing by a state entity for sure.”
Many commercial flights out of Israel were canceled following a surprise attack by Hamas and subsequent retaliatory measures by Israel. That has left many Americans struggling to find a way out of Israel.
DeSantis declared a state of emergency last week and directed the Florida Division of Emergency Management to coordinate evacuation efforts. The governor, running what now appears to be a longshot campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, was at the Tampa airport Sunday to welcome the evacuees from Israel, which included 269 Americans – including roughly 70 Floridians – and one native of the Czech Republic.
Stern said he was grateful for Florida's financial support, the first time a government agency has funded one of his evacuation efforts, but also made it clear that he would've done everything to get people home safely, regardless of whether Florida funded the effort.
"Would it have been possible? I'll tell you that I wasn't going to leave them behind and I'm not trying to stay in Israel a moment longer than I need to so we would've figured it out, for sure," Stern said.
DeSantis' trip to Tampa on Sunday was “the first time an American politician has ever met us home,” Stern said.
The evacuation flight to Tampa involved gathering people from more than 12 different areas across Israel, Stern said. On the flight were Ron and Linda Neumann, who are trying to become dual citizens of Israel and the United States, and their dog.
The Neumanns have been living in Israel recently, but also live in Melbourne.
Ron Neumann said after two flights out of Israel were canceled he tried to find a way out of the country by contacting U.S. State Department officials and state officials in Florida. Neither effort was successful, but he heard about Project Dynamo through a friend and they helped him get on the flight to Tampa.
“It was a miracle from God because we had no way to get out," Neumann said.
Stern didn't know the exact cost of the most recent flight from Israel to Florida, but said the average cost to charter a plane from Tampa to Israel right now is around $2 million. The governor's office and the Florida Division of Emergency Management provided no answers to questions from the USA TODAY Network - Florida on costs of the trips.
The first Florida arrival of what supporters are calling "DeSantis Airlines" come at the same time the Biden administration is chartering flights from Israel to European destinations so passengers could book connecting flights home. DeSantis has slammed the White House for "dragging its feet" on the charters and said its flights "dump people in Europe."
“But people don't need to be dumped in Europe," DeSantis said in a video posted on the social media website X by his campaign. "They want to get home.”
The flights from Israel occurred the same weekend CBS News' 60 Minutes aired a segment Sunday critical of DeSantis' actions in September 2022, when his administration lured about 50 mostly Venezuelan asylum-seekers from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, off the Massachusetts' coast, with the false promise of jobs and housing.
Money for that trip came from a $12 million fund established within the state's Division of Emergency Management for relocating undocumented migrants from within Florida to other locations. The program has since been expanded and rewritten by the Florida Legislature to authorize DeSantis' action, after its legality was challenged in a handful of lawsuits.
DeSantis while campaigning in Iowa, home of the first Republican presidential nomination contest, has cited the Martha's Vineyard trip as proof of his commitment to combating illegal immigration and to underscore the failures of the Biden administration. DeSantis' White House bid probably lives or dies based on how he performs in Iowa.
Those evacuated from Israel by the state-financed effort focused their praise on Project Dynamo, touting the team's skills and efficiency.
"I'm humbled," said Linda Neumann. "To think that people risked their lives to come get us and our fellow Jews out of a war zone. I thank God for getting us out."

WASHINGTON — The militant group Hamas launched a shocking attack against Israel less than two weeks ago on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, leading to thousands of deaths and retaliation by Israeli forces in an area known as the Gaza Strip. 
The conflict has put millions of Israeli and Palestinian lives at risk as attacks have intensified day by day with hospitals and homes destroyed and some civilians held hostage. The death toll of Americans in the country has risen to 30, and more than a dozen Americans remain missing.
The chaos embroiling the Middle East has also stirred confusion among people in the U.S. seeking to understand the devastation in the area. Here’s a closer look at some lingering questions about the conflict. 
The Israel-Hamas war explained: Understanding the conflict in Gaza amid rush to evacuate
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back to the early 20th century, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The tension began after the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, following the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were murdered by the Nazi regime.
For decades, Palestinians have fought for self-determination and self-governance, while Israeli forces sought to expand territory. 
Hamas' offensive is connected not only to specific Israeli military activity but to what the group views as a campaign to rob Palestinians of their land and displace them by force. For years, the group has vowed to annihilate the state of Israel and claimed responsibility for deadly attacks. 
It is very difficult for Palestinians to leave Gaza.
Gaza is surrounded by blockades imposed by Israel and Egypt, which restrict movement. Israel prevents access to and from Gaza by sea and air. Land movement is restricted to three crossings: the Egypt-controlled Rafah crossing and Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings, which Israel controls. 
The U.N. has said that mass evacuation orders in the area will affect more than a million people. A total evacuation would mean the entire 2.23 million population of Gaza would have to squeeze into the southern half of the strip. Gaza, which is only 25 miles long in its entirety and just over twice the size of Washington, D.C., is the 63rd-most densely inhabited urban region in the world.
Many are voicing uncertainty about safety anywhere in the strip if they leave their homes.
The West Bank is east of Israel, and about three million Palestinians live there, most of them Muslim Arabs. The West Bank also contains a number of Jewish holy sites.
Israel occupies the West Bank, though the Palestinian Authority, controlled by the Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the region. 
Small Israeli communities called kibbutzim have been affected by the conflict. A kibbutz, which means gathering in Hebrew, is a kind-of communal body traditionally focused around farming or other environmental goals.
The first kibbutz was established 90 years ago. Today, approximately 125,000 people live on about 250 kibbutzim, CNN reported.
David Leach, author of the book "Chasing Utopia: The Future of the Kibbutz in a Divided Israel," told NPR that historically, early kibbutzim “were exercises in radical democracy.”
Former President Donald Trump had criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at an event in Florida last week, saying that the countries’ intelligence failed and that its enemies were “very smart.” He also said Netanyahu was not prepared in a Fox News Radio interview.
However, Trump walked back his comments on Monday to Iowa voters, saying that he supported Israel in its war with Hamas. 
Other Republican candidates, such as Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley and Chris Christie, have all supported standing with Israel.
“I think it is wrong when we in the United States or in the UN or anybody else create a false equivalence between Israel defending its own homeland versus the behaviors of the terrorists who target Israel,” said Ramaswamy during a town hall event last week presented by Seacoastonline and the USA TODAY Network.
The incumbent, Democratic President Joe Biden, has expressed strong support for Israel since the beginning of the conflict and will visit the country Wednesday.
Many organizations are collecting donations to help families living in Israel and Gaza.
One such organization is the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which has provided medical attention and basic necessities to vulnerable children for the past 30 years and opened a new fundraising campaign after the latest attack. 
Another organization is IsraAID, an Israel-based group that is also collecting funds to help affected communities. IsraAID helps coordinate humanitarian activities in shelters housing Gaza border region evacuees and provides mental health resources to families, according to its website.
Other organizations include:

Arizona State University police say they are investigating an incident in which a queer faculty member was confronted and injured on the school's campus.
An official with the conservative group Turning Point USA said late Thursday night that two of their "crew members" were involved in the altercation.
The incident occurred Wednesday afternoon in Tempe, according to police spokesperson Adam Wolfe.
A Monday Night Football matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and the Los Angeles Chargers led to two men being hospitalized after stabbing each other.
The knife fight occurred around 9:40 p.m. Monday night, San Antonio police told local station KSAT, and involved two men in their 50s.
The men lived close to each other, said police, and got into an argument over noise while watching the game.
Police say at some point during the altercation, both men drew knifes and stabbed each other multiple times.
Both were soon after transported to local hospitals and are expected to make full recoveries.
The SAPD told KSAT that an investigation is ongoing and they have yet to determine what charges, if any, the men will be faced with.
The names of the men involved in the altercation have not yet been released.
The SAPD did not immediately respond to request for comment.

We always want what we don’t have, whether it’s a different hair color or longer lashes. Now, in what appears to be the rebirth of a beauty trend with a storied history, people are giving themselves pseudo dimples — and not the surgical kind, which yes, is a thing.
Behold the “dimple maker”: a cherry-shaped device with a curved wire sporting marble-like balls on each end. All you have to do, according to people on TikTok, is pry the device open and slip it onto your cheek as the balls clamp the inner and outer sides together. 
Over time, the device may leave impressions on the muscles and fat pads in your cheek, although plastic surgeons who spoke to USA TODAY aren’t convinced they’ll last long. Doctors came to the same conclusion nearly 90 years ago after a woman named Isabelle Gilbert invented a similar product.
Today, interest persists and is growing. The hashtag #dimplemaker has over 60 million views on TikTok, with the devices springing up on Etsy and other shops for about $15. 
Dimple makers are relatively safe, and are a less invasive alternative to a dimpleplasty — the surgical removal of muscle inside the cheek to create dimples — but experts say that they may still pose risks, such as permanent nerve damage and scarring.
“You want to be careful with home remedies and fads because nobody's counseling you about complications,” said Dr. Alan Matarasso, board vice president of development for the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. “You especially have to be careful with anything on the face that's not reversible.”
Dimple makers compress the skin and underlying fat in the cheek, squeezing fluid out of surrounding tissue and creating a temporary inward dent, according to Dr. Jonathan Kaplan, a plastic surgeon with Pacific Heights Plastic Surgery in San Francisco, California, who likens the device to a waist trainer. 
It’s unclear how long it takes to work, but results will vary depending on how tight the clamp is, how long it’s worn and the amount of fat in the cheek, experts say. 
Dimple makers can be helpful if you’re interested in getting a dimpleplasty, Kaplan said, because you can see how you’ll look with dimples and what placement best suits your face. 
Dimple makers that are too tight and worn for too long could potentially restrict blood flow to the spot on the cheek that’s being compressed, leading to the death of fat tissue (necrosis), Kaplan said.
A hard lump could develop in your cheek as a result, but it’s unlikely to be noticeable from the outside and can go away with time, Kaplan said. If enough blood supply is cut off, your skin cells in the area could die, which can leave a scab and scar. 
A more unlikely yet still plausible risk of wearing dimple makers is nerve damage in the face, which could theoretically lead to paralysis in the upper and lower lip, Matarasso  said, giving you a "I just had a cavity filled at the dentist"-type of smile. 
“When you put pressure on a nerve, you have a certain amount of time until the nerve dies and then it's not reversible,” Matarasso said. “Think of it as a wet match — sometimes it'll dry off, but if you soak that match enough, it's never going to strike a fire.”
Dimplepasties carry similar risks because a surgical knife could pierce a nerve, but the likelihood of that happening is “extraordinarily low,” Matarasso said. Dimple makers, on the other hand, may pose greater risks of nerve damage because you’re compressing a larger surface area of the cheek, he added. 
However, Kaplan speculates that most people wouldn’t be able to tolerate the pain associated with these kinds of injuries for long enough to sustain any kind of permanent damage. 
As dimple makers become more popular, it's far from uncommon for 26-year-old Miya Ulatowski, who was born with dimples, to be accused of faking hers: “When I first started seeing those comments, it threw me off because I didn’t even know dimple surgery was a thing.”
While Ulatowski doesn’t understand dimples’ appeal, the Ohio resident said that she’s “a big supporter of people doing whatever they need to feel happy and confident in how they look.” 
Meanwhile, people who opt for a dimpleplasty are frequently bombarded with hate about their decision to pursue the procedure. Merissa Fernandes, 32, of Massachusetts, said she has received pushback online since undergoing surgery in June, but acknowledges that it’s a consequence of being open about body modifications. 
“I’ve always adored people who had dimples, so I got the surgery because I wanted to,” Fernandes said. “I’m not doing anything for the opinions of others, I just think it’s valuable to be as transparent as possible.”  
I realize this may be asking a lot, but wouldn’t it be great if so many of our politicians weren’t unscrupulous creeps? 
These days, after scanning the headlines about the folks “running” the government, I often feel like I need a shower. 
It seems like an almost daily occurrence that a current or former elected official lands in court for one shady misdeed or another. Government corruption almost seems normal.
It shouldn’t be.
Between the alarming attack on Israel this month and the Republicans bungling their House leadership, some of the latest scandals have gotten the amount of attention they deserve.
Republicans fiddle while world burns:Listen up, Republicans. The world is in chaos, so why are you playing stupid games?
Let me refresh you on what’s been happening. 
The charges keep coming for Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey. A career politician to his core, Menendez has spent decades in Congress, between his time in the House and now the Senate. 
His seniority earned him the powerful position of chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which he is now charged with abusing for his personal gain. Menendez had to step down from that role while his case plays out, but he doesn’t appear to be leaving office anytime soon – at least of his own accord. 
Last week, Menendez was slapped with additional charges of conspiracy to act as a foreign agent. That is on top of last month's indictment on bribery charges. 
Stop and think about that: The (now former) chair of Foreign Relations, a committee that reviews treaties with other nations and votes on all diplomatic nominations, is accused of acting as a foreign agent for hire.
Harvard for Hamas?Something is very twisted on America's university campuses.
What he’s accused of is extremely serious. Menendez – along with his wife – is charged in part with benefiting the Egyptian government as well as several businessmen in exchange for hundreds of thousands in gold bars and cash. Some of the loot was found at his home – hidden in closets and clothes, which doesn’t seem suspicious at all.
And for good measure, throw in a Mercedes convertible worth more than $60,000, which prosecutors say business executives purchased for the senator and his wife in exchange for Menendez interfering in an insurance fraud case.
It's not the first time Menendez has had a run-in with the law involving bribery charges. In 2017, a federal jury deadlocked on whether to convict the senator, which led to a mistrial.
See a pattern here? 
Menendez, according to historians, may be the first sitting senator in U.S. history to have been indicted in two different criminal cases, a distinction no one should strive for. 
Now, if you’re a liberal, I can bet what you’re thinking: “Well, look at former President Donald Trump!” or “How about Rep. George Santos?” 
Trump has been indicted in four criminal cases, as well as a civil fraud case, all of which are unprecedented for a former president (who also is, of course, the leading Republican candidate for president in 2024). 
Time for change:Sure, Trump is awful. But that doesn't mean Biden is a good choice for president.
Then there's curious George. Last week, a new indictment alleges Santos stole the identities of campaign donors and used donors’ credit cards as his own personal piggy bank. That comes five months after he was charged with other financial crimes. 
It’s really no wonder that his campaign coffers are in arrears. 
There’s also the fact that Santos made up his entire résumé. He’s a first-class sleazebag. 
Yet, unlike Menendez, Santos is a freshman congressman, one who is unlikely to make it to his sophomore term (assuming voters are paying attention). 
Menendez had a position of leadership and real power, and Democrats kept promoting him despite earlier warning signs. What Menendez is accused of doing deserves to be scrutinized on its own accord. 
Bribing for access:Menendez indictment raises questions about Hunter Biden case – and DOJ
The question remains: What to do with these bad actors? 
It’s easy for Democrats to scream and yell that Santos is a disgrace and must go. And Republicans like to do the same to Democrats. For instance, Republicans have called for Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a Democrat from New York, to be expelled from the House after he pulled a fire alarm before a key vote to keep the government open. Bowman says it was a "mistake," and his office released a memo in his defense that labeled Republicans as "Nazis."
Regardless, it’s an odd “mistake” for a former school principal to make and a bizarre incident, even if it doesn’t rise to the level of expulsion. But I digress. 
The bar for expelling a House member is high, and it has only happened a few times in our country’s history. Of the 15 times the Senate has expelled a member, 14 occurred during the Civil War for supporting the Confederacy. 
Unfortunately, partisanship often comes before principle. The fact remains that with thin margins of control in the House and Senate, both sides need as many warm bodies as they can get, regardless of how repugnant. 
Some New York Republicans have called for the House to expel Santos, although that’s not likely to happen. The same goes for the Senate. Quite a few Democrats have called on Menendez to resign, but they’re not likely to take the matter further. 
At the least, Menendez and Santos could be censured by their colleagues and face that embarrassment. 
These men deserve their day in court, but I'm less certain they should be roaming the halls of Congress.
The surest way to rid the government of (alleged) weasels is for voters to make sure they don’t get the chance again.

The USA TODAY Opinion section publishes analysis, argument and essays on a wide variety of subjects. We're looking for timeliness (pegged to news), persuasion pitched to the other side, new information, novel arguments, revelatory insights, passion without partisanship, first-person experience, original reporting that reveals fresh angles and makes news, expert knowledge, and/or a topic that will drive conversation on social media and in the real world.
We accept only pieces that are submitted exclusively to USA TODAY. We do not accept material that has been published on blogs, social media or anywhere else.
Columns typically run 550 to 750 words. They should be pasted directly into an email and sent to theforum@usatoday.com. Pieces should include links (URLs, not headlines or footnotes) to back up quotes and factual material. People featured in columns must be identified by their real, full names.
We do not publish open letters, class projects or material that has been submitted to multiple outlets. Rebuttals to editorials and columns published in USA TODAY should be submitted as letters to the editor, not as full-length op-eds.
Due to the volume of submissions, we can’t respond to all columns sent to us. If our Opinion team is interested in yours, you will hear from us within three business days.
Submissions may be edited for accuracy, clarity, style, standards and length. 
Please include with your submission a short biography, two sentences at most, to run at the end of your column, as well as a current photograph, to which you own publishing rights. If you or a business, trade group or other institution with which you are associated stands to gain financially or in any other way from your column, you should disclose that information in detail. In most cases, it should also be included in the body of the piece or in the author's biographical information.
Columns are accepted for online publication; print publication is not guaranteed. All columns published by USA TODAY are available for use online and in print by the more than 250 properties in the USA TODAY Network. They include Austin; Bergen County, New Jersey; Burlington, Vermont; Cincinnati; Columbus, Ohio; Des Moines; Detroit; El Paso, Texas; Indianapolis; Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Milwaukee; Nashville, Tennessee; Phoenix, Reno, Nevada; Palm Beach, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware.
Authors may post their columns elsewhere 48 hours after they are published at USA TODAY. By submitting a column to USA TODAY and agreeing to its publication, authors are granting exclusive rights to the piece to the USA TODAY Network for 48 hours and non-exclusive rights thereafter.

Corrections to published letters or columns follow USA TODAY guidelines.
