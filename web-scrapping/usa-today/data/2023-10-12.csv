A series of town hall forums presented by USA TODAY, the USA TODAY Network and Seacoastonline for Republican presidential hopefuls are set to take place in Exeter, New Hampshire this week.
The forums will take place at Exeter Town Hall, where many former presidents, including Donald Trump and Barack Obama, have campaigned. The forums are scheduled to take place Oct. 10-15.
Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson kicked off the event at 5 p.m. Tuesday and you can watch the replay here.
Exeter Town Hall has the distinction of being the only location remaining in New Hampshire where Abraham Lincoln spoke in 1860, just months before launching his presidential campaign.
Voters who attend will have a chance to directly ask candidates the questions on their mind and receive in-person responses.
The town hall forums will be streamed on USA TODAY and on USA TODAY Network outlets including Seacoastonline.com, Portsmouth Herald, Hampton Union, Foster's Daily Democrat and Exeter News-Letter.
The five candidates that have committed to meeting with voters are Asa Hutchinson, Nikki Haley, Doug Burgum, Mike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy.
Here is the full schedule for the Exeter Town Hall forums this week. All times are Eastern.
The forums are free and open to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis. At the start of the forums, candidates make their brief opening remarks before proceeding to answer questions from the audience and engage in a meaningful dialogue about various issues.  
The attacks came by land, sea, air – and online. 
Terror propaganda − violent videos and graphic images of kidnappings and murders of civilians and soldiers that flooded social media from the deadly cross-border incursion into Israel − was a key element in Hamas’ military campaign, said Graham Brookie, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.
Hamas streamed from the war zone “in closer to real-time than in past conflicts,” indicating that the online strategy “was an essential part of the overall planning for their attack on Israel” to take advantage of how hyperconnected Israel is with its widespread use of smartphones and social media, Brookie said.
Veterans of conflict zones on Brookie’s team tracking Hamas' digital footprint were struck by the ferocity and volume of the footage, the likes of which he said it had never seen, he said.
The effects could become more grave if Hamas makes good on a threat to broadcast executions of hostages, Brookie said. Some Hamas officials have since walked back the threat.
Spreading propaganda on social media networks – especially those with more lax moderation systems – is a low-cost and highly effective tactic that is increasingly being deployed by terrorist groups, said Colin P. Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group, a global intelligence and security consultancy.
The videos and images from the deadly attacks posted by Hamas-affiliated accounts were shared by Hamas allies and unwitting participants around the globe, Clarke said.
The tactic is pulled from the playbooks of the Islamic State and al-Qaida, which experts said pioneered the viral form of psychological warfare by livestreaming beheadings and other graphic footage.
“This is the nature of asymmetric warfare – you've got to utilize tools that are going to make you seem bigger and more powerful than you are,” Clarke said. “For Hamas, it costs them nothing to videotape something and send it out there, and now everyone thinks that they're creeping around every corner.”
Hamas fired off posts from official accounts on the encrypted messaging and social media app Telegram that ricocheted to X, formerly Twitter, and beyond. 
Telegram – which allows messaging between users but also has a “Channel” function that works similarly to X – has a long history of being used by terrorists, among them the Islamic State, or ISIS. The platform, often labeled by extremism experts as “Terrorgram,” is increasingly embraced by domestic extremists in the U.S. in recent years because of its almost nonexistent moderation. 
“As soon as something posts on Telegram, we see this crossflow of content to mainstream platforms, either intentionally or just through the oxygen of amplification,” Brookie said.
X, which gutted its trust and safety teams under new owner Elon Musk, was unprepared for the wave of terror propaganda that then spread to other social media platforms and messaging apps like WhatsApp.
This week, X said it was removing newly created Hamas-affiliated accounts and coordinating with industry peers “to try and prevent terrorist content from being distributed online.” It also recommended that people adjust their sensitive media settings if they don’t want to see disturbing content. 
The U.K. summoned social media executives Wednesday to demand platforms remove violent content of the Hamas attacks on Israel.
Telegram and X did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
If social media sites continue to erode guardrails and safeguards, Clarke warned, what is happening today will get worse.
“This is just the facet of what’s called ‘fourth generation warfare,’ or ‘modern warfare’ in this era,” he said. “So, whatever the next conflict is, it doesn't really matter, you're going to see this on steroids.”   
Once propaganda and disinformation reaches X, the platform is allowing it to be shared and even monetized, a report from the Tech Transparency Project found.
The report, an advance copy of which was provided exclusively to USA TODAY, found several premium subscriber accounts – which pay a fee of $8 a month to the platform – sharing Hamas propaganda including violent and graphic images of the attacks on Israel.
According to the report, some video content appears to violate X’s “violent and hateful entities policy,” which prohibits promotion of terrorist organizations and their propaganda. It also appears to violate an X policy stating that the platform will remove accounts sharing content produced by terrorists, the report states.
Despite X’s announcement that it was working to remove Hamas-affiliated accounts, TTP researchers "found no evidence that X had restricted the accounts sharing the Hamas attack videos,” the report says. It also notes that in some cases, X ran advertisements in the comments under the video posts.
The TTP report found several instances of “verified” X users, some with more than 500,000 followers, spreading uncensored Hamas propaganda videos. 
One clip posted to X shows bodycam footage of Hamas militants going room-to-room in an Israeli military base firing automatic weapons. Bloodied bodies lie on the ground in the video, which has been watched more than 60,000 times.   
“It's been nearly 10 years since the Islamic State made heavy use of social media to amplify its propaganda and recruitment efforts. Although some platforms have improved at reducing the spread of Islamic State content, today we see Hamas deploying very similar tactics on X,” TTP director Katie A Paul told USA TODAY. “The company has monetized the spread of Hamas propaganda despite its clear violations of X policy. X needs to effectively enforce the rules it has on the books as the conflict continues.”  
Brookie says social media platforms are being forced to grapple with a multi-front crisis to shield users from terror propaganda, misleading information, hate speech and violent and graphic images and footage.
“The amount of content is going to be more than any team, whether it’s at a platform or a research team like mine, or a journalism outlet or organization could possibly sift through,” he said. “That changes the frame from who’s doing well to who’s doing the least bad in a hard situation.” 
The major platforms are working with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) which was founded by Facebook, Microsoft, X and YouTube in 2017 to prevent terrorists and violent extremists from exploiting digital platforms. 
“In this rapidly evolving situation, we continue to work with our members to identify and follow trends in content and activity online related to terrorist and violent extremist actors involved in the offline violence,” GIFCT said in a statement. “This includes the possibility that a range of terrorist and violent extremist networks and groups may seek to exploit the conflict for their own purposes, as we have seen in past events.”
Facebook, YouTube and TikTok say they have poured resources into moderating content from the Israel-Hamas war. 
“After the terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel on Saturday, we quickly established a special operations center staffed with experts, including fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers, to closely monitor and respond to this rapidly evolving situation,” Meta said in a statement.
The major platforms prohibit content produced by terrorist organizations including Hamas as well as footage showing hostages. 
CONCORD, N.H.−Ron DeSantis began a two-day New Hampshire swing Thursday by displaying a revamped campaign style that includes amped-up criticism of Donald Trump.
DeSantis focused on Trump's comments Wednesday criticizing the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netahnyahu and his government over the war with Hamas, and describing Hezbollah militants as "very smart."
"Now is not the time to be attacking our ally," DeSantis told supporters at the New Hampshire State House.
Several Republicans noted that, after the 2020 election, Trump attacked Netanyahu for hailing Biden as the president-elect.
"It’s clear he’s angry at Netanyahu for recognizing Trump lost in 2020," said a statement from Never Back Down, a pro-DeSantis political action committee. "Trump puts himself first."
What did Trump say about Netanyahu?Trump blames Netanyahu for Hamas attacks, calls Hezbollah leaders 'very smart'
DeSantis spoke after formally filing for January’s New Hampshire primary, a contest he declared “wide open” despite Trump’s huge lead in polls.
“If you want to change from Trump, I think I’m the best leader,” DeSantis said, adding that he gives Republicans “the best chance to be able to do well” in a general election.
DeSantis, who has seen his support erode after months of attacks from Trump, has gradually escalated counter-criticism of the former president throughout the campaign. He has been more pointed in recent days, part of a strategy adjustment that includes more interviews with mainstream media outlets.
The Florida governor plans to spend Thursday touring the northern part of the state along with members of his political action committee, Never Back Down.
He is scheduled to participate Friday in traditional events, including a "Politics and Eggs" breakfast hosted by the New Hampshire Institute of Politics.
DeSantis and other Republican candidates are scheduled to address the state Republican Party's "First in the Nation Leadership Summit" in Nashua, N.H. this weekend.
Sen. Robert Menendez was charged Thursday with conspiracy to act as a foreign agent, in a fresh indictment that updated bribery allegations unveiled in federal court in September.
Menendez and two co-defendants, wife Nadine Menendez and Wael Hana, were charged with conspiracy to represent the government of Egypt and Egyptian officials. The indictment cites the three with meeting at Manhattan restaurants with Egyptian officials on June 30, 2018, and Sept. 21, 2019, as part of the alleged conspiracy.
The Federal Agents Registration Act requires people who represent foreign governments trying to influence U.S. policy to register with the Justice Department. Violations carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Menendez and his co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to the charges and he remains in the Senate, although he surrendered his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee until the case is resolved. The trial is scheduled May 6.
Menendez faces corruption charges, brought by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, for allegedly accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from three businessmen in exchange for helping them enrich themselves and trying to get them out of trouble, according to an indictment unsealed on Sept. 22 New York.
A former Hamas leader’s call for protests around the world has some Americans who are planning travel in the coming days weighing agonizing choices days after the militant group's deadly attack on Israeli communities.
Khaled Meshaal’s recordings reviewed by Reuters have reverberated on social media and stoked rumors that a “jihad” in the “squares and streets of the Arab and Islamic world” could lead to violence Friday.
For those Americans in Israel who want to leave, the White House said the U.S. government will arrange charter flights to Europe starting Friday.
Natalie Sanandaji, 28, from Long Island, New York, was in Greece on Thursday deciding on flight options home.
“I’m hoping to get home as soon as possible, but there’s this fear of traveling on the 13th, tomorrow,” Sanandaji, who was in Israel during the attack, told USA TODAY. “People are telling us to avoid crowded places and I’m looking at these layovers in Egypt or London or Paris and those are high-risk places.”
A White House spokesman said Thursday the U.S. death toll from the Hamas attacks rose to 27, a day after the State Department raised its alert level for American travelers to Israel and the West Bank, urging them to reconsider their plans. Travel advisories already are in place urging increased caution for U.S. citizens traveling to Jordan and Turkey and advising them to reconsider travel to Egypt and Lebanon because of terrorism. "Terrorists may attack with little or no warning," the agency warns.
The uncertainty follows a trip to Israel by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv in a show of support.
In the U.S., National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said federal, state and local authorities are working to identify and disrupt any threats toward the Jewish community. He said 14 Americans remain missing in Israel.

∎Two Palestinians were killed in the occupied West Bank when Israeli settlers opened fire at a funeral for three Palestinians who had been killed in a settler rampage the day before, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported.
∎Israel officials were notified by neighboring Egypt that an attack was possible three days before it happened, says Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denies the claim, but the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee blamed "failure of intelligence.''
US death toll risesUS death toll rises to 22; lawmaker says Egypt warned Israel before attack: Updates
Blinken expressed U.S. solidarity with Israel, its military operations in Gaza and its goal of destroying the militant Hamas organization during his meeting with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.
"Hamas has only one agenda, to destroy Israel and to murder Jews," Blinken said. "No country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizens or return to the conditions that allowed it to take place."
The war has already claimed over 2,500 lives on both sides. International aid groups warn that the death toll may rise after Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, fuel and electricity to Gaza.
Blinken said victims from Saturday's attack include citizens from 36 nations. He said Hamas, instead of promoting the well-being of Gazans, rules repressively and funnels resources to "terror tunnels and rockets."
Blinken said the Israeli government shared photos and videos of Hamas' atrocities and called them "overwhelming.''
"A baby, an infant, riddled with bullets. Soldiers beheaded. Young people burned alive in their cars or in their highway runs,'' Blinken said. "It's simply depravity in the worst imaginable way.''
The social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, has removed or labeled tens of thousands of pieces of "illegal" content that encouraged violence or misrepresents the war, CEO Linda Yaccarino said. Yaccarino released a statement in response to a warning from the European Commission that X could face penalties if it did not take action against "illegal content and disinformation" since Hamas' attack on Israel.
"There is no place on X for terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups and we continue to remove such accounts in real time," Yaccarino's statement said.
Gillian Kaye awoke Saturday to a nightmare: Her stepson was missing.
Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, was last seen by his family early that morning in Israel when Hamas destroyed his home as part of an unprecedented attack on Israeli towns near the border with Gaza. He lived at kibbutz Nir Oz with his wife, two daughters, and 400 others until it was decimated by the militant group, leaving only around 160 people alive and accounted for.
“This is so unfathomable,” said Kaye, a resident of Sarasota, Florida who was traveling when she learned of the assault.
Dekel-Chen, who holds dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship, is among an estimated 130 missing Israelis following the attacks.
According to his family, he sent his wife and children to the house’s bomb shelter while he confronted the attackers upstairs. Kaye and her family are urging Americans to write to their representatives in Congress to bolster search and rescue efforts. With no information about her stepson's whereabouts, Kaye said spreading the word is the only course of action.
“We do what needs to get done,” Kaye said. “And what needs to get done is to do everything possible to get Sagui home.”

Hamas has vowed to annihilate Israel and has been responsible for numerous suicide bombings and other deadly attacks since the militant group was formed in 1987. On Saturday, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea in an attack that caught Israel's military off-guard.
Hamas says Saturday's attack was partially a response to Israeli police activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The Jerusalem mosque is located on a holy site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. But Hamas leaders also blame unrelenting Israeli crackdowns and a 16-year blockade in Gaza and the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers illegal − and Israel's tight military control of Gaza.
Also, the attack came amid thawing relations between some Arab nations and Israel, the blood enemy of Hamas. The attack and Israel's harsh response could slow or derail those diplomatic overtures.
By land, sea, air and online:How Hamas used the internet to terrorize Israel
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.
Gaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian enclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.
Hamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.
The current war is a culmination of decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territory, which has been occupied since Israel was founded in 1948 and where Hamas rules the Gaza Strip. Jewish people and Muslims have some of their holiest sites in Jerusalem. Before Israel’s founding, the land was known as the Palestinian mandate, officially ruled by Great Britain. Prompted by the Holocaust, the UN United Nations adopted a resolution in 1947 that aimed to divide the Palestinian mandate into two states, Arab and Jewish.
War quickly broke out between Israel and its Arab neighbors, leading to Israeli expansion three-quarters of Palestinian mandate territory. Over half the Palestinian Arab population fled or was expelled, according to the U.N. Several conflicts between Israel and Arab states in the region followed over the next decades, and peace efforts that improved relations with other nations did not solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination. 
Israel captured the Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has since imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians there. These are all territories that had been sought by Palestinians for their future independent state. But Hamas rejects proposals for a two-state solution and believes in the eradication of Israel altogether through violent means. 
Palestinian uprisings, or intifadas, brought military clashes and protests against Israeli occupation and led to crackdowns by Israel’s military forces, and many were killed and injured on both sides.

A truck drove around Harvard University's campus on Wednesday displaying the names and faces of several students allegedly affiliated with student-groups that co-signed a letter blaming Israel for Hamas' attack.
The stunt claimed by the conservative media group Accuracy in Media comes after several CEOs have called on Harvard to release the names of students affiliated with groups tied to the controversial letter that solely blamed Israel for the attack.
The billboard called the students “Harvard leading antisemites.”
In a message on X, Hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman called for students to be named so he and other companies don't hire them.
“One should not be able to hide behind a corporate shield when issuing statements supporting the actions of terrorists,” Ackman wrote.

In a reply to Ackman, severalCEO's supported his call to name the students.
“I would like to know so I know never to hire these people,” Jonathan Neman, CEO of restaurant chain Sweetgreen said.
According to the Harvard Crimson, 34 Harvard student groups initially signed on to the statement originally written by the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee.
"The apartheid regime is the only one to blame," the statement read.
Following the national attention to the statement, the university distanced itself from the remarks.
"Let me also state, on this matter as on others, that while our students have the right to speak for themselves, no student group — not even 30 student groups — speaks for Harvard University or its leadership," Harvard President Claudine Gay said in a statement on Tuesday.
As of Wednesday, at least eight groups have removed their signatures amid a growing national backlash and the doxing, the Crimson reported. At least four sites have published the names and contact information of students
In a statement to students on Wednesday evening, Harvard Executive Vice President Meredith L. Weenick criticized online intimidation and harassment."
"I write tonight to assure you that the University takes seriously the safety and wellbeing of every member of our community. We do not condone or ignore intimidation. We do not condone or ignore threats or acts of harassment or violence," Weenick wrote.
Additionally, Weenick said the Harvard University Police Department will increase its presences on campus as a precautionary measure.
What’s happening in Israel?After Hamas attack, understanding the conflict in Gaza
Hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed, and thousands more have been injured on both sides since Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war after about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea in an attack that caught Israel's military off-guard.
"We are at war, and we will win it," Netanyahu said.
Israel then launched retaliatory military strikes into Gaza, levelling buildings. Israel has also tightened a blockade on food, fuel and medicines. Attacks have continued and the death toll on both sides keeps rising.
Executives at X say they are cracking down on misinformation and illegal content pervading the social media platform amid mounting pressure from the European Union in the days since the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel.
Hundreds of Hamas-linked accounts have been removed from the platform formerly known as Twitter, Linda Yaccarino, the company's CEO, claimed in a Thursday post on X. Additionally, Yaccarino claimed that thousands of pieces of content have been labeled or taken down since the war broke out around the contested land known as the Gaza Strip.
Yaccarino shared a letter on the platform in which she responded to a top European Union official who had demanded to know the steps X was taking to moderate the illicit posts, photos and videos flooding its platform showing the carnage.
"In response to the recent terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas, we've redistributed resources and refocused internal teams who are working around the clock to address this rapidly evolving situation," Yaccarino said.
Mapping Gaza:A look at the the 140-square-mile strip at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
Changes Elon Musk has put in place since he purchased Twitter and renamed it X have caused the platform to run afoul of the EU’s Digital Services Act.
Taking effect in August 2022, the law penalizes social media companies with hefty fines if it's found that illegal content like terrorist propaganda or hate speech are insufficiently policed.
Under Musk's leadership, X has carried out massive cuts to its content moderation teams and required that users pay to have a blue checkmark that once indicated a verified account. The changes have caused many experts and media observers to worry that Musk has made the platform more susceptible to misinformation.
And that was before decades of Israeli-Palestinian hostility was reignited.
Online hatred spreads:Israel, Gaza and when your social media posts hurt more than help
Exploiting lax content moderation on X and other sites, experts warn that Hamas has made online terror propaganda that includes violent videos and graphic images of kidnappings and murders of civilians and soldiers a key strategy in its military campaign.
Groups who study online hate speech say it has spiked against both Jews and Palestinians following the deadly attacks in Israel, where the death toll has already risen to the thousands on both sides of the fighting. Furthermore, representatives of both communities have told USA TODAY that they believe U.S.-based social media companies have not done enough to rid their platforms of violent rhetoric.
In the weeks before the conflict, the Anti-Defamation League had already been critical of X over what it believes are Musk’s alleged promotion of extremists on the site and his perceived laissez-faire approach to content moderation. 7amleh, an Arab civil rights organization, has also been attempting for months to persuade X to quell hate speech against Palestinians, USA TODAY has reported.
Trump blames Netanyahu:Former president calls Hamas 'very smart' amid Israel war
European Commissioner Thierry Breton, the 27-nation bloc’s digital enforcer, had sought an explanation from X for how the company was complying with the EU's strict digital rules as the Hamas Israel war rages.
“X is proportionately and effectively assessing and addressing identified fake and manipulated content during this constantly evolving and shifting crisis,” Yaccarino said in a letter to Breton dated Wednesday. "There is no place on X for terrorist organizations or extremist groups."
By land, sea, air and online:How Hamas used the internet to terrorize Israel
The social media platform said it assembled a leadership group shortly after news of the attack broke and Yaccarino said it has since responded to takedown requests from law enforcement agencies from around the world, including more than 80 from EU member states. As the war unfolds, Yaccarino said X has removed "hundreds of Hamas-affiliated accounts" and "tens of thousands of pieces of content" containing "violent speech, manipulated media and graphic" imagery from the conflict.
But some observers are skeptical of X's commitment to controlling the propaganda and depictions of violence flooding its platform.
A report from the Tech Transparency Project found several instances of “verified” X users, some with more than 500,000 followers, spreading uncensored Hamas propaganda videos. 
One clip viewed more than 60,000 times posted to X shows bodycam footage of Hamas militants going room-to-room in an Israeli military base firing automatic weapons as bloodied corpses lie on the ground.
“It's been nearly ten years since the Islamic State made heavy use of social media to amplify its propaganda and recruitment efforts. Although some platforms have improved at reducing the spread of Islamic State content, today we see Hamas deploying very similar tactics on X,” TTP director Katie A Paul told USA TODAY. “The company has monetized the spread of Hamas propaganda despite its clear violations of X policy. X needs to effectively enforce the rules it has on the books as the conflict continues.”

Inflation is headed in the right direction but the road remains bumpy.
Consumer price increases stayed high in September after picking up over the summer as steady gains in rent and other services offset another decline in used car prices and a smaller rise in gasoline and food costs.
Consumer prices overall rose 3.7% from a year earlier, similar to August's increase, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. 
On a monthly basis, prices increased 0.4% following a 0.6% rise in August that was fueled by a surge in pump prices.
Protect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023
Core prices, which strip out volatile food and energy items and which the Federal Reserve watches more closely as it weighs interest rate changes, remained high. They rose 0.3% last month after 0.2% bumps over the summer. The advance still lowered the annual increase to 4.1% from 4.3% in August, marking the smallest gain since September 2021.
Annual inflation has slowed significantly after hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, including a sharp drop to 3% in the first half of 2023. But since then, the cost of some goods and services has accelerated or pulled back more slowly, pushing up the yearly rise.
Prices for items such as used cars and furniture have dropped as pandemic-related supply-chain snarls have been resolved. But the cost of services such as rent, car repairs and auto insurance, have continued to drift higher in part because of briskly rising employee wages.
As a result, driving down inflation to the Fed’s annual 2% target is becoming a tougher slog. Barclays expects inflation broadly to dip to 3.3% in December and 2.6% at the end of 2024. Core price gains are projected to drift down to 3.7% at the end of the year and 2.8% at the close of 2024.
Barclays expects the Fed to raise its key interest rate once more this year, by a quarter percentage point, after lifting it by 5.25 points in 16 months.
But other economists say tumbling wholesale costs will prompt a faster pullback in inflation.
"Overall, there is nothing here that will convince Fed officials to hike rates at the next...meeting, and we continue to expect a more rapid decline in inflation and weaker economic growth to result in rates being cut much more aggressively next year than markets are pricing in," says economist Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics.
Stocks were mixed in late morning trading as investors digested the uncertain odds of another Fed rate increase. The Dow Jones industrial average was down about 70 points, or 0.21% while the S&P 500 index was up 2 points or 0.05%.
Households, meanwhile, are still struggling. Although price increases are moderating, costs are still high and many Americans say they aren’t feeling much relief. 
Stanley Novack, 78, of Valencia, California, says he’s most frustrated by high gas and grocery costs. “It’s out there, wherever you go,” says Novack, who is semi-retired and works part-time as a hotel and restaurant consultant. “We’re not seeing it easing at all.”
He says he pays $6.50 a gallon for gas in California and as much as $135 for weekly groceries for him and his wife, up from $100 before the pandemic. “You just have to deal with it,” he says.
Gasoline prices rose 2.1% in September after surging 10.6% the previous month and they’re up 3% from a year earlier. Pump prices are well below their $5 peak in summer 2022 and are likely move lower in the short term following the busy summer driving season despite the Israel-Hamas war, which has pushed up oil prices.
Grocery prices rose more modestly, inching up 0.1% and lowering the yearly increase to 2.4%. The cost of commodities such as wheat and corn generally have fallen as major producers Ukraine and Russia have found alternative shipping routes that skirt their 18-month war.
Last month, the price of breakfast cereal fell 0.5%, while rice and fish both slid 1.3%.
But some proteins moved higher. Bacon rose 4.8% following a 4% rise in August; uncooked ground beef increased 0.6%; and eggs jumped 0.9% after a string of declines.
Rent, which has been the biggest inflation driver, rose a sturdy 0.5% for the second straight month, though that’s down from a spate of stronger gains. That nudged up the yearly rise to 7.4%. Economists expect rent increases to pull back, based on new leases, but that shift has been slow to filter through to existing leases.
Generally, the pattern of rising service costs fueled by healthy wage growth and falling goods prices continued last month.
Car repair costs rose 0.2%; auto insurance climbed 1.3%; and hotel rates leaped 3.7%. A key measure of service costs, excluding housing, that the Fed is following closely jumped 0.6%, says Nationwide economist Kathy Bostjancic
Meanwhile, used car prices fell 2.5%; clothing dropped 0.8%; and furniture declined 1.2% as supply chain troubles eased further.
USA TODAY explores the questions you and others ask about inflation and how it affects your life, from "What is inflation?" to "What happens during a recession?" For more answers to your questions about today's report and other economic trends, keep reading:
Social Security recipients will get 3.2% more in their checks next year, a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, based on Thursday's consumer price report showing that annual overall inflation remained at the same level as the previous month.
The 3.7% rise in overall prices is nearly twice the 2% target favored by the Federal Reserve. But inflation has been mostly trending down, leading to the modest Social Security COLA increase.
Major differences, according to the Cleveland Fed, are:
The Fed raised its key rate at 10 meetings in a row starting in March 2022, the most aggressive run of rate hikes in four decades. It paused that streak in June, leaving the benchmark federal funds rate where it stood, but implemented another increase the following month lifting the rate by a quarter point to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. 
The federal funds rate is what banks pay each other for overnight loans. If that rate rises, banks typically pass along that extra cost, meaning it becomes more expensive to borrow as rates increase on services and items ranging from credit cards to home equity lines. That’s why the funds rate is the primary tool used by the Federal Reserve to try and put the brakes on inflation.  
When it costs more to borrow, businesses and consumers are less inclined to do it, and that means an overheated economy can cool and price increases may slow. 
The Fed’s policy arm meets next on Oct. 31-Nov. 1. It will announce its interest rate decision at 2 P.M. ET on Nov. 1.
The Fed’s final meeting of the year is Dec. 12-13.
The inflation rate has plunged, tumbling by more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June, 2022. But it’s still above the 2% target preferred by the Federal Reserve. Here's where the U.S. inflation rate has stood each month since May 2022:
The Federal Reserve watches two key measures of the economy, price stability and maximum employment, which are its main considerations in interest-rate decisions.  The CPI gives the Fed guidance to assess whether prices are “stable.’’
CPI is also used to inflation-adjust things like Social Security payments and income tax brackets. It’s also the reference rate for some financial contracts, such as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). 
Core prices leave out volatile food and energy items and therefore are a more accurate reflection of longer-term trends.
September used car prices likely fell at least 2% from the prior month, while energy prices recorded a modest increase of 0.4% after a 5.6% jump in August, said Stephen Juneau, U.S. economist at Bank of America. Retail gasoline prices, he said, were nearly flat last month.
Goldman Sachs economists forecast a 2.3% decline in used car prices and a 0.1% dip in new car prices last month.
Renters are still getting squeezed. Goldman Sachs economists see rents up 0.48% on the month, rising at about a steady pace. Shelter inflation, which includes home prices, rents and other lodging, comprises about a third of the consumer price index (CPI). However, Goldman says 
Airfares are also expected to post a gain, some economists noted. 
It depends on the data.
The CME Fed watch tool that helps gauge the market’s expectation for a rate move puts the chances of a Fed rate hike at only 10%, but economists aren’t yet fully ruling one out, partly because the labor market remains strong. A strong job market puts money in people’s pockets, which can fuel spending and inflation.
“With the surprisingly-strong September job report intensifying the debate on the further hikes, the near-term policy trajectory will be highly sensitive to Thursday’s CPI,” Deutsche Bank economists said in a note.
The last time the Fed met in September, it held rates steady at a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% but signaled another hike is likely this year amid still elevated inflation and a sturdy economy.
“Broadly, stronger economic activity means we have to do more with rates,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters then. 
He also said, separately, “we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.”
CPI measures inflation as experienced by consumers going about their day-to-day lives, while the PPI, or producer price index, measures the average changes over time in the sale prices received by domestic producers for their output. PPI, often referred to as wholesale price inflation, is gleaned during an  earlier phase of the production and marketing cycle and typically impacts CPI. 
Core inflation, which assesses inflation but leaves out the more volatile prices of food and energy, is the other key price metric.  
In bonds, the 10-year Treasury yield, which tends to rise if inflation accelerates, was 4.64%, up a modest 0.046 points.
Social Security recipients found out Thursday how much of a raise they will get next year. That’s because the consumer price index report contains data the Social Security Administration (SSA) uses to determine the cost-of-living adjustment or COLA for 2024. 
Those payments will go up 3.2%. 
The annual overall inflation rate is currently 3.7%, but is expected to have slid by a tenth of a point in September.  
Inflation is a "generalized rise in prices," according to Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C. The cost of items and services ranging from health care, to gas, to groceries can shift depending on inflation.  
When there are too few goods to meet the demand, prices are likely to rise, according to Investopedia. That disparity is called demand pull inflation. 
The Department of Labor has a tool that enables consumers to find out shifts in their buying power.   
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) looks at the average change in prices for particular products and services over a period of time, according to the Bureau of Labor Services.
It’s one inflation measure that the Fed and the economist use as a barometer to gauge price stability. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or PCE, prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The next PCE report for September is due Oct. 27.

Wages vs. inflation:US wage growth is finally outpacing inflation. Many Americans aren't feeling it.
After suspending a Black student over his dreadlocks, a Texas high school sent a notice to his family saying the student will be sent to a disciplinary education program, according to a letter reviewed by the Associated Press.
Darryl George, 18, was referred to EPIC, an alternative school program, from Oct. 12 through Nov. 29 for "failure to comply" with multiple campus and classroom regulations, including a "violation of the dress and grooming policy," read the letter signed by Lance Murphy, the principal of Barbers Hill High School.
Murphy wrote that George can return to the classroom on Nov. 30. His family cannot appeal the decision because the alternative school referral was not for a period longer than 60 days, according to the Texas Education Code cited in the letter.
The school district did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.
On Aug. 31, George, a junior at Barbers Hill High School, was suspended after school officials said his twisted dreadlocks violated the district's dress and grooming code. Although the district's policy does not prohibit dreadlocks or braids, it states that male student's hair cannot "be gathered or worn in a style that would allow the hair to extend below the top of a t-shirt collar, below the eyebrows, or below the ear lobes when let down."
But George's mother, Darresha George, and Allie Booker, the family's attorney, have denied that the teenager's hairstyle violates the district's policy.
Last month the family filed a formal complaint with the Texas Education Agency and a federal civil rights lawsuit against the state’s governor and attorney general, alleging they failed to enforce a new law outlawing discrimination based on hairstyles.
George has twisted dreadlocks tied on top of his head that he wears as an "outward expression of his Black identity and culture," according to the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas.
The lawsuit and supporters of George allege that his ongoing suspension is a violation of Texas' CROWN Act, a new law that is intended to prohibit "discrimination on the basis of hair texture or protective hairstyle associated with race," according to state Rep. Rhetta Andrews Bowers, D-Rowlett, who authored the bill.
The suit also alleges that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton have failed to enforce the CROWN Act, which went into effect on Sept. 1 – a day after George was suspended. The lawsuit alleges that the state leaders did not protect George's constitutional and state rights, and allowed the school district to violate the law.
On Wednesday, an attorney representing the Barbers Hill Independent School District filed a motion asking the judge to send the case back to state court, arguing that "No federal claims were raised" in the lawsuit by George's family, according to court records.
The following day, Judge George C. Hanks Jr. of the U.S. District Court in Houston denied the motion because it did not comply with court procedures, records said.
The attorneys for the George family and school district did not reply to requests for comment.
Barbers Hill High School has previously clashed with two other Black male students over the dress code.
Barbers Hill officials told cousins De’Andre Arnold and Kaden Bradford they had to cut their dreadlocks in 2020. Their families sued the district in May 2020, and a federal judge later ruled the district’s hair policy was discriminatory. Their pending case helped spur Texas lawmakers to approve the state’s CROWN Act. Both students withdrew from the school but Bradford returned after the judge’s ruling.

WASHINGTON — Words carry weight. They provide context amid chaos, solace amid uncertainty, hope amid horror. But what if you couldn't read? How much of the world might you miss?
Authors and other members of the literary community – including first lady Jill Biden – gathered Wednesday night at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for the Barbara Bush Foundation’s 2023 National Celebration of Reading. The night featured authors like Rebecca Yarros ("Fourth Wing"), Cheryl Strayed ("Wild") and Steven Rowley ("The Guncle"), and moving moments from those whose journeys to literacy haven't been as easy as flipping a page.
One such person was Oliver James, who gained hundreds of thousands of TikTok followers on his journey of learning to read in his 30s. At the event, he read a short statement from a teleprompter – which singer Franc D'Ambrosio, who is dyslexic, referred to as a Cirque du Soleil feat – and captivated the audience with illuminating thoughts on the power of reading.
"It's hard to tell (someone) that they don't know things," James said. "But when I wasn't reading, I thought I knew everything. And then I started learning how to read and found out I knew nothing."
To put it in context: 130 million American adults read below a sixth-grade level – that's 54% of 16- to 74-year-olds.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
It's why – especially given our polarizing political climate – reading is more fundamental than ever.
"Reading forces us to challenge our preconceived notions, question our underlying assumptions and wrestle with uncomfortable truths," the first lady said before a rapt room at the Terrace Theater. "Few skills are as crucial in democracy that owes its endurance to engage and inform citizens."
Yarros started writing her books back more than a decade ago during her husband's third deployment to Afghanistan – one page in the middle of the night.
Now, Yarros has written more than 15 novels – one of which, fantasy novel "Fourth Wing," is enjoying a high spot on USA TODAY's Best-selling Booklist. The "Fourth Wing" sequel, "Iron Flame," is out in a few weeks.
"Fantasy gives us an opportunity to examine our own culture by creating a different one, and to make remarks in our own society through fantastical adventure," Yarros told USA TODAY in an interview before the event.
The accomplished author, mother of six and military spouse championed literacy in remarks at the event: "I've been raised by military parents who never want censored what I read as I grew up," she said. "They believed that knowing both sides of an argument made you better informed, better prepared to form your own opinion, or defend your point at the dinner table, and the only truly unacceptable opinion was ignorance."
She later denounced book bans. "As an author, I can't comprehend why we would ban books, shown to increase students' empathy and understanding of the world around them, simply because those novels don't align with a particular viewpoint," she said. "And I definitely can't understand the attacks on books that represent marginalized readers."
Yarros also told USA TODAY: "I wish more parents would take the opportunity to talk to their kids about what they're reading instead of banning the books, that they took the time to read them and discuss them with their kids instead of simply saying you can't."

Strayed learned how to read at 6 years old. Her world would never be the same: "I learned the power of literature is that we get to see ourselves most truly, we get to see others in the world in ways that we could never conjure or imagine left to our own devices," she said. "We get to understand that people who seem different from us, actually are the same as us."
Strayed also told USA TODAY that she loves all kinds of art forms – but something about literature hits differently.
"It's the only art form that honestly allows you to mind meld with somebody else," she said. "Like you get to be inside my mind. What was I thinking when my toenails were falling off? What was I telling myself when I was afraid, and I had to say to myself, 'I am not afraid,' as I wrote in 'Wild?' There's something very intimate about that."
Rowley, author of "The Celebrants" (and forthcoming "Guncle" sequel "The Guncle Abroad") told USA TODAY that acquiring books is particularly important for queer youth. "For young queer kids, like sometimes they're very on their own, and they don't have the support or don't feel yet that they can trust that they have the support of their parents," Rowley said. "Being able to have access to these stories and not have them kept from them is incredibly important."
"The Mamas" author Helena Andrews-Dyer discussed the importance of diversity in storytelling in her prepared speech that touched on racism and classism: "We talk about books being windows to the world, and they are, but they have to be mirrors too. I repeat, books are mirrors. And those mirrors are why I write, to see and to be seen."
The night closed with a few songs courtesy of famed "Phantom of the Opera" D'Ambrosio, including a haunting medley from the musical. One couldn't help but feel these lyrics linger: "Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams / Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before / Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar / And you'll live as you've never lived before."

We all have to face the prospect of aging at some point. We prepare for this reality for years in advance, starting 401ks, contributing to Medicare and Social Security as well as comparing insurance plans.
For many Americans, the goal is to have ample healthcare, a nest egg to retire on and the ability to age peacefully at home.
According to a new survey conducted between January and February of 2022, however, these goals are not being equally obtained by all. Conducted with 2,227 random Americans aged 50 to 80 online or via phone, the survey found that Black citizens were less likely to achieve aging in place.
This is thanks to a variety of factors, with the two most significant being self-reported disability status and income.
Social security changes:Why October 12 is a big day for Social Security recipients
Led by Sheria Robinson-Lane, assistant professor in the department of systems, populations and leadership with the University of Michigan's School of Nursing in Ann Arbor, the study published Oct. 4 in journal Geriatric Nursing found that nearly one third of adults aged 50–80 (30.9%) reported currently living with a disability.
Black adults experienced the highest rate of disability at 40% as well as higher rates of "fair" or "poor" physical health at 37.1% versus 20.9% overall.
Black households were also more likely to report having a family member with a disability present with 36.4% compared to the overall sample of 23.3%. Half of Black households also reported an income lower than $30,000 a year, a significant discrepancy from the quarter of overall respondents who reported the same thing (23.3%).
Older Black Americans are also more likely to live alone, with 44.1% reporting they were the only one in their home versus a quarter of overall respondents. This, paired with the aforementioned factors, cumulate in Black adults having lower rates of confidence in their ability to afford and find necessary in-home care.
How does all of this prevent Black Americans from aging at home? First and foremost, said the study's authors, increased rates of disability mean more strain on already thinly stretched resources.
Older adults with disabilities often require some form of assistive device, human support or other accommodations. The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services' Administration on Aging found that on average, 70% of people 65 and up need some type of long-term care, such as a nursing home or assisted living, at some point, while 20% will need that care for more than five years.
Women face microaggressions at work:We need to talk about the macro effect of microaggressions on women at work
With assisted living costs averaging at $4,500 per month and nursing homes averaging $7,908-$9,034 per month for a semi-private room or private room according to Genworth Financial's 2021 Cost of Care Survey, support for older people is in no way cheap.
In-home care is pricey as well, with median prices hovering between $4,957 to $5,148 per month for homemaker services or a home health aide, according to the same 2021 data. In the same year, more than half of Americans had less than $250 left at the end of the month after paying necessary bills.
With older Black Americans more likely to shoulder the weight of higher healthcare costs due to disability, more likely to live alone without in-home familial assistance and more likely to grapple with an income under $30,000, they face multiple barriers to aging in their own home and communities.
Within the overall sample, 41.3% of respondents were not confident they could afford supportive care such as assistance with chores, shopping, personal care or finance management if needed. Facing down the existing cost-of-living crisis, many older Americans have found themselves without means to live comfortably or access necessary resources.
In an already difficult fiscal climate, ethnic and racial discrepancies continue to impact quality of care for our older population. According to the study's authors, healthcare facilities placing a focus on adapting and optimizing care to close these gaps is an important course of action to begin addressing the disparity.
"Aging in place requires a proactive individual and community-based approach that facilitates older adult independence and connects adults with the social, clinical, and environmental support needed to remain in one's home for as long as possible," the study said.
The movie "Snakes on a Plane" dramatized perhaps the worst things to encounter on a flight, but imagine being stuck on a real-world plane with a swarm of mosquitos.
It happened to a local flight in Mexico, which was delayed for more than two hours from its scheduled departure time of 4:30 p.m., due to a mosquito infestation, local media reported. Cabin crew and ground staff tried to get the situation under control by spraying mosquito and insect repellent in the cabins. It eventually took off at 6:59 p.m., according to the flight's history.
The flight, VOI221 operated by Volaris Airlines, was traveling within Mexico from Guadalajara to Mexico City on Friday, October 6, according to Storyful.

Video footage from the incident, recorded by a passenger, shows the airplane's cabin filled with fumes as flight attendants spray insect repellent to counteract the swarm of mosquitoes buzzing around the cabin. The flight appeared to be ready for takeoff, with all passengers seated. Some of them could be heard screaming in the video, while others swatted the insects away.
As the airlines staff sprayed the mosquito repellent, the insects became more agitated reported the local media outlet El Sol de León.
They did not settle down until all the lights were turned off, a passenger told Storyful.
This is not the first time that a swarm of mosquitos attacked a flight taking off from the Guadalajara International Airport. A similar incident took place in 2019. El Sol de León said that the area in which the airport is located is close to contaminated water bodies and vegetation, both of which are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Favorable weather conditions also contribute to increasing mosquito populations.
Airport authorities have recognized this as a problem, reported El Sol de León, and have taken steps such as draining water, pruning grass and spraying insecticides to curb the problem.
Volaris Airlines did not immediately respond to USA TODAY'S request for a comment.

Strong storms are moving across central Florida Thursday morning, producing at least two tornados in the area and keeping residents on high alert.
The National Weather Service had issued a multitude of tornado warnings and watches across the state as the low-pressure system moved through and caused damage along a major highway in Crystal River, about 80 miles north of Tampa.
The Citrus County Sheriff's Office posted an alert on X, formerly known as Twitter, about damages the tornado caused along the highway with debris, shingles and fences sprawled across the road and the city.
About two hours south in Clearwater, no injuries were reported related to the storm, police said. The National Weather Service of Tampa Bay Meteorologist Stephen Shiveley confirmed at least one tornado touched down in Clearwater at around 2 a.m., around the same time another one was spotted in Crystal River.
Shiveley told USA TODAY the office is surveying the area to confirm if a second tornado hit Clearwater or if the first traveled to another area.
A possible tornado was reported in Palm Coast, along Florida's Atlantic coast, causing damage to residences and vehicles, according to photos shared with the Daytona Beach News-Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network. Scott Cordero, a NWS meteorologist in Jacksonville, said a team is also surveying the damage there and referring to radar data to determine if a tornado occurred. He added the determination could take a few hours as most of the state is under a tornado watch until 3 p.m. Thursday, with severe weather still threatening the area until then.
"We still do have a tornado watch going for about five hours. The atmosphere is probably a little less conducive and since we had spinners, we extended the watch all the way through mid-afternoon," Cordero said.
No injuries have been reported at this time, although "there is some significant damage in the area."
The National Weather Service also issued tornado warnings for Flagler and Citrus counties Thursday. Tornado watches are active throughout central to northern Florida.

First it was "Barbenheimer" season. Now, it's officially the "Renaissance Era."
In a show of legendary pop stars supporting one another, Beyoncé appeared as a guest at the world premiere of Taylor Swift's concert film "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour" in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
Swift, 33, wore that red lip, classic thing her fans like (IYKYK!) and a blue, quilted Oscar de la Renta ballgown fit for the star of the night. Beyoncé, 42, posed alongside the "Lavender Haze" singer, wearing a chrome breastplate over a black bodysuit, in true Renaissance fashion.
The "Karma" singer shared a Boomerang video with the "Virgo's Groove" singer on Instagram as they enjoyed each other's company over a tub of popcorn.
"I'm so glad I’ll never know what my life would’ve been like without @beyonce‘s influence," Swift captioned the post. "The way she's taught me and every artist out here to break rules and defy industry norms."
The 33-year-old pop star continued to praise her peer for "her generosity of spirit" and "her resilience and versatility."
"She's been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale," Swift concluded.
The multi-Grammy award winners each headlined two of the biggest tours of the year, both of which are getting the concert movie treatment.
Both Swifties and the Beyhive have been in a race to score tickets for "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour" and "Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé," the former of which premiered today and latter hitting theaters on Dec. 1.
It's unclear when Beyoncé plans to have her concert film premiere, but we can only guess Swift will be a guest.
Fans enthralled by the Eras concert will undoubtedly thrill at the opportunity to relive the magic and enjoy "The Eras Tour" as a communal concert experience more than a staid movie, USA TODAY's music critic Melissa Ruggieri says.
Taylor Swift 'Eras' movie review:Concert film a thrilling revisit of her live spectacle
At just under three hours, the film version of Swift's live spectacle is about 30 minutes shorter than her in-person performances throughout her six-month U.S. tour (her overseas dates kick off in November).
Her live shows offered a set list of 45 songs – once she added "Long Live" to the rundown in July – and the film, directed by Sam Wrench, shaves off only a handful of tunes for a more efficient run time.

The UAW strike against the Ford Kentucky Truck Plant is a signal that hourly workers are willing to inflict − and sustain − increasingly serious financial pain to achieve their goals during labor negotiations, as the union and the Detroit Three approach a full month without resolution.
The financial impact of the surprise strike called Wednesday night was swift and immediate.
As the news that Mary Lou Retton is “fighting for her life” swept across social media Tuesday, sending tens of thousands to rally virtually to her side, there was an undeniable and uplifting sense that we had all been here before. 
Of course we had. This is Mary Lou Retton, and this is us, and there’s something very reassuring in knowing that this nation loves her just as much today as it did nearly 40 years ago, when an ever-smiling 16-year-old tomboy, a tiny fullback in a gymnast’s leotard, barreled toward the vault at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, flew into the air and landed in every American living room. 
Forty years of adoration is a lot of years and a lot of love. I have been fortunate to witness it all as a journalist, to interview and catch up with Mary Lou on the phone, at social events, at subsequent Olympics. But it all goes back to those early days in 1984, summed up so succinctly and presciently by a copy of Sports Illustrated I pulled out of a cabinet Wednesday morning, one of my many mementos from the L.A. Olympics, which were my first.
On the cover of the August 13, 1984 issue is a photo of a jubilant young athlete in red, white and blue, fists clenched, arms raised in triumph, with the headline: “Only you, Mary Lou!”
She was lovable from the get-go. We actually met before the L.A. Games. I looked it up in my diary: it was June 3, 1984, the morning after she qualified for the U.S. Olympic team at the gymnastics trials in Jacksonville. I was with the Miami Herald then, and photographer Bill Frakes and I drove to the motel where Mary Lou and her family were staying. The press availability that we were expecting ended up being a family affair: just Bill, me and the Rettons, all sitting on chaise lounges by the pool in Florida, far from their Fairmont, West Virginia, home.
Mary Lou told me she wished she was taller. She was 4-9. “I wish I was 5 feet tall,” she said. “That would be perfect.” 
Her parents used to tell her they were going to give her hormone shots to help her grow but never did. So short jokes became a big part of her young life. Her favorite: “Stand up, Mary Lou,” when she already was. 
Her father, Ronnie, a veritable giant at 5-7, was an athlete as well. He was the sixth man, a guard, on the West Virginia men’s basketball team that was led by Hall of Famer Jerry West.
Mary Lou was a natural athlete who was unstoppable inside the house. Her mother, Lois, said she finally put Mary Lou into a gymnastics class when far too many lamps were overturned.
“I was a tomboy,” Mary Lou told me. “I looked like a little boy. I even ran around topless.”
She said all this with a smile. Everything about this teenager, unknown to me until that week, screamed out fun, joy, happiness. Bill had an idea for a photo and asked if anyone had any bubble gum. I actually did, so I handed it to Mary Lou, who started chewing and then blew a massive pink bubble that covered her entire face. This made quite a picture, with her grandmother standing beside her, looking on with a wry smile, both of them in bathing suits. 
That day by the pool, the Rettons had no idea what was waiting for their daughter, but whatever it was, there was some trepidation about it. 
“I worry about her,” Lois Retton said. “I worry when she travels, about the security when she performs. She’s 16. She should be going to proms and ball games. I feel like I’ve lost her to the world. Will she ever come back?”
She did, just much more famous. Mary Lou of course became the darling of those Olympics, a household name, a role model for several generations of young female athletes — and someone I would seek for perspective when writing about little girls in big-time sports.
She has one of my favorite quotes on the subject:
“While other kids were reading about the Great Wall, I was walking on it.”
It’s worth remembering exactly what happened at those 1984 Olympics. With a perfect 10 on the vault at UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion, Retton became the first American to win the women’s individual all-around gold medal, one of the most coveted titles in all of sports. She won five medals altogether in L.A., including silvers in the team competition and on the vault, and bronze medals on the uneven bars and floor exercise. Considering that no American woman had ever won an individual Olympic gymnastics medal of any color, she was a revelation.
She also knew luck was on her side. The strong Soviet gymnasts, including the reigning women’s individual all-around world champion, were not in L.A., having boycotted those Games. But the highly-regarded Romanians did compete in L.A., and, as Retton said, “It was a big battle. I earned my medal.”
What happened next was a dream. She was everywhere, from the front of the Wheaties box to SI’s Sportswoman of the Year. She appeared on gymnastics tours, on TV shows and in the movies. She has been a constant presence at the Olympic Games and is one of the most sought-after speakers and celebrities in the U.S. Olympic movement. 
She also has four daughters, all of whom have been involved in gymnastics. She got a kick out of relating how she tried to remain anonymous when taking one of her daughters to a gymnastics class. That didn’t last long. 
“They knew it was me,” she said with a hearty laugh.
In the same week that the sports world continues to celebrate the greatness of Simone Biles, there’s now an outpouring of concern over the woman who started it all. 
“As the first U.S. all-around Olympic gymnastics champion, Mary Lou Retton became a shining icon of American excellence,” veteran sports agent Sheryl Shade texted Wednesday. “Her legacy is important, as her performance and personality inspired millions of girls (and parents) to swell the ranks of women’s gymnastics in the USA. Many of my gymnast clients had her poster in their rooms and on their vision boards even though she competed years before they were born.”
Who are some of those clients? Laurie Hernandez, Shawn Johnson, Shannon Miller, Amanda Borden, Jaycie Phelps and Gabby Douglas, Olympic stars all.
That Sports Illustrated cover had it right all those years ago. Mary Lou, it has always been only you. 
The judge in Donald Trump's criminal case alleging that classified documents were mishandled will weigh on Thursday whether lawyers for two co-defendants are too close to witnesses.
U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon will consider arguments related to witnesses expected to testify about the co-defendants moving boxes and trying to delete surveillance video at Mar-a-Lago. The testimony is part of the evidence against Trump and his co-defendants for allegedly retaining and hiding national security records after he left the White House.
Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith warned Cannon that lawyers representing Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, two staffers at Mar-a-Lago where the FBI seized the classified documents, might have conflicts.
Stanley Woodward represents Nauta, Trump’s personal valet. John Irving represents De Oliveira, the property manager at Mar-a-Lago. Woodward and Irving also represented several witnesses in the case.
Woodward told prosecutors he had no conflicts. Donnie Murrell, another lawyer for De Oliveira, said there was no conflict with witnesses and that even if there was, Murrell could cross-examine them rather than Irving.
Trump is charged with unlawful retention of national defense information. He is charged with Nauta and De Oliveira with obstruction of justice. All three have pleaded not guilty.
Here is a summary of potential conflicts prosecutors raised:
Woodward represented seven other people questioned during the investigation, including three likely witnesses at trial, prosecutors said.
Irving represented four other people questioned during the investigation, including three potential witnesses at trial, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors argued there could be two types of conflicts. One is that a lawyer could disclose confidences from his client during cross-examination of a witness. Another is that the attorney might “pull his punches” during cross-examination to protect his client's confidences or because of his personal interests.
In De Oliveira’s case, according to prosecutors:
Murrell, De Oliveira's lawyer, said in a court filing that Irving no longer represents the three witnesses and that he has no confidential information about those witnesses that could be a conflict in cross-examination.
"Here, the Government seeks a hearing based on only what it believes is a potential for a conflict, and not any actual conflict," Murrell wrote.
In Nauta's case, some of the rationale that explained why each witness could face a conflict was filed in confidential documents. According to prosecutors:
"All three may be witnesses for the Government at trial, raising the possibility that Mr. Woodward might be in the position of cross-examining past or current clients,” prosecutors wrote for Smith. The director of information technology changed lawyers before the grand jury handed up the indictment.
Woodward told prosecutors that he notified his various clients about potential conflicts, but doesn’t think there are any. Woodward said in a filing that he played no role in the grand jury testimony from Taveras, and the witness testified he "wasn't coached."
Cannon set the hearings at 1 p.m. for De Oliveira and 3 p.m. for Nauta.
LOS ANGELES – There are movie premieres here where the red carpet is the star event.
But this is Taylor's version.
The world premiere of Taylor Swift's "Eras Tour" movie on Wednesday night was all about what was inside a very common AMC movie theater in an outdoor mall that was closed for the day. And Taylor Swift herself, sitting in theater No. 2, seat F8, at the center, next to her tour backup singers and dancers, and actress Julia Garner.
"Hi, so you're stuck with me because I'm going to, like, sit with you and watch this thing," Swift said, dressed in a strapless light blue Oscar de la Renta high-low gown before the movie began. "But before we do that, I want to say thank you for wanting to spend your evening with me. ... I've always had fun doing this. I can't believe music is my career; that's crazy to me. I've always loved it. I've never had a fraction of the amount of fun I've had on the Eras tour before, ever."
The theater was filled with fans – some of whom her team invited via direct message on X, formerly Twitter – and celebrity Swifties including Simu Liu, Maren Morris and Adam Sandler and his wife and two daughters, as well as Swift's own camera crew.
Taylor Swift 'Eras' movie review:Concert film a thrilling revisit of her live spectacle
Swift visited each theater to thank guests before coming to the spot where she would watch her movie.
"I want to say, I have friends in this room, I have my amazing backing vocalists in this room. ... We pranced on that stage grinning because of what met us on the other side and that was you, how much you cared about it. That was absolutely everything," she said. "So, I think you will see that you absolutely are main characters in this film because that's what made the tour magical, that's what made the tour different from anything I've ever done in my life."
She continued: "Your attention to detail, your preparation, your passion, your intensity, you cared so much about these shows and that made all the difference for us. It made us want to add even more shows. I just have never felt this way about anything. I am so proud."
Just before the movie started at 8:30 p.m., she said: "I think I will just watch it with you now. So let's have a blast, guys. Thank you for coming."
Guests ate popcorn out of commemorative Eras Tour tins and Reese's Pieces and Red Vines from a complimentary elaborate candy bar decorated with fresh flowers flown in that morning for the display. An AMC employee stopped by Swift's seat and poured glasses of white wine.
The movie replicated Swift's popular and sold-out concerts, with an intimacy few felt in the stadium tour. The movie was like a close-up and clearer version of a stadium Jumbotron, with details from Swift's ballerina flats to her multicolored fingernails featured.
Moviegoers at the premiere captured the concert feel with sequined jackets, sparkly boots, pastel pouf dresses and friendship bracelets.
'Eras' tour movie etiquette:How to enjoy the Taylor Swift concert film (the right way)
Throughout the movie, Swift bopped her head with the songs, pumped her arms, mimicked her onscreen dance moves and smiled almost nonstop. Watching her was as fun as watching the movie.
It was also a movie where participation felt almost mandatory.
"It's so wild. Watching her is making this so much fun," said Arianna Trinidad, a Swiftie from Phoenix who attended the world premiere of the concert tour, and was at the theater for the movie's world premiere. "I can't believe I'm here, two rows behind her. I think we're both having the same amount of fun."
As the screen showed "Look What You Made Me Do" from the "Reputation" era, Sandler - sitting just behind Swift in his trademark Hawaiian polo shirt – bounced in his chair and clapped, one of Swift's vocalists held her hands up in the shape of a heart, and Swift vibed to the beat.
Before the movie began, Swift took photos with fans and made a video with Beyoncé in an empty theater. She posted on her Instagram: "She's been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale."
It was unclear if Beyoncé, who opens her own movie "Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé" with AMC in December, stayed to watch the movie. She was not in the theater with Swift.
While Swift's appearance at the movie was expected, most people in theater No. 2 hadn't expected to watch the movie with her. Their eyes gazed from the screen to Swift, while they joined her in singing everything from "Cruel Summer" to "Midnight Rain."
By the end of the two-hour and 48 minute movie, the crowd was standing and dancing to its final song, "Karma." Swift took selfies – with a flash – with her dancers, singers and Garner.
The credits included cute outtakes from the tour – and some names spelled out in friendship bracelet style. After the movie, Swift took photos with fans and posed while Sandler snapped a photo of her with his daughters before she slipped out a door at the back of the theater.
The movie was scheduled to open on Friday. But after selling more than $100 million in presale tickets and leaving many people waiting in online queues to buy movie tickets, it now will open on Thursday.
Editor's note: Part one of a five-part USA TODAY series revealing why America hasn't solved its long struggle with Type 2 diabetes.
For chef Robin Ray, newly married with young stepchildren, the turning point came when a stabbing chest pain sent her rushing to the emergency room. 
For Brian Castrucci, the gravity hit when the ER doc who had treated him for a near-heart attack a few weeks earlier gave him a big bear hug. “I didn’t think you’d make it,” the doctor said.
The crisis unspooled more slowly for James Haynes but started in 2019 when he stepped on a rusty nail and didn’t notice. 
The moments were turning points for all three to get serious about addressing their diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can’t properly regulate blood sugar, has become so common it’s almost considered inconsequential. More than 1 in 10 Americans have the disease (though many don't know) and another nearly 4 in 10 are at risk for it. In total, half of all adults and a quarter of teenagers have diabetes or pre-diabetes.
Its financial costs are astronomical. The country spends more than $300 billion a year to address diabetes, accounting for $1 out of every $4 spent on health care. 
And its personal tolls are even worse: heart attacks, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, double the risk of premature death. It also causes what’s known as “diabetes distress,” the daily burdens and emotional toll of living with and managing a chronic ailment that can lead to regular dips in energy, foggy thinking and depression, and a sense of isolation.
The most frustrating aspect of Type 2 diabetes, experts say, is that it has long been largely preventable and controllable. 
“We have made tremendous gains in understanding diabetes,” said Dr. Donald Berwick, a pediatrician and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “The best diabetes care can make a very big difference. You can’t say we don’t know what to do.”
And yet, diagnosed rates of Type 2 diabetes have soared over the past 25 years, and especially over the past dozen – particularly among working-age adults like Ray, Castrucci and Haynes. 
Roughly 40% of people who died early in the coronavirus pandemic had Type 2 diabetes, a rate four times higher than people without the disease. Even when elevated blood sugar levels are below the threshold for type 2 diabetes, the risk for heart disease jumps 30% to 50% compared with people with normal blood sugar levels. (Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 5% to 10% of diabetes, is caused by the immune system and is unrelated to diet or lifestyle.)
America’s failure to address Type 2 diabetes highlights larger problems with our food and medical systems, Berwick and other experts said.
A soda costs less than a bottle of water, a double cheeseburger and fries less than a carton of blueberries. Patients wait months for medical appointments only to see the back of a white coat for the short time they’re allotted. Treating disease costs society far more than preventing it but typically provides more profit for insurance companies, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry.
The USA TODAY Health team spoke with scores of health care providers, researchers, community leaders and patients for this five-part series to understand why Type 2 diabetes continues to worsen in America despite known solutions.
The answer isn't simple. It involves systemic problems facing everyone in society, not just those with diabetes: a food system designed to sell products; a medical system in which cutting off a leg is less expensive than saving it; the high cost of healthy living and the fact that breaking habits takes a lot more than just personal willpower.
This first story looks at what it takes for people to cope with or overcome the disease.
Then, we explore one community in a David vs. Goliath battle against a food system that fails to prioritize people's health.

Finally, we explore solutions, addressing why it will take a combination of education, medication, medical devices and improved food access to solve this national problem.
More in series:Solutions exist to end the Type 2 diabetes dilemma but too few get the help they need
The system is fixable, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.
But it will take "sensible action" from across many sectors, including health care, science, nutrition, business, public health and politics to change the financial and other incentives that drive so many Americans toward sickness instead of health.
"If we do it all, we could fix a lot of this in 10 years," said Mozaffarian, who serves on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. "If we do it incrementally or don't do it at all, we're all going to be toast in 50 years from diet-related illnesses and a depleted environment."
There’s no question personal responsibility plays a role in fighting diabetes. 
Haynes, Ray and Castrucci radically changed their lifestyles and sought help after their come-to-Jesus experiences. They’ve reduced their dependence on daily medication and hope to have saved themselves the horrors of more amputations, blindness and dialysis. They’ve extended their lives and improved the quality of that time.
But like many medical problems, the challenges of diabetes go well beyond individual responsibility and blame. 
“There are structural issues that we have to start paying attention to and addressing,” said Dr. Shivani Agarwal, an endocrinologist who specializes in research and treating young adults with diabetes at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Agarwal recently led a series of studies in the journal The Lancet that looked at diabetes rates around the world. 
Poverty, the studies showed, was a major driver of diabetes, along with racism and unequal access to healthy food and high-quality medical care.
Personal stories illustrate how these structural issues play out in the lives of so many Americans.
Ray, 45, director of culinary operations at HOSCO/North Sarah Food Hub in St. Louis, got weight-loss surgery and then put her culinary expertise to good use.  
Castrucci, 49, who runs a public health nonprofit outside Washington, D.C., used his advantages provided by his work, salary and insurance to “buy” himself better health.
 “I’m healthy because of privilege – not diet, not exercise, not determination,” he said.
Haynes, 58, a former truck driver and maintenance technician in Gulfport, Mississippi, has fewer material assets, but his attitude and the advantages he does have explain why he's still around, despite all he has been through.
“It’s going to be all right after a while, as long as I keep this spirit,” he said.
Ray’s love for food began when she was 8 years old, watching Julia Child on TV. During family gatherings, she would run around taking everyone’s dinner order. Then she’d scurry back to the kitchen with a notepad full of scribbles. 
Throughout her life, she made fried chicken, pork chops, baked mac and cheese, collard greens, and even a whole roasted chicken filled with wild rice and two sticks of butter – everything that made her soul sing. 
In her world, food was home. Food was family. Food was love. 
But that was some pretty tough love. 
In 2002, Ray was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Her father, grandmother, aunts and uncles all had diabetes. She knew what it meant.
“For you to tell me I can’t have ice blue raspberry Kool-Aid was like you shut down my world,” Ray said. “I didn’t want to accept it. So, I ate, because you eat through your emotions.” 
She didn't dwell on the diagnosis and continued with life. Her culinary career took her to Italy, where she learned and fell even more in love with food. She returned to St. Louis, got married and became a mom to her husband’s two children ‒ “beautiful bonus babies,” as she described them. Through the years, she continued to express love through cooking and eating. 
In 2015, a stabbing chest pain sent her to the emergency room. Doctors assured Ray she hadn’t had a heart attack, but they warned that her life was on the line. At 5-foot-2, she weighed 334 pounds and had an A1C, a measure of average blood sugar of 11%, well above the 6.5% cutoff to be considered diabetic. Her diabetes – and her diet – were out of control. 
“That scared me. … It was gut-wrenching and terrifying,” she said. “I’m fighting against something that’s fighting me back and I did not know how to win.” 
She and her primary care doctor decided she would pursue weight loss surgery. 
But she also decided to use her culinary prowess to transform her diet. She reconfigured favorite foods, substituting healthier ingredients: Collard greens cooked in smoked fats or ham hocks turned into a kale, turnip and rutabaga recipe flavored with natural chicken broth fat, oils and seasonings. 
She fostered her feelings into new recipes and brought them to North Sarah Food Hub, which partnered with Barnes-Jewish Hospital to make packaged, pre-made meals for St. Louis residents with diabetes and limited access to fresh food.
“I had to restructure the food that I put in my mouth. I had to think about what I was eating and how I was eating and how it was going to be good for my body,” she said. “I became excited about food again, and food became a joy.” 
It isn’t always easy, of course. Ray admits to an occasional cookie craving. But now she takes the time to think about how her body processes that cookie and whether it’s worthwhile. 
She hopes her cooking can help other people make the same transformation she did. Her staff at North Sarah helps her create new recipes for others. She wants to provide nourishment that allows people to avoid illness and medicine. 
“Nobody wants to take 55 pills, nobody wants to feel like a patient, but how do you fix that? It’s by our food,” she said. “That should be what we’re teaching our community and our culture and our children. … It’s not always about the macaroni noodle with a smile, it’s about what’s good for your body.” 
Castrucci is a third-generation diabetes patient. The lifetime risk of developing Type 2 diabetes if a parent has it is 40%. If both parents have it, the risk jumps to 70%.
He knew he was at risk, but he pushed his luck, he said, by eating poorly during the pandemic and falling out of his exercise routine. With the luxury of working from home, walking to the kitchen and bathroom was often the extent of his daily activity.
On Feb. 14, 2022 – Valentine’s Day – he went to an urgent care clinic, concerned his breathing trouble meant he had bronchitis. His blood pressure measured 210 over 110, well above normal levels that top out at 120 over 80. A chest X-ray showed fluid filling his lungs, leading to congestive heart failure. 
The clinic sent him straight to a local emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a blockage of the left descending artery – a clogged artery made worse by diabetes. If he had waited any longer, he would have had a massive heart attack, his doctor later told him.
After his release from the hospital, he went to the drugstore to fill his new prescriptions. The pharmacist told him she couldn’t fill one because it would cost $1,000. He’d have to wait until his insurance approved it. “Please fill it,” he said. She stressed the cost. “Fill it,” he pleaded, putting the charge on his credit card.
Medication helped him lose 70 pounds in three months. When his local drugstore ran out of the weight-loss drug, he easily drove to another pharmacy and then another to find what he needed. 
His 100 hours of high-quality cardiac rehabilitation were fully covered by insurance.  
"For my midlife crisis, I got healthy," Castrucci said.
He could devote all his energy to getting well because he didn’t have to focus on how to afford his care. “(I) paid almost nothing for the whole episode,” he said, “and never worried about it because I have really good insurance.” 
Even so, Castrucci pays out-of-pocket for a cardiologist and an endocrinologist because the best ones near him don’t accept insurance.
Every time he goes to Walgreens to refill his medications, Castrucci said, he sees someone turned away because they can’t afford their prescriptions. When they finally show up in the emergency room, “because they will,” they will cost the system far more, he said.
“Health outcomes are dictated by economics. It’s a whole side of privilege that we don’t always talk about.”
On the day Haynes stepped on a rusty nail in 2019, he walked all day as the nail pierced the sole of his sneaker and then his foot. By the time he took off his shoe that night, his foot was infected. He landed in the hospital for two months as doctors and nurses tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to get the infection and Haynes’ blood sugar under control.
By the time he was released, he knew enough about Type 2 diabetes to realize his daily blood sugar levels – typically in the mid-400s – were four times above what he had been told to shoot for.
But nothing he did or ate seemed to make a difference. He had long since traded ribs for salads, beer for water. 
His wife, Angela, barely noticed when James started wearing multiple pairs of socks, pouring powder on his feet and buying bigger shoes. His feet tingled a lot, he said, but he was coping with it. 
James ended up in the emergency room again, dehydrated and in need of antibiotics. The doctor amputated the baby toe on his right foot, leaving a large open wound. 
"We're going to leave this open because we'll probably have to take more,” Angela remembered the doctor saying. “I didn't like that we're not going to try to save anything, we're just going to start cutting.”
James was fading.
His arm muscles shriveled and he lost his Popeye physique. Antibiotics left him looking sickly, his voice so weak Angela could barely hear him. “I felt like I was watching my husband slowly dying,” she said.
Finally, taking her doctor sister’s advice, Angela emailed Dr. Foluso Fakorede’s office to ask for an appointment. She thought it would take months to get James in to see the heart disease specialist, but the office called and asked if they could come the next day. 
The Hayneses would end up going back to see Fakorede many times − sometimes twice in one week, driving more than five hours each way from Gulfport north to Cleveland, Mississippi.
“We started looking forward to these visits because there was always hope,” Angela Haynes said, though she felt guilty they were taking up so much of the important doctor’s time. 
Fakorede, who is on a personal mission to save people with diabetes from amputations, noticed what other doctors had missed. Haynes had blockages in blood vessels on both legs. 
Once he got the blood flowing again, Haynes began to feel better. His flesh returned to its normal color. The wound started healing at last. Walking became easier.
Then disaster struck again. 
On July 2, 2022, Haynes caught COVID-19. "Everything went downhill after that," he said.
During his 13-day illness, the bacteria in his foot raged out of control. He ended up back in the hospital and unable to withstand the long drive to Fakorede’s office.
Every week, a surgeon would come to the door of his hospital room and before even stepping all the way in ask Haynes whether he had decided to get his leg amputated. 
"This is my leg. I was born with this. And you're walking in like you're cutting a piece of cake," Haynes said.
He was worried about how he’d get around, how he’d be able to work to support his family if he had only one leg. No one took the time to explain why they thought the leg needed to come off or how he’d cope without it, Haynes said. 
In late November, he was finally sent home in a wheelchair. But just three weeks later, as he was getting out of the car after wound care, his right leg gave out and he fell to the ground. Back at the hospital, Haynes was told his foot was broken, essentially beyond repair. He agreed to a below-the-knee amputation.
Released right before Christmas, he spent the next three weeks in bed wondering how he’d manage the rest of his life.
Finally, it looked as if his luck might be turning around.
With the leg gone, his diabetes improved. His blood sugar dropped into the 120s or one-teens. His blurry vision cleared up.
During his long hospital stay, he befriended nurses and learned about a program for people who needed prostheses. The man who ran it called early in the year and said he had received a donated leg. If it fit Haynes, he could have it while waiting for insurance to pay for a personalized one. Miraculously, it did. 
Haynes spent the next six months teaching himself to walk again. The donor leg was heavy and uncomfortable. He wasn't mobile enough to hold down a job.
One late spring night, picking up dinner at a nearby restaurant, he headed to the bathroom for a pit stop. A sink had been leaking all day and Haynes slipped in the puddle, falling backward.
He's still recovering from the resulting wrist surgery.
He and Angela are living – barely – off her part-time salary as a secretary and a church organist.
Haynes has tried "at least three or four times" to receive government assistance, but they keep losing his paperwork, or not believing he's disabled, though he once checked himself out of the hospital and arrived at an appointment in his wheelchair to prove he didn't have a leg.
Still, he clings to his faith and the positive attitude he has long used to cheer up himself and others. These are his secret weapons against diabetes and everything else life throws his way.
"I try to put a smile on other people's faces," he said. "It keeps my day going."

The USA TODAY Best-selling Booklist is back!
After a brief hiatus, USA TODAY’s beloved bestsellers list has returned with the features and characteristics that have long made it the People’s Booklist.
Our goal remains the same: Provide book lovers with the best, most accurate snapshot of what people are reading by showing which titles are selling. It is a master list, unbound by genre and format, of what’s selling broadly across the U.S.
“I am so thrilled that the USA Today Best-selling Booklist is coming back!" says bestselling author Colleen Hoover in a statement. "It gives so many authors the wonderful opportunity to be recognized as bestsellers and for readers to discover their next favorite book.”
Hoover, the self-published writer turned bestselling powerhouse who's authored dozens of novels including "It Ends With Us" and "Verity," was the undisputed queen of the Booklist in 2022 and spent weeks atop the list. Her novel "It Starts With Us" claimed the No. 1 spot in its first week, her highest debut ever, selling more than 800,000 copies on its first day of sales. It was her fourth book to hit No. 1 in 2022.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
The USA TODAY list is a ranking of the top-selling titles each week from a broad range of businesses including major chains, independent bookstores and online retailers. It reflects combined sales of titles in print and electronic format, if available. Our data team weighs and compiles those numbers to generate the week's 150 top-selling titles. The rankings reflect sales from the previous Monday through Sunday. The full list will publish online at 6 a.m. Wednesdays, with the top 50 titles publishing in print Thursdays.
The list, which began in 1993, went on hiatus in December. It is the longest-running USA TODAY data journalism project.
In our continued commitment to bring readers more books coverage, USA TODAY is also excited to announce a new content partnership with The Novel Neighbor, an independently owned and operated bookstore in St. Louis. They are expert booksellers and passionate readers who are deeply connected to what their community is reading. With the partnership will come regular profiles of independent bookstores across the country, highlighting the important role of these businesses in their local communities. Novel Neighbor will also be sharing expert book recommendations and fun takes on book trends.
We can't wait to see what you've been reading!
SHEFAYIM KIBBUTZ, Israel − They exchanged text messages and emojis. Brief status updates with words of encouragement. A picture of the beloved family dog, Tutsi.
Until no more messages came.
And then, Cindy Flash, an American, and her Israeli husband, Igal, vanished into the violence, presumed kidnapped by Hamas.
Four days after Hamas attacked Israel, more than 100 Israelis and possibly dozens of foreign nationals are thought to be held captive in the Gaza Strip. At least 14 U.S. citizens have been killed and an unknown number are still unaccounted for.
Flash, 67, originally from St. Paul, Minnesota, is one of them. She lives in Kfar Aza, a kibbutz in southern Israel near Gaza, where some of the most harrowing and grisly stories have been emerging over the past few days.
"They are breaking down the safe room door," Flash said in one of her final messages to her daughter Keren, 34. "We need someone to come by the house right now." Keren had been communicating with her parents from a few houses away.
Keren described her mother, an administrator in a local college, as someone who had the "sweetest biggest heart," whom everyone knew and loved, and who had spent a lifetime advocating for the rights of Palestinians, including those who live in Gaza, where she may now be held.
She emigrated to Israel decades ago after a visit during college, when she fell in love with Israel's system of kibbutzim − collectives traditionally centered on agriculture but which have evolved to accommodate myriad interests, tastes and even businesses. 
"They didn't deserve this,'' her daughter said Tuesday on the grounds of a sprawling hotel and resort on a coastal kibbutz northeast of Tel Aviv, where hundreds of people were evacuated after the attack. "No one deserves this."
It was filled with volunteers bringing sandwiches and sweetcakes. Sobbing teenagers, reunited after days of having their worst fears confirmed, hugged one another tightly. Small groups of people sat at tables hunched over laptops compiling lists of the missing. A manager said about 300 people from Kfar Aza were staying at the hotel.
Before the attack, Kfar Aza had a population of about 800. Nobody knows for sure how many survived. 
Cindy and Igal's home in Kfar Aza sits right next to the security fence Hamas militants broke through Saturday morning as they attacked Israel by land, sea and air.
The couple had recently renovated it, which had required that they move away from the kibbutz for a few months.
"They were so happy to be back," Keren said.
And their daughter said that despite their proximity to Gaza, everyone in the family had always felt secure and reveled in their area's lush vegetation, tranquility and sense of community.
In fact, the extended Flash family had expected a very different Saturday from the one they got. 
They had planned a family picnic. And later that afternoon they were going to make and fly kites in the local soccer field as part of an annual community event. Maybe, they thought, they'd have a little ice cream and relax after a hectic week of family life and work. A DJ was going to play.
Instead, Keren, a Pilates instructor, and her husband, Avidor Schwartzman, 37, a media consultant, woke abruptly around 6:30 a.m. to a blaring alarm system and heard what appeared to be the sound of bombs going off. They leaped out of bed and dashed down the hall to grab their 1-year-old baby, Saar, and her bottle, diapers, water and a little food. Then they locked themselves in a room of concrete and reinforced steel.
Around the same time, Cindy and Igal, 66, locked themselves in their own safe room. The sounds of bombs gradually turned into the sounds of automatic gunfire as Hamas militants encircled Kfar Aza and began going house to house to hunt people down.
"We started losing contact with so many people on various WhatsApp groups," said Keren, who along with Avidor and Saar was eventually rescued by Israeli security services. ''We would hear that they were wounded, and then they would just drop off completely."
Israel media reported Tuesday that the bodies of 40 children and babies were found in Kfar Aza, some of whom had been beheaded. An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said Kfar Aza was a "massacre." The bodies of civilians and militants were found scattered throughout the kibbutz. He declined to comment on the beheadings. One report, which USA TODAY could not independently verify, said that multiple people had been beheaded and that charred bodies had been found. The Israeli death toll from the Hamas attack has passed 1,200.
Neither the U.S. nor Israeli authorities had been able to provide them with any information about where her parents might be, Keren said.
But she had not lost hope they would be found.
"Anytime someone calls us, any authority from the kibbutz or anywhere, our hearts sink down, and then they say, 'We don't have any new information.'"
Shaylee Atary, 34, another Kfar Aza resident, spent several days coming to terms with this feeling as well.
She last saw her husband, Yahav Winner, 37, on Saturday as he barricaded a window of their home to allow time for Shaylee and their 1-month old daughter, Shaya, to flee.
"He kept saying to me, 'This is not the day we are going to die,'" Atary said.
"We could hear the attackers walking on the grass outside the window. There was a crunching sound because the leaves have started to fall down because of the season. We couldn't talk because we didn't want them to hear our voices, so we were signaling silently to each other. And then, as they were breaking through the window, Yahav looked at me for a quarter-second. He didn't say goodbye, but I understood that it was like a kind of signal that I should run."
She fled first to some nearby bushes, and then to an empty garden shed.
And running, for Atary, is hard because of a car accident that has made it difficult for her to walk. She also was carrying Shaya.
As she hid in the shed, Atary found a hammer and screwdriver, which she put in her pockets. She put some old pots on her and Shaya's head, who was − miraculously − asleep.
But then the baby woke up and began to cry, which attracted the attention of the attackers. She could hear them walking toward her. She feared they would shoot into the shed indiscriminately.
"I knew I had to run again," she said. "But this time, it was a decision, not so much an instinct. So again I fled, and when I reached a large grassy area that is in the middle of our kibbutz, I thought 'Well, maybe this is how I die, despite what Yahav said.'"
Moments later, a family with children sheltering in their home saw her and ushered her inside, risking their lives. She stayed in this safe room for the next 27 hours, without food or water, and as the oxygen in the sealed safe room dwindled, before they were rescued by Israel's military.
"Yahav is a very protective," she said of her husband. "He's also smart. I believe he probably surrendered to allow us to escape."
Late Tuesday the news finally came. Yahav's body had been found.
"In my head now, I tell myself that when he looked at me what he was saying was: 'Shaylee, you are with the child. I'm holding the door. Go'," she said.
"Then I think, why didn't I say: 'Don't be a hero. Come with me.'"

Is Iran behind Hamas terrorist attacks?What it would mean for US and Middle East security
The U.S. government announced it will provide charter flights for American citizens and their immediate families looking to leave Israel.
The flights, which are set to begin on Friday, will operate to locations in Europe where there is more commercial capacity across the Atlantic. U.S. citizens in Israel in need of assistance should complete the crisis intake form at travel.state.gov. 
“We are all acutely aware of limited availability right now on commercial flights out of Israel and the demand signal of U.S. citizens who may want to depart. The president has asked his team to ensure we are assisting U.S. citizens who do want to leave Israel in providing them with a safe means of doing that,” John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council said during a White House press briefing Thursday. “We’re also exploring other options to expand the capacity of doing this including exploring whether it’s possible to help Americans leave by land and by sea.” 
Kirby said that the State Department is still finalizing details of the plan and did not make more specifics available.

It’s hard to wrap your mind around: The social justice warriors on college campuses around America have come out in support of terrorists who last weekend raped and murdered and beheaded innocent people (including children, women and the elderly) in Israel. 
These are the same students who need safe spaces from those who may talk about race or gender in a way they find offensive, or who will shout down and demand the cancellation of speakers with whom they disagree.
Yet, some of them seem perfectly OK with defending the atrocities committed when Hamas invaded Israel in a surprise attack in which the terrorists murdered at least 1,200 Israelis; 27 Americans also died and more than a dozen are missing. 
It seems the higher ed bubble has decided it’s “woke” to support Hamas and to shun Israel, regardless of how horrific the situation. 
And even though many of these students believe “words are violence,” they defend real violence. 
Supporting Israel:Biden's response to Hamas terror attack was weak. US needs strong leadership to support allies.
Student organizations at more than a dozen prominent U.S. universities have issued statements pointing the full blame of the Hamas attack on the back of Israel. Those include Columbia University, the University of Michigan Law School and Northwestern University. 
And on Thursday, local university chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine are planning a “day of resistance” and “protest for Palestine.” In other words, they are standing in solidarity with Hamas terrorists who just slaughtered innocents in the name of “resistance.”
Sickeningly, posters advertising the events highlight a paraglider. Hamas terrorists used paragliders to descend into Israel and proceeded to murder hundreds of young people at a music festival. 
Perhaps the worst offenders – or at least the ones who have received the most attention – are the more than 30 student groups at Harvard University who signed on to a letter stating they “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.”
“Today’s events did not occur in a vacuum,” the students state. “For the last two decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison. Israeli officials promise to ‘open the gates of hell,’ and the massacres in Gaza have already commenced.
“In the coming days, Palestinians will be forced to bear the full brunt of Israel’s violence. The apartheid regime is the only one to blame.”
The statement has unsurprisingly attracted backlash, and the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee has since hidden the names of the other groups that signed on to the misguided missive. 
You can't say that:Oberlin coach stood up for women in sports. Then faced public shaming from her college.
The students haven’t apologized per se, however. They simply seem taken aback that their outrageous views aren’t being welcomed with open arms.
For instance, some major CEOs and investors are calling on Harvard to release the names of the students who signed the statement – so that they can make sure they never employ these people.
Harsh? Maybe. Deserved? Yes. 
As Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz (and Harvard Law grad) posited on X, formerly Twitter: “What the hell is wrong with Harvard?”
Former Harvard President Lawrence Summers has also publicly called out the student statement: “Harvard is being defined by the morally unconscionable statement apparently coming from two dozen student groups blaming all the violence on Israel. I am sickened. I cannot fathom the Administration’s failure to disassociate the University and condemn this statement.”
As of this writing, the Harvard administration has refrained from directly condemning the student statement. 
I’m a firm supporter of free speech, and I think the lack of open debate on college campuses is a huge problem. While one can argue that these student groups have the right to say whatever they want, it’s certainly worth questioning why so many "top" institutions are defending such awful acts.
Canceling comedy:Hope for free speech? Kat Timpf riffs on the power of comedy and dangers of cancel culture.
It’s not just students who are to blame here. They are learning this behavior from somewhere.
Yale associate professor Zareena Grewal, for example, has come out openly in support of Hamas terrorism, stating that “settlers are not civilians" after Saturday's attacks. And college administrations that like to issue statements on pretty much everything else have been noticeably silent now. 
Greg Lukianoff, CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, recently put it this way: “If you find yourself, you know, cheering the people who are raping, murdering, kidnapping … shouldn’t that be a point for reflection?”
It should.
For students and administrators who remain puzzled about how to respond to the attack on Israel, Ben Sasse, the president of the University of Florida (and former GOP U.S. senator), offered an excellent example:
“Our educational mission here begins with the recognition and explicit acknowledgment of human dignity – the same human dignity that Hamas’ terrorists openly scorn. Every single human life matters. We are committed to that truth. We will tell that truth.”

Detroit Lions linebacker Alex Anzalone said in a social media post Thursday his parents are on their way home to Florida after being stranded in Jerusalem when war broke out between Israel and Hamas last weekend.
"Thank you to everyone who has been saying prayers for my family and their safety," Anzalone wrote on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. "It's been a scary, anxiety-filled several days but my parents are headed home safely. So many people to thank but I know this, God is good."
Anzalone first shared news of his parents' plight after the Lions' 42-24 win over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday, when he commented on a social media post by U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, who said 53 of his constituents were visiting the country and looking to leave as soon as possible.
Anzalone later deleted the post.
Lions coach Dan Campbell said Wednesday he was unaware Anzalone's parents were in the region until after the game.

Anzalone led the Lions with a season-high 11 tackles against the Panthers.
"That’s a tough deal out there," Campbell said. "I have not heard anything new on that. I don’t want to elaborate on anything, but he felt they were safe. It’s just finding a way out, but that can’t − I know it’s not easy. I know it’s not easy. And I know it weighs on him heavy, so that’s a tough deal out there, man."
Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, invaded Israel on Saturday. At least 22 Americans and more than 1,200 Israelis had died in the fighting as of Wednesday, according to USA Today. An additional 17 Americans remain unaccounted for, and fighting is ongoing. The Palestinian Ministry of Health says 900 people have died in the Gaza Strip since Israel began retaliatory attacks.
Anzalone's parents traveled to Jerusalem as part of a church group with First Baptist Church Naples.
The church posted an update earlier this week on its Facebook page from pastor Alan Brumback, who is on the trip, saying the group was "doing good at our hotel in Jerusalem."
"Continue to pray for Israel and for this to be resolved as peacefully and quickly as possible," the post said. "We are trusting in the Lord and we know that God’s got this."

The UAW strike against the Ford Kentucky Truck Plant is a signal that hourly workers are willing to inflict − and sustain − increasingly serious financial pain to achieve their goals during labor negotiations, as the union and the Detroit Three approach a full month without resolution.
The financial impact of the surprise strike called Wednesday night was swift and immediate.
LAS VEGAS – The Green Bay Packers aren’t a talentless team.
They probably have as much or more talent than two of the three teams that have beaten them this year.
But, boy, are they a bad team.
Their offense is a mess. Their defense can be pretty good but only to a point. They are affected any time one of their starters can’t play because of injury. And they have too many players who just do what they’re told and not whatever it takes to be a difference-maker.

Lior Onaly-Kelsey celebrated their 15th birthday two weeks ago. They also celebrated the end of a years-long battle against Greater Albany Public School District.
A federal jury in Eugene this month awarded them $317,353 in damages, concluding the district had discriminated against Onaly-Kelsey when they were in the third grade and failed to properly respond to harassment and bullying.
At a park near their house, Onaly-Kelsey seems happy and curious, eagerly sharing stories about rock climbing and participating in their current school's robotics club.
Their excitement to be a teen attending a Corvallis high school is a stark difference from their emotions as an Albany elementary school student.
Indigenous land acknowledgments are everywhere.
After taking hold on college campuses, they are recited with growing frequency at schools, sporting events and church services.
They are added as signatures at the end of emails. They are being posted on the websites of museums, libraries, and other institutions as the era of racial reckoning and social justice that has followed the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement and the killing of George Floyd continues to evolve.
They are even yelled at concerts, as reggae artist Nattali Rize did during a recent show in Phoenix, drawing loud applause.
Some of the statements are as brief as a single sentence.
Spoon Daftary apologized into his headset for a slightly rushed segment, but the clock was already ticking on this commercial break. 
"Just go with the flow," the "Thursday Night Football" senior coordinating producer ordered from the command truck at FedEx Field, not long after the Chicago Bears defeated the Washington Commanders. "Everyone have fun here." 
That’s usually not an issue for the traveling studio crew of Richard Sherman, Andrew Whitworth, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Tony Gonzalez and host Charissa Thompson – the people Daftary is instructing from the truck. They were about to play a game, he said, as celebrity chef David Chang rejoined the set. 
It’s a simple premise. Producers from the truck will put up a name on the screen. The panel must answer whether that person played in the NFL or is a United States Congressperson – "On the Hill" or "On the Field" – all while chowing down on spicy chicken sandwiches from Chang’s restaurant.
"Roll the dice here," Daftary said. "What can go wrong?"

The hijinks may lose a viewer more interested in a traditional NFL post-game show. But for the type of content Daftary’s bosses at Amazon Prime Video desire, this is par for the course. 
Now in the second year of exclusively streaming the games, Daftary wants the postgame show to be memorable enough – through both creative bits and substantive football conversation – sports fans are talking about it Friday morning. 
"My dream is somebody says, ‘Ah, (expletive), I fell asleep. What did I miss?’" Daftary told USA TODAY Sports. "That’s what I want to continue to push to our staff and to our talent. I want our show to be that: ‘I gotta stay up late to watch.’" 
As Daftary and executive producer Mike Muriano started building the “TNF” studio team, they were aware of the natural constraints all pregame, halftime and postgame shows have structurally. But as Amazon became the league's first new media partner in nearly 30 years, the company also saw the opportunity of a blank canvas. 
"We're OK with this feeling a little more raw and authentic, I think, than sort of the polished Sunday morning pregame shows that I've been a part of in the past," said Daftary, who spent nine years at FOX, where he held the same role for "FOX NFL Kickoff." 
Daftary said FOX’s takeover of the NFC package in 1993 ushered in the modern era of studio programming. A streaming giant taking center stage for the NFL one night per week represented a chance to take another step toward the boundaries. 
"Collectively, we're just like, ‘We have to take some swings, we know not everything’s gonna be great," Daftary said. "But like, we want to take the swings and see where we land." 
One place they landed this season was Intercourse, Pennsylvania, for a dispatch by contributor Marshawn Lynch from Amish country. 
That type of segment likely would not have been flown at network television. At Amazon, it’s encouraged. 
"It's refreshing," Muriano told USA TODAY Sports. "Sometimes, senior management is saying ‘No, push a little bit more’ and we're the ones going, ‘Hey, not that far.’" 
Finding talking heads who took the job seriously – but not necessarily themselves – has been essential in delivering a different type of show, Muriano said. Their willingness to pitch ideas makes the show that much better, he added. 
"We've got a group that is invested that way, which again, that's so rewarding to see that you're not the only one trying to come up with everything," said Muriano, who has been involved in producing every "Thursday Night Football" game in NFL history. "The show is better for it." 
Thompson, Fitzpatrick, Sherman, Whitworth, Gonzalez and the producers will have a video call – a 45-minute brain dump, as Daftary put it – every Monday to discuss that week’s upcoming game. From there, the producers begin outlining a show ahead of a Monday afternoon production call in which the sketch becomes more of a rundown. Last week, when Daftary mentioned that Fitzpatrick lost his mind upon hearing that Commanders part-owner Magic Johnson would be joining the pregame show, the producers started coming up with ideas to leverage his fanboying into a made-for-TV moment. 
Reading the letters Fitzpatrick wrote to Johnson as a boy was one idea. The crew brainstormed ways for Johnson to sign items for Fitzpatrick and how to place that into the segment. Of course, it would have to be right before commercial break. And they’d have to make sure Johnson sat next to the former quarterback. 
When it was showtime 72 hours later, Fitzpatrick was all smiles as he unveiled his No. 32 Lakers jersey beneath his signature zany button-down shirt. 
"Spoon allows for that creativity, allows for us to have a little bit of fun on set," Fitzpatrick told USA TODAY Sports. "So the fact we do have that leeway and he’s given us that creative freedom, I think really helps the process. We don’t feel limited or put in boxes."
The postgame show – "TNF Nightcap" – is the aspect of the production the team takes “a ton” of pride in, Daftary said.
"That’s a place we have an open canvas to do a lot of things that other shows don’t – between our guest interviews and our actual football conversations, which, by the way, I would put up against anybody else’s actual football conversations," Daftary said. 
Through four weeks, "TNF Nightcap" is averaging 2.08M viewers, which is an increase of 24% over last year’s full-season average (1.68M), according to Prime Video. (“TNF Tonight,” the pregame show, is averaging 500,000 more viewers per week compared to 2022.)
The morning of the Bears-Commanders matchup, the crew met in a hotel conference room to review the show rundown. On more than one occasion, as Daftary lead the meeting, the talent are told to save it for the show.
"We've been part of shows where almost every word is rehearsed and gone through," Muriano said. "And we've been shown we've been on parts of shows where not enough of that has happened as well."
Finding the sweet spot is the challenge of creating programming in 2023 for a streaming service. Other market forces, like podcasts, have influenced the way they construct the show too. 
"It's so less-produced," Daftary said. "So how do we still produce a show that feels network-level where our halftime is gonna be viewed by (millions of) people? So it's not a podcast, we don't want it to be a podcast. The elements in the show have to reach a bar." 
That type of transition made it easier on the trio of Whitworth, Fitzpatrick and Sherman, all of whom went straight from the playing field to analysts’ chairs (Gonzalez and Thompson both had ample television experience prior to joining “TNF”). Everyone had homework following an offseason of reviewing video, and former players' experience make them more coachable than other people Daftary has worked with in the past. 
Making sure they don’t lose their personality by improving for television is a fine line to walk. 
"If something becomes too rehearsed, it just feels like audiences have just gotten so savvy," said Muriano, who has an instant focus-group with four teenage children watching at home. "That teenage radar really just sniffs out when something's not authentic so quickly in this day and age. And I think it's because there's so much content they're consuming in different ways. As soon as they see someone kind of stiffen up, they’re like, ‘Why isn't he just talking normal? Why isn't she just talking normally?’ So we try to stay as real as we can." 
The "TNF" team met throughout the offseason to preview that year's upcoming games. During one of those sessions, it became clear that a "Quiz Bowl" for the Week 3 game between the San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants in the Bay Area would be the perfect setting. Sherman went to Stanford. Gonzalez is a proud Cal product. Fitzpatrick famously graduated from Harvard.
But that "TNF Tonight" led to the most viral moment of the season, with ex-NFL quarterback Andrew Luck dressing in meme version, "Capt. Andrew Luck," a social media account that likened Luck's football conquests to a Civil War-era Union soldier.
"I want a space where everybody can pitch an idea, and anyone can pitch an idea," said Daftary, who almost talked Luck out of dressing up in costume for his postgame appearance only to realize he was overthinking the bit.
"That would be the perfect amount of craziness," he realized.
To close out the Week 5 broadcast from the nation's capital, Daftary and Co. wanted to capitalize on a "wild" week in D.C. Kevin McCarthy had been ousted as Speaker of the House. Something political – but not polarizing – felt appropriate.
"Is this going to be the greatest thing ever? Probably not," Daftary said. "But it’ll be a fun way to end the show. We got David Chang, we got fried chicken sandwiches."
With the cameras rolling, Thompson – the only one who had prior knowledge of the game – accidentally gave away the answer to the first question.
No memes or viral posts came from the segment. A few laughs for sure. The show ended with Daftary shaking the hands of those around him in the truck. He said the segment featuring Fitzpatrick being honored at his high school the previous weekend was too much. Muriano assured him it was fine.
"I'm not going to lose sleep over it," Daftary said.
He hopes everyone else watching did.
Be careful what you wish for, Dallas Cowboys.
As fallout lingers from the blowout loss at San Francisco, the Cowboys are so deep into their feelings about the 42-10 result that it’s fair to wonder if they are capable of recovering – physically and mentally.
During his podcast, "The Edge with Micah Parsons," the Cowboys' star linebacker took exception to the "(expletive) Dallas" T-shirt that 49ers tight end George Kittle wore under his jersey as he scorched Dallas for three touchdowns. Kittle revealed his wardrobe accessory on a social media post on Monday.
 "I just feel like he’s making it way more personal than it had to be," Parsons said Tuesday. "Kittle’s my guy, but I'ma say this: laugh now, cry later. We got something for that. If we see them again, just trust."
Trust the Cowboys? No way.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
The Cowboys, 28 years and counting since the franchise’s last whiff of Super Bowl glory, have proven (again) that they cannot be trusted as a legitimate contender. Maybe that changes by January. But that needs to be proven in the flesh as they’ve over-promised so many times before in morphing from America’s Team to America’s Biggest Tease. Such an identity remains intact about now.
At this point, any threats coming from the Cowboys about what they’ll do to the 49ers have zero credibility. Remember, Dallas was supposed to use the prime-time showcase on Sunday night as a measuring stick. And the 49ers basically took that stick and cracked the Cowboys on the butt with it.
The defense that Parsons leads? The Cowboys went to San Francisco with the unit allowing the fewest points in the league, like 10 points per game. They left as the defense that gave up six touchdowns and 421 yards and had a terrible time getting off the field on third downs.
So, again, any promises about what will happen if they see them again would be ill-advised.
Thus, the 49ers are still scoring points in this rout – of which Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said “may be the most humbling game I’ve ever been a part of” after he faltered in yet another big game – with the social media aftermath.
Deebo Samuel, the electric and versatile 49ers receiver, had a pointed response to Parsons’ take:
"It was always personal before the game started," Samuel told Kay Adams on the "Up & Adams" podcast. "42-10, I don’t think you wanna see us again. It might be a little worse."
Ouch. Or touchdown, 49ers.
Can we stick a fork in the Cowboys already and declare that this season is kaput? Maybe not yet. It’s the NFL, with its week-to-week reality checks. Look at what happened to Buffalo, a week after destroying the Dolphins: They went to London to get served up by the Jaguars.
This is not the time of year to draw conclusions about what will happen in January – even though it seems clear that if they stay healthy, the 49ers and Eagles will be major factors. And as long as Patrick Mahomes is in the lineup, the Chiefs have a shot.
Dallas? Perhaps the Cowboys (3-2) peaked with a 40-0 beatdown of the Giants on opening night. A week after handing Bill Belichick the worst margin of defeat in his career, blasting the not-so-good Patriots, 38-3, Mike McCarthy suffered the most decisive loss in his three-plus years as Cowboys coach.
"It’s been a wide range of performance, as wide a range that I could ever recall in a 5-week period," McCarthy said after the debacle on Sunday night.
On paper, the Cowboys are not done yet.
There are 12 games left. Just one of Dallas’ next six opponents – Philadelphia (5-0) – currently has a winning record. A path to get back into the race in the NFC East still exists, given the two matchups looming against the Eagles in November and December. Then again, the Eagles will be just as eager as the 49ers to demonstrate a special kind of animosity toward Dallas.
In any event, the expectation correction for the Cowboys has just happened. After showing that figuratively they don’t belong on the same field with the 49ers, the Cowboys find themselves facing a must-win predicament when meeting the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium on Monday night.
Never mind the subplot of facing a Chargers offense now orchestrated by Kellen Moore, the former Cowboys coordinator. It’s about survival, or at least rebounding to restore some confidence after absorbing so many blows during the humiliating loss on Sunday night.
As Kittle, of all people, pointed out on Sunday night, there’s also a pattern to watch when it comes to what happens after teams play the 49ers. Kittle suggested that there’s a residual effect.
"We’re a violent, physical football team," Kittle said, alluding to the smashmouth style on offense that complements a punishing defense. "That’s the standard of the 49ers. Last year, every team that played us lost the next week."
It’s a striking pattern. Including the playoffs, teams that played the 49ers last season were 0-15 in games the following week. The Chiefs won their next game after facing San Francisco last October, but it came after Kansas City had a bye week. And the Eagles had a bye week following the NFC title game, although it indeed lost in the Super Bowl.
Pittsburgh snapped the “next-week” streak last month. Blown out by the 49ers in Week 1, the Steelers rallied to defeat Cleveland the following week. The next three 49ers opponents, though, followed suit with last season’s pattern and lost the following week.
Now the trend is attached to Dallas’ challenge to get back on track after a grueling loss to the 49ers. 
Tony Pollard, the Cowboys running back limited to 29 rushing yards at San Francisco, was upbeat on Sunday night when assessing how they can rebound.
"Get back to work," Pollard said. "Go back to the lab. You have to prepare. You have to get ready and brush it off. We’ll see this team again, so we have to lock in for the next one."
See the 49ers again? Officially, that’s a maybe for the Cowboys this season.
No, the Cowboys likely can’t achieve the dream of winning a championship without getting past the 49ers. But considering the way San Francisco has owned them in recent years, the Cowboys had better be careful of what they wish for.
NFL power rankings entering Week 6 of the 2023 season (previous rank in parentheses):
1. 49ers (1): What else is there to say about a team that's been in the top spot since the season started? S.F.’s +99 point differential is already 20 better than the next team. Probably have the best defense (though that can be settled at Cleveland on Sunday). Might have the best offense. Stars on basically every unit. And second-year QB Brock Purdy continues to effectively play mistake-free football, his league-leading 123.1 passer rating testament to that.
2. Eagles (3): They're 5-0 in successive seasons for the first time. Next up, the Jets – a team Philadelphia has never lost to in 12 previous meetings. Feels safe to slot the reigning NFC champs at 6-0 and look ahead to their Week 7 date with Miami.
3. Lions (5): For all the focus on rookie Jahmyr Gibbs, it's veteran RB David Montgomery who's fueled a ground game with more rushes than any team in the league save two. Sunday, Montgomery became the first Detroit rusher to top 100 yards in consecutive games since … Kevin Jones in 2004.
4. Chiefs (6): Here's a stat that might surprise you – RB Isiah Pacheco leads Kansas City with 424 yards from scrimmage, nearly double TE Travis Kelce's total (222).
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
5. Bills (2): Just as LB Von Miller returns from the PUP list following last year's knee injury, LB Matt Milano (leg) could be lost for the remainder of this season. Weird as this sounds, Milano might be the more valuable player to Buffalo's defense.
6. Dolphins (7): How fast is Miami? Per Next Gen Stats, the Fins have produced the five top speeds among all plays this season and seven of the top nine. WR Tyreek Hill and RBs De'Von Achane and Raheem Mostert are responsible for them (and WR Jaylen Waddle has also cracked the top 20). Big-play Achane is averaging a ridiculous 12.1 yards per carry and 115.0 rushing yards per game, both figures best in the NFL. But seems likely a knee injury will force veteran Jeff Wilson to spot Achane in the coming weeks.
7. Jaguars (14): The first team to play multiple international games in a season is now the first to win multiple – both coming against teams with winning records. Stay in Europe, Jags – it seems inevitable, and you're apparently better for it.
8. Cowboys (4): Good thing they're not part of the NFC West … even if it would make more sense geographically. In its two defeats (to Arizona and San Francisco), Dallas has lost by a collective 70-26. Worse, the Niners seemed to expose how limited the Mike McCarthy offense might actually be.
9. Steelers (12): They've gained the third-fewest yards in the league and surrendered the third most, the delta more than 600 yards. But 11 takeaways, 17 sacks and just enough clutch plays from QB Kenny Pickett can mask such warts … and propel you to the top of the AFC North.
10. Ravens (8): It's been an uneven start, to say the least, but it's also unusual to play four of five away from home so early in the season – and Baltimore's three-game roadie winds to a conclusion Sunday in London.
11. Rams (9): Sure, they're 2-3, but they've hung tough against the league's top teams, San Francisco and Philadelphia. Appears WRs Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua will complement each other nicely, each getting at least 11 targets Sunday, Kupp's 2023 debut.
12. Seahawks (10): Coming off their bye, they're currently not scheduled to face a team with a winning record until November. Time to make serious hay toward a playoff berth.
13. Browns (13): Semi-eventful bye week with GM Andrew Berry explaining QB Deshaun Watson's last-minute scratch in Cleveland's previous game while defending the trade of obviously capable veteran QB2 Josh Dobbs during preseason.
14. Buccaneers (16): This marks three times in four years that QB Baker Mayfield has won three of his first four starts. His only 4-1 beginning led to a deep playoff run in Cleveland.
15. Saints (20): Great sidebar to Sunday's 34-0 runaway in New England. TE Foster Moreau, a New Orleans native, scored his first TD with the Saints – and first since beating Hodgkin lymphoma during the offseason. Pretty cool story amid the NFL's annual "Crucial Catch" campaign for cancer screening.
16. Falcons (18): If you know anything about the NFL, and running backs in particular, best to appreciate their genius while you can. Thankfully, Bijan Robinson has been putting his on display week in and week out, Sunday's TD catch-and-run a thing of beauty.
17. Colts (17): QB2 Gardner Minshew II may be the league's best reliever, but Indianapolis surely didn't count on him playing 50% of the snaps to this point – a figure that's going to rise as Anthony Richardson's sprained throwing shoulder heals.
18. Texans (11): No matter Sunday's outcome, this will be their best six-game start since 2019. But it would help if Houston would run the ball better after cracking 90 yards just once so far this season.
19. Titans (21): WR DeAndre Hopkins' 100-yard day courtesy of Ryan Tannehill was the 11th time he's topped the century mark with a different quarterback. Get a C-note with two more passers, and Nuk sets a league record … so might be worthy lobbying for playing time for Malik Willis and rookie Will Levis.
20. Chargers (22): Did you know WR Keenan Allen owns the NFL record for most games – three – with at least 15 receptions? With wingman Mike Williams down for the count, wouldn't be a shock if Allen extends that mark before this year is out.
21. Jets (24): Only 12 games into his career, he hardly has enough totes to qualify – but if he did, Breece Hall's 6.3 yards per carry would be a record among RBs. Unfortunately, could be hard to sustain that with OL Alijah Vera-Tucker (Achilles) headed to injured reserve.
22. Bengals (26): They'll only be on the road two more times before December, so maybe the comforts of home are good for QB Joe Burrow's calf and team focus with a brutal upcoming schedule (Seattle, San Francisco, Buffalo) for a Cincinnati club that may finally otherwise be turning the corner.
23. Raiders (28): If they're going to salvage their season and use Monday's win as a catapult, now is the time. The Silver and Black face three one-win teams (Patriots, Bears, Giants) over the next four weeks.
24. Packers (19): No worse way to go into a bye week than off a terrible loss. But Green Bay's next three opponents (Broncos, Vikings, Rams) have a combined four wins, so hopefully a good time for the Pack to get healthy figuratively and literally.
25. Vikings (25): Why is offensive balance often a virtue? Consider one-win Minnesota, which has thrown more passes (204) than any team in the league while attempting the fewest runs (91). However that calculus might have to change with All-Pro Justin Jefferson's hamstring injury forcing him to IR.
26. Bears (32): The Justin Fields-to-DJ Moore Show has sparked Chicago's revival. But look closer, and you'll also note a running game averaging better than 170 yards the past two weeks and some encouraging signs of life on defense at Washington. The schedule also suggests Da Bears could easily be a .500 team from here on out.
27. Commanders (15): Only Denver has surrendered more points than Washington's 160. Only Minnesota has turned it over more times than Washington's 10. Lethal combo.
28. Broncos (29): Naturally, when you crown yourselves with dopey "snowcapped" helmets, another Rocky Mountain meltdown is completely inevitable.
29. Giants (30): S Jason Pinnock's 102-yard pick-six Sunday is the longest play of the season NFL-wide and provided Big Blue's first TD before halftime this season. Some consolation for a team that hasn't run an offensive play with the lead yet and has now been outscored by a league-most 91 points.
30. Cardinals (27): No NFC team is blitzing less frequently – worth wondering if that's the right approach given the way Arizona's D has been torn up the past two weeks.
31. Patriots (23): If the dynasty wasn't already dead, then life support has officially been unplugged. Bill Belichick wants to "start over" after suffering the two worst defeats of his career with an offense that's been shut out of the end zone for 10 consecutive quarters and has turned it over 10 times.
32. Panthers (31): The NFL's only winless team just turned in its worst defensive performance (42 points allowed) of the season. Its reward? A trip to Miami. Woof.

Week 5 in the NFL provided needed perspective.
In all, the slate didn't provide too many stunning outcomes or last-second twists. But four of the top 10 teams in USA TODAY Sports' power rankings suffered a loss this week, and some of the top outfits continued to separate themselves from the pack as they expanded their body of work. Meanwhile, other groups that had missteps in the first few weeks had the chance to start setting things straight − or see their seasons spiral further out of control.
Here's our full rundown of the biggest winners and losers from Week 5 in the NFL:
What's scary about the 5-0 49ers is not solely the manner in which they thoroughly dismantled the Dallas Cowboys in a 42-10 blowout on Sunday night, but rather that it all seemed a little ordinary. That's life as the clearly best team in football after five weeks.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
Still, let's not let one of the most sterling performances of the early season pass by without giving it proper recognition. Brock Purdy once again made everything look easy in the role of distributor, shelling out four touchdown passes, including three to tight end George Kittle. San Francisco managed to outgain Dallas by nearly 225 yards (422-197) and is now one of five teams in league history to score 30+ points in eight consecutive regular-season games. The defense, meanwhile, perplexed Dak Prescott and Co. throughout the contest. With the rest of the October schedule filled by teams at or below .500, it could be some time before we see a meaningful challenge for a group that has tied a franchise record with 15 consecutive wins.
Is it too late for them to offer to take either the Baltimore Ravens' or Tennessee Titans' spot in next week's London tilt to go for the triple? In handling the Buffalo Bills in a 25-20 win after last week's victory over the Atlanta Falcons, the Jaguars became the first NFL team to play consecutive games abroad. Being on the move seems to suit them well, as they are now 3-0 this year away from EverBank Stadium. 
But there were plenty of things Sunday that Jacksonville can take back home to Duval County. Trevor Lawrence pushed past some miscues to establish the electric connection with Calvin Ridley (seven catches, 122 yards) that fans had been hoping to see since this summer. Running back Travis Etienne wore down a gassed defense and ripped off a 35-yard touchdown to help put the game out of reach. And the defense kept Josh Allen off balance with consistent pressure via the blitz. With a manageable schedule before the Week 9 bye, the Jaguars have a chance to create some distance in the AFC South race and set up a favorable outlook for playoff seeding.
Netting one offensive touchdown against what is far and away the league's worst defense is nothing to brag about, but Sunday was about far more than the stats for Hackett and the New York Jets. After Sean Payton opened up to USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell by ripping into Hackett's performance last year as the Denver Broncos' coach, both the Jets offensive coordinator and head coach Robert Saleh seemed to address the hypercritical comments through gritted teeth in recent months. No need to hold back anymore, however, after Sunday's 31-21 win over Denver. Sure, maybe Breece Hall deserved the game ball over Hackett after he rescued the offense with his 72-yard scoring scamper and 177 rushing yards overall. But Hackett can now let the result – as well as the Jets' players and social media team – do all the talking for him.
In the first four weeks of the season, Ridder was a severely limiting factor for the Falcons' burgeoning offense, which averaged a league-worst 156 yards through the air during that span. This week, the second-year signal-caller was far more catalyst than caretaker in a last-second 21-19 comeback win against the Houston Texans.
Ridder completed 28 of 37 attempts for a career-high 329 yards while tallying two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing) to power the offense. Long-awaited connections with his top targets in tight end Kyle Pitts (seven catches, 87 yards) and wide receiver Drake London (six catches, 78 yards) finally materialized. And he deftly navigated the final drive, completing all five of his passes for 44 yards to set up Younghoe Koo for the game-winning 37-yard field goal as time expired. Ridder's standing never seemed to be in question within the Falcons, but this outing gives the offense something to build on.
Maybe dispatching the Arizona Cardinals 34-20 in a get-right game doesn't completely undo the myriad setbacks the team suffered in its first four games, but the Bengals appear to be on a much steadier course now. Burrow finally looked fluid and comfortable, with much of his mobility seemingly having returned after the quarterback was hampered by a calf injury since the start of the season. And just one week after he explained in frustration that he's "always (expletive) open," Chase exploded for 15 catches, 192 yards and three touchdowns. The squeaky receiver gets the targets.
For all the histrionics about Cincinnati's start, the Bengals now stand at 2-3 with their star players seemingly back in a good place. There's still work to be done, but there's no reason to write this team off.
One of the more disappointing developments of September was the steadily building training camp buzz around Pickens – the Pittsburgh Steelers' ultra-promising second-year receiver – fading into a dull hum amid persistent woes plaguing his entire offense. For one week, at least, fans got a glimpse of the dynamic downfield threat that Pickens can be.
Trailing by four with just over two minutes remaining against the Baltimore Ravens, Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett found the 6-3, 200-pound target on a back-shoulder throw for a 21-yard gain. Two plays later, Pickens dusted Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey – who was playing in his first game back after August foot surgery – for a 41-yard go-ahead touchdown in a 17-10 triumph. It's probably not the kind of play that the Steelers faithful can routinely expect from oft-criticized offensive coordinator Matt Canada. But incorporating Pickens more can only help invigorate what has been a languishing attack.
Throughout most of his time with the Cowboys, McCarthy has pounced on opponents with a significant talent deficit, allowing composed offense and opportunistic and highly aggressive defense to take care of overmatched foes. On Sunday, he got a reminder of what it's like to be on the other side of that dynamic.
It's not clear if the Cowboys could have done much differently to have had a semblance of a chance in Sunday night's catastrophic outing against the 49ers. What is apparent: As both as a coach and a play-caller, McCarthy proved to be no match for Kyle Shanahan. Dak Prescott said his three-interception night might be "the most humbling game I've ever been a part of," and McCarthy's avowed commitment to "run the damn ball" produced a team total of 57 yards on 19 carries. In what was clearly designed to be a statement game for the Cowboys after the 49ers ended their playoff hopes in the past two seasons, Dallas was outclassed in almost every facet. What McCarthy can muster might be enough to beat up on the bottom and middle tiers of the NFC, but any notion of the Cowboys beating the 49ers – and potentially the Philadelphia Eagles – on the road in January seems like a distant dream.
Suffering the two most lopsided losses of his career in consecutive weeks has left Bill Belichick and the Patriots in a particularly inauspicious spot. But there's a special indignity in the manner in which New England has dropped to this point, a bespoke misery based on Belichick's specific buttons. At the root of it all is Jones, whose head-scratching pick-six to Tyrann Mathieu in a 34-0 rout by the New Orleans Saints was the quarterback's third of the season and second in as many games. That kind of carelessness is no doubt maddening to a coach who hammers fundamentals and sound ball security. But Belichick is not merely the victim here, as his slew of personnel mistakes over the last few years – as well as his befuddling offensive staffing decisions in 2022 – have severely hampered the third-year passer's development. After pulling Jones late again in Sunday's blowout, Belichick again stood by his starter. But this pairing is looking more tenuous with each week, and Jones might need to find mentorship elsewhere to get his career back on track.
It took a truly multifaceted meltdown for John Harbaugh and Co. to squander what should have been a decisive victory. The formerly maligned receiving corps had a throwback performance in the worst way possible, with Nelson Agholor and Rashod Bateman dropping surefire touchdowns. Lamar Jackson unraveled late in the fourth quarter with an interception that paved the way for Pittsburgh's comeback and a fumble that deflated any hopes for Baltimore's own rally. And prior to all that, a blocked punt for a safety helped spark a Steelers team that had been stagnant. 
The slip-up could prove costly in the long run. The Ravens had a chance to begin pulling away from the pack in the AFC North, but instead they fell into a first-place tie with Pittsburgh. 
Whatever mojo they had from last week's statement win over the Miami Dolphins must not have made it through customs for the overseas showdown with the Jaguars. The offense was imbalanced and error-prone. The defense was trampled for 29 first downs and 196 rushing yards. 
Most worrisome, however, were the mounting injuries. All-Pro linebacker and defensive linchpin Matt Milano is expected to be out for the season with what multiple outlets have reported is a fractured leg and a knee injury, and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones suffered a pectoral injury. On Sunday, Buffalo already started to see the effect of losing top cornerback Tre'Davious White for the year to a torn Achilles, with Jacksonville's receivers too often exploiting an overmatched secondary. If the Bills don't shore things up, this could be a harbinger of the franchise's fate against the AFC's contender class. 
There's still no reason to sound the alarm on a No. 1 pick who's just four starts into his professional career. Still, after the Detroit Lions' 42-24 win over the Carolina Panthers, it's difficult to watch Young operate in this offense without wincing. A highly questionable screen to tight end Ian Thomas that ended with defensive end Aidan Hutchinson snatching the ball in mid-air will spark the most exaggerated reactions, but chalk it up to a good play by a tremendously talented defender. The second of Young's two interceptions, however, was the real cause for concern, as cornerback Jerry Jacobs baited the typically discerning signal-caller into the kind of throw he avoided throughout his college career. The signs are troubling in Carolina, as there's scant support from the offensive line or running game, and the coaching staff seems to be doing Young few favors. While this season appears to be a write-off and one that should solely be measured by Young's development, substantial change might still be required at some point. 
CONCORD, N.H.−Ron DeSantis began a two-day New Hampshire swing Thursday by displaying a revamped campaign style that includes amped-up criticism of Donald Trump.
DeSantis focused on Trump's comments Wednesday criticizing the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netahnyahu and his government over the war with Hamas, and describing Hezbollah militants as "very smart."
"Now is not the time to be attacking our ally," DeSantis told supporters at the New Hampshire State House.
Several Republicans noted that, after the 2020 election, Trump attacked Netanyahu for hailing Biden as the president-elect.
"It’s clear he’s angry at Netanyahu for recognizing Trump lost in 2020," said a statement from Never Back Down, a pro-DeSantis political action committee. "Trump puts himself first."
What did Trump say about Netanyahu?Trump blames Netanyahu for Hamas attacks, calls Hezbollah leaders 'very smart'
DeSantis spoke after formally filing for January’s New Hampshire primary, a contest he declared “wide open” despite Trump’s huge lead in polls.
“If you want to change from Trump, I think I’m the best leader,” DeSantis said, adding that he gives Republicans “the best chance to be able to do well” in a general election.
DeSantis, who has seen his support erode after months of attacks from Trump, has gradually escalated counter-criticism of the former president throughout the campaign. He has been more pointed in recent days, part of a strategy adjustment that includes more interviews with mainstream media outlets.
The Florida governor plans to spend Thursday touring the northern part of the state along with members of his political action committee, Never Back Down.
He is scheduled to participate Friday in traditional events, including a "Politics and Eggs" breakfast hosted by the New Hampshire Institute of Politics.
DeSantis and other Republican candidates are scheduled to address the state Republican Party's "First in the Nation Leadership Summit" in Nashua, N.H. this weekend.
An Oct. 4 Facebook post (direct link, archive link) claims the sons of two well-known politicians are in legal trouble.
“Tagg Romney & Paul Pelosi, Jr. Children of Mitt Romney and Nancy Pelosi are now under criminal investigation for business dealing in Ukraine’s Bursima Energy (sic),” reads the post.  It was later updated to attribute the information to Newsmax.
The post was shared more than 250 times in two days. Another version of the post was shared more than 13,000 times on X, formerly Twitter.

This is wrong on multiple fronts. There is no evidence that Tagg Romney or Paul Pelosi Jr. are connected to the Ukrainian energy company Burisma at all. And, accordingly, there is no evidence of any criminal investigation along those lines.
President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden sat on the board of Burisma from 2014 to 2019. Some Republicans have claimed then-Vice President Joe Biden wrongfully used his power to force the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the company, but a 2020 Senate investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the president.
There is no evidence that the children of Utah Sen. Mitt Romney or former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi were involved with the company. And there's no evidence of any investigation involving the two.
The Department of Justice has made no announcement of any such investigation, and no credible news outlets have reported on a probe involving Tagg Romney and Paul Pelosi Jr.
There is also no evidence that Newsmax reported on the supposed probe into the two men. Newsmax did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Facebook post is a new variation of a long-running claim of ties between Ukraine and the sons of various politicians.
USA TODAY in 2021 debunked the similar claim that Tagg Romney and Paul Pelosi Jr., as well as the sons of President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State John Kerry, were all on the board of directors for energy companies doing business in Ukraine. Only Hunter Biden has worked for a Ukranian company.
Fact check: Mitt Romney announced he won't seek reelection in 2024, but he's not resigning
Former President Donald Trump tried to connect Mitt Romney to Burisma in 2020 after the senator voted to impeach Trump related to efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rivals in exchange for military aid, as reported by POLITICO. The allegation was made on the grounds that an advisor from Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign was on the company’s board of directors.
There is no evidence that Tagg Romney or Paul Pelosi, Jr. have worked for Ukrainian companies.
Drew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi's former deputy chief of staff, told USA TODAY in 2020 that claims of a relationship between Paul Pelosi, Jr. and Burisma Holdings were "completely false." USA TODAY reached out to the Department of Justice and the offices of Mitt Romney and Nancy Pelosi for comment but did not receive a response.
Paul Pelosi, Jr., Nancy's Pelosi's son, has been involved with various companies throughout his business career, as mentioned in a 2012 Securities and Exchange Commission filing. He at one point was a board member for Viscoil Holdings LLC, an energy company based in California that later reorganized under a new name. In 2021, Paul Pelosi Jr. became president of EVSK Corp., a Canada-based company focused on electric vehicle battery recycling.
Tagg Romney, Mitt Romney's eldest son, co-founded the private equity investment firm Solamere Capital in 2008. The company is based in Boston and also has an office in New York.
Outlets including Reuters and PolitiFact also debunked claims of Nancy Pelosi and Mitt Romney’s supposed connections to Ukrainian energy companies.

Donald Trump lashed out at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling a crowd of Florida supporters that the countries' intelligence failed, and its enemies were ''very smart."
"I'll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down," Trump told a group of supporters Wednesday in West Palm Beach, Fla. "That was a very terrible thing."
Trump discussed the operation that killed Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani in early 2020. The former president said Israel now has to strengthen itself as it fights Hamas and other militant groups, including perhaps Iran.
Supporters of Israel said on social media said that the Soleimani operation was aided by Israeli intelligence, while others criticized Trump for criticizing Israel's government in the midst of a crisis.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running against Trump for the Republican nomination, zeroed in on Trump's description of Hezbollah leaders as "very smart."
Noting that at least 1,200 Israelis and 22 Americans have been killed in recent days, DeSantis said on the X website that "it is absurd that anyone, much less someone running for President, would choose now to attack our friend and ally, Israel, much less praise Hezbollah terrorists as 'very smart.' As President, I will stand with Israel and treat terrorists like the scum that they are."
During what was otherwise a campaign speech, Trump claimed that an unnamed U.S. official described Israel as being vulnerable from the north, and that kind of information would be helpful to adversaries.
"You know, Hezbollah is very smart - they're all very smart," Trump said at one point.
Trump also criticized Netanyahu in an interview on Fox News Radio, saying Israel was ill-prepared for the Hamas attack earlier this month.
"He has been hurt very badly because of what’s happened here," Trump told Brian Kilmeade of Fox News Radio. "He was not prepared. He was not prepared, and Israel was not prepared."
Trump even linked the Israel attack to his false claims of a "rigged" U.S. election in 2020, and said the attack on Israel would not have happened if he was president.
Several Republicans noted that, after the 2020 election, Trump attacked Netanyahu for hailing Biden as the president-elect.
"It’s clear he’s angry at Netanyahu for recognizing Trump lost in 2020," said a statement from Never Back Down, a pro-DeSantis political action committee. " Trump puts himself first."
On the X social media site, the organization Republicans against Trump said: "As President Biden and the entire world stand in solidarity with Israel after the worst terrorist attack in Israel’s history, Donald Trump has decided to attack Israel and its military. Unfit for office."
Democrats denounced Trump’s comments.
White House spokesman Andrew Bates said that while “we don’t comment” on the 2024 races, “statements like this are dangerous and unhinged.”
Bates added: “It’s completely lost on us why any American would ever praise an Iran-backed terrorist organization as ‘’smart.’ Or have any objection to the United States warning terrorists not to attack Israel. Especially now as Israel is fighting back against one of the worst acts of mass murder in the country’s history. This is a time for all of us to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel against ‘unadulterated evil.’ That’s what the President is doing as commander in chief.”
Trump's comments came during a rambling 100-minute speech in which he didn't say anything about his involvement in the snagged House Speaker's race, but instead predicted he would succeed in next year's presidential election.
"Everyone knows what the result is going to be," the former president told supporters gathered in West Palm Beach, Fla.
Last week, Trump injected himself into the speaker's race by endorsing Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. He also said he would travel to Washington, D.C., to meet with House Republicans about replacing ousted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.
Trump did not go to Washington and Jordan fell short in balloting among House Republicans who favored House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.
It is not yet Scalise's job. A number of House Republicans said they would continue to support Jordan, denying Scalise a necessary majority in a full House vote that includes Democrats.
Trump did not discuss any of this during his campaign speech. He mentioned Jordan's name only in connection with his work in Congress.
He also praised Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., the most outspoken member of the eight House Republicans who triggered McCarthy's removal as speaker.
For the most part, Trump focused on his own 2024 presidential campaign before a group called Club 47 USA. If Trump wins next year, he would be the 47th president, only the second to serve non-consecutive terms.
The standard campaign speech featured all-out attacks on President Joe Biden, with an emphasis to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. He also hit Biden over the economy, his son Hunter Biden, and border security.
Trump, as is custom, also bragged about poll numbers that show him way ahead of his Republican rivals for the 2024 presidential nomination. He mocked his opponents for debating without him, and said Republican voters are not paying attention to them.
"Everyone knows what the result is going to be," Trump said.
He also complained about his legal issues. He faces four criminal trials and three civil lawsuits The criminal cases include hush money, the handling of classified information, and efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden.
EXETER, N.H. — The inaugural series of 2024 Republican presidential town halls in Exeter, New Hampshire, hosted by Seacoastonline, USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network, will feature former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley Thursday evening.
She will take questions from voters at 6:30 p.m. ET. Doors open at 5:30 p.m. ET.
The former governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is trailing behind former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in some polls among Republican voters, but she has led other GOP rivals, including former Vice President Mike Pence and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
Ahead of her town hall, here are five things to know about Haley.
Haley served as a South Carolina state lawmaker from 2005 to 2011 and governor of the Palmetto State from 2011 to 2017. She has frequently touted her local political credentials on the campaign trail. 
As a state representative, Haley pushed for more transparency in local government and spearheaded efforts to require more roll call votes from state lawmakers, effectively forcing lawmakers' positions to be publicly recorded.
Haley, after becoming governor, eventually signed a law mandating more roll call votes.
Haley was serving as governor during the 2015 Charleston church shooting, when a white supremacist shot and killed nine worshippers at the Emanuel AME Church, a historically Black church. 
At the time, the Confederate flag had flown on the South Carolina State House grounds for 77 years, but following the shooting, Haley signed a bill lowering the flag in one of her most significant acts as governor.
Haley also served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under former President Donald Trump’s administration and has sought to make her foreign policy credentials front and center on the campaign trail. 
At other town halls, Haley often says she took the “kick me” sign off America’s back in the United Nations. 
And as skepticism about continued U.S. aid to Ukraine grows in the GOP, Haley is one of the Republican Party’s most vocal defenders of Ukraine, arguing that “a win for Russia is a win for China.”
On the debate stage Haley has been eager to hammer her opponents on foreign policy. The former U.N. ambassador went after entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for his opposition to continued U.S. aid to Ukraine. 
In a crowded presidential field dominated by Trump, Haley has sought to make the argument she is the candidate best fit to defeat President Joe Biden in a general election matchup. 
In a race solely between Biden and Haley, the former South Carolina governor beat out the sitting president by 5 points, 41%-46%, according to a poll conducted by NBC News in September. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
Haley’s campaign has not shied away from touting her polling performance against Biden. 
“Nikki Haley stands apart as the only candidate who handily beats Joe Biden in the general election,” the campaign said in a statement in September. 
The former South Carolina governor has run, as she described to USA TODAY in an interview in May, a “slow and steady campaign.”
“This is a marathon, it’s not a sprint. I’m not concerned with where things are now. I’m concerned about touching as many voters as we can and watching that go,” Haley said. “It’s slow and steady wins the race.”
While Trump remains the frontrunner of the 2024 GOP primary, Haley’s slow and steady campaign could be bearing fruit. She has seen her support among likely GOP voters surge after her debate performances. 
In New Hampshire, a critical early voting state, Haley rose to second place behind Trump in a Suffolk University/Boston Globe/USA TODAY poll, at 19% support. The former president still holds a commanding lead at 49%, but in the Granite State, at least, Haley appears to be Trump’s primary rival. 
Following the second Republican primary debate, Trump went after Haley as “Birdbrain Nikki Haley,” on Truth Social, his social media platform.
Haley took Trump’s attack in stride, writing in a post on X, formerly Twitter, “Love this. It means we are in 2nd and moving up fast. Bring it!” 
Haley also stands out from the rest of the pack as the only woman in the GOP presidential field. She has occasionally mentioned that status on the campaign trail, telling voters that it is time to elect a woman to the White House.
The presidential hopeful has noted she is uniquely fit to reach out to women voters, compared to the other 2024 candidates. 
“I know the challenges they face. I know whether they’re taking care of elderly parents because I’m doing that. I know about their spouses in the military. I’m a military wife. I know about that,” Haley told USA TODAY. “I know about raising children and the concerns you have.”
Inflation is headed in the right direction but the road remains bumpy.
Consumer price increases stayed high in September after picking up over the summer as steady gains in rent and other services offset another decline in used car prices and a smaller rise in gasoline and food costs.
Consumer prices overall rose 3.7% from a year earlier, similar to August's increase, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. 
On a monthly basis, prices increased 0.4% following a 0.6% rise in August that was fueled by a surge in pump prices.
Protect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023
Core prices, which strip out volatile food and energy items and which the Federal Reserve watches more closely as it weighs interest rate changes, remained high. They rose 0.3% last month after 0.2% bumps over the summer. The advance still lowered the annual increase to 4.1% from 4.3% in August, marking the smallest gain since September 2021.
Annual inflation has slowed significantly after hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, including a sharp drop to 3% in the first half of 2023. But since then, the cost of some goods and services has accelerated or pulled back more slowly, pushing up the yearly rise.
Prices for items such as used cars and furniture have dropped as pandemic-related supply-chain snarls have been resolved. But the cost of services such as rent, car repairs and auto insurance, have continued to drift higher in part because of briskly rising employee wages.
As a result, driving down inflation to the Fed’s annual 2% target is becoming a tougher slog. Barclays expects inflation broadly to dip to 3.3% in December and 2.6% at the end of 2024. Core price gains are projected to drift down to 3.7% at the end of the year and 2.8% at the close of 2024.
Barclays expects the Fed to raise its key interest rate once more this year, by a quarter percentage point, after lifting it by 5.25 points in 16 months.
But other economists say tumbling wholesale costs will prompt a faster pullback in inflation.
"Overall, there is nothing here that will convince Fed officials to hike rates at the next...meeting, and we continue to expect a more rapid decline in inflation and weaker economic growth to result in rates being cut much more aggressively next year than markets are pricing in," says economist Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics.
Stocks were mixed in late morning trading as investors digested the uncertain odds of another Fed rate increase. The Dow Jones industrial average was down about 70 points, or 0.21% while the S&P 500 index was up 2 points or 0.05%.
Households, meanwhile, are still struggling. Although price increases are moderating, costs are still high and many Americans say they aren’t feeling much relief. 
Stanley Novack, 78, of Valencia, California, says he’s most frustrated by high gas and grocery costs. “It’s out there, wherever you go,” says Novack, who is semi-retired and works part-time as a hotel and restaurant consultant. “We’re not seeing it easing at all.”
He says he pays $6.50 a gallon for gas in California and as much as $135 for weekly groceries for him and his wife, up from $100 before the pandemic. “You just have to deal with it,” he says.
Gasoline prices rose 2.1% in September after surging 10.6% the previous month and they’re up 3% from a year earlier. Pump prices are well below their $5 peak in summer 2022 and are likely move lower in the short term following the busy summer driving season despite the Israel-Hamas war, which has pushed up oil prices.
Grocery prices rose more modestly, inching up 0.1% and lowering the yearly increase to 2.4%. The cost of commodities such as wheat and corn generally have fallen as major producers Ukraine and Russia have found alternative shipping routes that skirt their 18-month war.
Last month, the price of breakfast cereal fell 0.5%, while rice and fish both slid 1.3%.
But some proteins moved higher. Bacon rose 4.8% following a 4% rise in August; uncooked ground beef increased 0.6%; and eggs jumped 0.9% after a string of declines.
Rent, which has been the biggest inflation driver, rose a sturdy 0.5% for the second straight month, though that’s down from a spate of stronger gains. That nudged up the yearly rise to 7.4%. Economists expect rent increases to pull back, based on new leases, but that shift has been slow to filter through to existing leases.
Generally, the pattern of rising service costs fueled by healthy wage growth and falling goods prices continued last month.
Car repair costs rose 0.2%; auto insurance climbed 1.3%; and hotel rates leaped 3.7%. A key measure of service costs, excluding housing, that the Fed is following closely jumped 0.6%, says Nationwide economist Kathy Bostjancic
Meanwhile, used car prices fell 2.5%; clothing dropped 0.8%; and furniture declined 1.2% as supply chain troubles eased further.
USA TODAY explores the questions you and others ask about inflation and how it affects your life, from "What is inflation?" to "What happens during a recession?" For more answers to your questions about today's report and other economic trends, keep reading:
Social Security recipients will get 3.2% more in their checks next year, a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, based on Thursday's consumer price report showing that annual overall inflation remained at the same level as the previous month.
The 3.7% rise in overall prices is nearly twice the 2% target favored by the Federal Reserve. But inflation has been mostly trending down, leading to the modest Social Security COLA increase.
Major differences, according to the Cleveland Fed, are:
The Fed raised its key rate at 10 meetings in a row starting in March 2022, the most aggressive run of rate hikes in four decades. It paused that streak in June, leaving the benchmark federal funds rate where it stood, but implemented another increase the following month lifting the rate by a quarter point to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. 
The federal funds rate is what banks pay each other for overnight loans. If that rate rises, banks typically pass along that extra cost, meaning it becomes more expensive to borrow as rates increase on services and items ranging from credit cards to home equity lines. That’s why the funds rate is the primary tool used by the Federal Reserve to try and put the brakes on inflation.  
When it costs more to borrow, businesses and consumers are less inclined to do it, and that means an overheated economy can cool and price increases may slow. 
The Fed’s policy arm meets next on Oct. 31-Nov. 1. It will announce its interest rate decision at 2 P.M. ET on Nov. 1.
The Fed’s final meeting of the year is Dec. 12-13.
The inflation rate has plunged, tumbling by more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June, 2022. But it’s still above the 2% target preferred by the Federal Reserve. Here's where the U.S. inflation rate has stood each month since May 2022:
The Federal Reserve watches two key measures of the economy, price stability and maximum employment, which are its main considerations in interest-rate decisions.  The CPI gives the Fed guidance to assess whether prices are “stable.’’
CPI is also used to inflation-adjust things like Social Security payments and income tax brackets. It’s also the reference rate for some financial contracts, such as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). 
Core prices leave out volatile food and energy items and therefore are a more accurate reflection of longer-term trends.
September used car prices likely fell at least 2% from the prior month, while energy prices recorded a modest increase of 0.4% after a 5.6% jump in August, said Stephen Juneau, U.S. economist at Bank of America. Retail gasoline prices, he said, were nearly flat last month.
Goldman Sachs economists forecast a 2.3% decline in used car prices and a 0.1% dip in new car prices last month.
Renters are still getting squeezed. Goldman Sachs economists see rents up 0.48% on the month, rising at about a steady pace. Shelter inflation, which includes home prices, rents and other lodging, comprises about a third of the consumer price index (CPI). However, Goldman says 
Airfares are also expected to post a gain, some economists noted. 
It depends on the data.
The CME Fed watch tool that helps gauge the market’s expectation for a rate move puts the chances of a Fed rate hike at only 10%, but economists aren’t yet fully ruling one out, partly because the labor market remains strong. A strong job market puts money in people’s pockets, which can fuel spending and inflation.
“With the surprisingly-strong September job report intensifying the debate on the further hikes, the near-term policy trajectory will be highly sensitive to Thursday’s CPI,” Deutsche Bank economists said in a note.
The last time the Fed met in September, it held rates steady at a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% but signaled another hike is likely this year amid still elevated inflation and a sturdy economy.
“Broadly, stronger economic activity means we have to do more with rates,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters then. 
He also said, separately, “we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.”
CPI measures inflation as experienced by consumers going about their day-to-day lives, while the PPI, or producer price index, measures the average changes over time in the sale prices received by domestic producers for their output. PPI, often referred to as wholesale price inflation, is gleaned during an  earlier phase of the production and marketing cycle and typically impacts CPI. 
Core inflation, which assesses inflation but leaves out the more volatile prices of food and energy, is the other key price metric.  
In bonds, the 10-year Treasury yield, which tends to rise if inflation accelerates, was 4.64%, up a modest 0.046 points.
Social Security recipients found out Thursday how much of a raise they will get next year. That’s because the consumer price index report contains data the Social Security Administration (SSA) uses to determine the cost-of-living adjustment or COLA for 2024. 
Those payments will go up 3.2%. 
The annual overall inflation rate is currently 3.7%, but is expected to have slid by a tenth of a point in September.  
Inflation is a "generalized rise in prices," according to Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C. The cost of items and services ranging from health care, to gas, to groceries can shift depending on inflation.  
When there are too few goods to meet the demand, prices are likely to rise, according to Investopedia. That disparity is called demand pull inflation. 
The Department of Labor has a tool that enables consumers to find out shifts in their buying power.   
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) looks at the average change in prices for particular products and services over a period of time, according to the Bureau of Labor Services.
It’s one inflation measure that the Fed and the economist use as a barometer to gauge price stability. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or PCE, prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The next PCE report for September is due Oct. 27.

Wages vs. inflation:US wage growth is finally outpacing inflation. Many Americans aren't feeling it.
Most of us seem to know that the average American lives between 70 and 80 years: 73.5 years for men, 79.3 for women, to be exact.
Fewer of us understand that life expectancy rises with age. An American man who turns 70 today will live to 85, on average. A woman of 70 will live to 87. 
That knowledge is called longevity literacy. Many of us don’t have it, and ignorance may cost us.
Let's say a man retires at 65 with $250,000 in savings. If he spends it down at a rate of $30,000 a year, the money might last him to age 73.5. But longevity tables say he can expect to live another decade, to 84.
A large share of older Americans, and especially men, don’t know how long their own retirement is going to last: in other words, how long they are going to live.
Longevity literacy matters when it comes to retirement planning. If your retirement budget assumes you will live to 75, and you make it to 85, you will probably run out of money.
“Moving into retirement, you have to think about, ‘When am I going to die?’” said Paul Yakoboski, a senior economist at the TIAA Institute, the research arm of the financial-services nonprofit. “That filters back on how I’m managing my money, how I’m drawing it down.”
The TIAA Institute publishes widely read surveys on retirement finance. When the institute asked Americans, in a recent survey, how long a man of 65 is likely to live, only one-third of the men gave the correct answer: 19 more years.
A larger share of men in the TIAA survey, 35%, underestimated the lifespan of a retirement-age male. Another 23% said they didn’t know. That response, in particular, left researchers bewildered: the question was multiple-choice.
Women seem to understand longevity somewhat better. In the survey, 36% correctly answered that a woman of 65 can expect to live about 22 more years, to age 87. Only 26% guessed low.
“Women just have a better grasp on that,” Yakoboski said. “The reality of most households, it’s the woman who focuses on the healthcare in the family and everybody’s wellbeing and caregiving issues.”
Their findings draw on a nationally representative survey of 3,503 adults.
Luigi Ferrucci is 69. According to official CDC data for human longevity, men live to about 74, which would give Ferrucci another five years.
But Ferrucci works at the National Institute on Aging, and he knows about longevity. If an American male reaches age 69, he can expect to live to 85, according to a simple longevity calculator from the Social Security Administration.
Ferrucci expects to live longer than that.
“My mother died at the age of 97, and my father died at the age of 98,” both in Italy, said Ferrucci, scientific director at the federal agency. He credits good genes and the Mediterranean diet.
The human lifespans reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are “calculated at birth,” Ferrucci said. Those are the numbers most Americans learn in school, the ones reported in the newspaper every year.
But life expectancy goes up from there. Simply put: The longer you do live, the longer you will live.
“Mortality is very high in the first year of life, and then declines, and then tends to increase gradually,” Ferrucci said.
TIAA has made longevity literacy something of an institutional crusade, putting out reports that warn of dire consequences for older Americans who do not plan for the full span of their retirement.
“You look at the numbers, there’s a good chance someone at 67 is going to be alive at 90,” Yakoboski said, speaking in a video conference call interview. “Some of those people are going to be alive at 100.”
His colleague, Andrea Sticha, chimed in: “The decision you have to make is whether to outlive your money or leave something behind.” Sticha is deputy academic director of the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center at Stanford University.
The takeaway here is twofold, the researchers said: Figure out how long you are going to live, and make sure you have a retirement plan that covers those years.
The TIAA researchers have noticed that people with strong longevity literacy, about 12% of the population, are more likely than other adults to have a retirement plan. Conversely, people with a solid retirement plan tend to understand how long they will live. The two traits go hand in hand.
“Individuals with better longevity literacy do a better job planning and saving for retirement,” Sticha said. “There’s a very strong link between longevity literacy and retirement outcomes.”
Here are a few simple tips for retirement planning:
Sticha and Yakoboski collaborated with researcher Annamaria Lusardi on an August TIAA report on longevity literacy.
The scholars are alarmed that so many adults underestimate how long they will live. If anything, people should err in the opposite direction. If you are 65 now and expect to reach 85, plan for 90.
How much money do you need to retire?Most Americans calculate $1.8 million, survey says.
Roughly half of Americans have at least attempted to calculate how much money they will need to live comfortably in retirement, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute's 2023 Retirement Confidence Survey.
And how much should you save for retirement? One analysis, from the investment firm T. Rowe Price, suggests a savings target of seven to 13 times your annual salary by age 65.
The EBRI survey found that only 64% of workers believe they will have the funds to last through retirement. The figure declined sharply over the past year. Americans are worried about nagging inflation and sagging retirement savings, which took a hit in 2022. The average 401(k) account lost about one-fifth of its value last year, according to Fidelity Investments data.
Budgeting for retirement is more important than ever, said Craig Copeland, director of wealth benefits research at EBRI, because more Americans are setting the budget themselves.
In decades past, many American retirees relied primarily on Social Security and defined-benefit pensions, funding sources that guaranteed steady payments until death.
Over time, the traditional pension has given way to the 401 (k) and other defined-contribution plans. Upon retirement, the worker sets the schedule for withdrawing the money.
“Longevity,” Copeland said, “is the key factor in that equation.”
We all have to face the prospect of aging at some point. We prepare for this reality for years in advance, starting 401ks, contributing to Medicare and Social Security as well as comparing insurance plans.
For many Americans, the goal is to have ample healthcare, a nest egg to retire on and the ability to age peacefully at home.
According to a new survey conducted between January and February of 2022, however, these goals are not being equally obtained by all. Conducted with 2,227 random Americans aged 50 to 80 online or via phone, the survey found that Black citizens were less likely to achieve aging in place.
This is thanks to a variety of factors, with the two most significant being self-reported disability status and income.
Social security changes:Why October 12 is a big day for Social Security recipients
Led by Sheria Robinson-Lane, assistant professor in the department of systems, populations and leadership with the University of Michigan's School of Nursing in Ann Arbor, the study published Oct. 4 in journal Geriatric Nursing found that nearly one third of adults aged 50–80 (30.9%) reported currently living with a disability.
Black adults experienced the highest rate of disability at 40% as well as higher rates of "fair" or "poor" physical health at 37.1% versus 20.9% overall.
Black households were also more likely to report having a family member with a disability present with 36.4% compared to the overall sample of 23.3%. Half of Black households also reported an income lower than $30,000 a year, a significant discrepancy from the quarter of overall respondents who reported the same thing (23.3%).
Older Black Americans are also more likely to live alone, with 44.1% reporting they were the only one in their home versus a quarter of overall respondents. This, paired with the aforementioned factors, cumulate in Black adults having lower rates of confidence in their ability to afford and find necessary in-home care.
How does all of this prevent Black Americans from aging at home? First and foremost, said the study's authors, increased rates of disability mean more strain on already thinly stretched resources.
Older adults with disabilities often require some form of assistive device, human support or other accommodations. The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services' Administration on Aging found that on average, 70% of people 65 and up need some type of long-term care, such as a nursing home or assisted living, at some point, while 20% will need that care for more than five years.
Women face microaggressions at work:We need to talk about the macro effect of microaggressions on women at work
With assisted living costs averaging at $4,500 per month and nursing homes averaging $7,908-$9,034 per month for a semi-private room or private room according to Genworth Financial's 2021 Cost of Care Survey, support for older people is in no way cheap.
In-home care is pricey as well, with median prices hovering between $4,957 to $5,148 per month for homemaker services or a home health aide, according to the same 2021 data. In the same year, more than half of Americans had less than $250 left at the end of the month after paying necessary bills.
With older Black Americans more likely to shoulder the weight of higher healthcare costs due to disability, more likely to live alone without in-home familial assistance and more likely to grapple with an income under $30,000, they face multiple barriers to aging in their own home and communities.
Within the overall sample, 41.3% of respondents were not confident they could afford supportive care such as assistance with chores, shopping, personal care or finance management if needed. Facing down the existing cost-of-living crisis, many older Americans have found themselves without means to live comfortably or access necessary resources.
In an already difficult fiscal climate, ethnic and racial discrepancies continue to impact quality of care for our older population. According to the study's authors, healthcare facilities placing a focus on adapting and optimizing care to close these gaps is an important course of action to begin addressing the disparity.
"Aging in place requires a proactive individual and community-based approach that facilitates older adult independence and connects adults with the social, clinical, and environmental support needed to remain in one's home for as long as possible," the study said.
Your favorite Tex-Mex fast casual spot may no longer be much of a bargain compared to a sit-down restaurant meal.
Chipotle confirmed to USA TODAY that consumers will soon see a hike in menu prices, the fourth such increase in just two years. Laurie Schalow, Chipotle’s chief corporate affairs officer, attributed the change to the state of the economy, citing inflation as the culprit.
“For the first time in over a year, we will be taking a modest price increase to offset inflation,” she said in an email statement. Chipotle declined to comment further or clarify what or when menu items will be impacted.
The chain's last price increase came in August 2022 when some customers began paying $1 or more additional for the same menu items as before. Before this, Chipotle increased prices about 3.5 to 4% in June of 2021, citing a raise in employee wages, and then again in the first quarter of 2022, also around 4%.

Despite apparently rising costs, Chipotle's 2023 second quarter report saw a 13.6% increase in revenue year over year, bringing the overall number to $2.5 billion. The eatery also opened 47 new restaurants with 40 locations including a Chipotlane drive thru. The ongoing success and rising profits indicate that, at least up to this point, customers are not significantly deturbed by the frequent price revisions.
While inflation is finally moving in a better direction, consumer prices this month still rose overall 3.7% from earlier years after hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.
Faced with the reality of everything costing more, it may be that Tex-Mex fans are willing to pay a little extra for the luxury of a burrito with some queso and guac on the side for the time being.

Over the last year, inflation has been cooling. But from the gas pump to the grocery store, the overall price of living still feels stubbornly high for many Americans.
The Federal Reserve has tried to strike a fragile balance: bring inflation down by raising interest rates, without pushing the economy to the brink.
In August, consumer prices rose 3.7% from a year earlier, up from a 3.2% increase in July. That’s the second straight rise after 12 consecutive declines in annual inflation.
The next consumer price index, or CPI report, will be published on October 12, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The monthly update provides key information on the prices of various consumer goods and services and how much they have risen over the past month and year. The data also gives an idea of whether inflation is slowing again or accelerating.
While it is easy to see and measure those price changes, it is something else to actually understand them. Inflation can impact many things besides costs, such as employment and wages. 
So, what is inflation, and what causes it? 
Ready to retire? How much money do you need and when you should start to save
Inflation is a "generalized rise in prices," said Josh Bivens, the director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C. For example, goods like gas, rent or food can be impacted by inflation. 
"Inflation, though, really is meant to only refer to all goods and services, together, rising in price by some common amount," he explained. 
Inflation can be caused by several factors. The most common is "a macroeconomic excess of spending over the economy's relative ability to produce goods and services," Bivens said. 
In this instance, more people are spending money on goods or services that are not readily available to meet those demands, so producers begin to raise prices.
"If everyone in the economy, tomorrow, decided they weren't going to save any money from their paychecks, and they're just going to spend every last dollar out of the blue, they would all run to the stores and try to buy things," Bivens said. "But, producers haven't produced enough to accommodate that big surge of across-the-board spending. So, you would see prices bid up." 
Another cause of inflation is a lack of producers. If there are not enough workers to produce the demanded good or service, this would lead to an increase in prices as well, Bivens said.
"Labor is the primary component of cost of producing anything," he explained. 
There is also a level of "built-in inflation" within economies, where central banks try to get inflation to hover roughly at a certain level.
In the U.S., the Federal Reserve's target inflation is 2%. This means businesses can increase prices by 2% each year, and it shouldn't impose a cost burden on consumers. Workers can also ask for a 2% wage raise based on these increases, so they can still afford goods and services. 
"That 2% is kind of the built-in inflation; what everyone expects to happen," Bivens said.
Rent inflation:Tenants struggle with rising rent as prices hit all-time highs
CPI stands for the consumer price index. It is a metric used by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to gauge how much the price of consumer goods and services has changed over time.
It can effectively measure inflation in an urban market and give government officials and everyday citizens alike an idea of the health of the overall economy.
The most recent CPI report, released in early August, showed that consumer prices in July rose 3.2% from a year earlier, up from a 3% annual rise in June but far below a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022. Month over month, prices increased a modest 0.2%, similar to June.
In the most basic sense, inflation is measured by comparing the current price of goods and services against their recent history.
This is done by looking at a number of government-released data reports.
The CPI is the most prominent of these metrics. Released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index measures the prices of goods in an urban market, which represents over 90% of the American public.
The CPI looks at a 'fixed basket' of some 80,000 goods and services to come up with these numbers. What gets put in that basket depends on the consumer expenditures survey which polls Americans to determine which goods are important. The importance of those goods then determines their weight in the CPI– for example, the price of something like gasoline, which forms an integral part of many people’s cost of living, will contribute more than other items.
The CPI does not just have one version though.
Another version – the chained consumer price Index for all urban consumers is used to adjust tax brackets. The virtue of the chained CPI is that it takes into account the product substitutions shoppers make, which happens often when prices go up amid inflation. In doing this, it provides a more accurate look at consumer spending and doesn’t overstate inflation.
Inflation can also be measured through the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE). This metric, released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, takes a more holistic view. Rather than calculating the change in prices for goods paid solely out of pocket for consumers, the PCE takes into account all expenses, including health care coverage compensated by insurance or the government.
The PCE is what the Fed uses as its gold standard measure of inflation.
The final piece of the puzzle to factor in is ‘core inflation.’ This is a term used by economists to reflect the rate of inflation, excluding prices for food and energy which are notoriously variable.
Inflation is both good and bad, Bivens said. However if rates of inflation are consistent, positive and low, they can be beneficial, he added. 
"Inflation is sort of greasing the wheels of the labor market," he said. "It is a way to do some adjustments without actually having to cut nominal wages, and the economy just seems to operate better like that."
If inflation goes beyond its target percentage, though, it can cause uncertainty within the market. 
"Whatever your target is, you don't want to go really far above that. You want people to be able to make plans and have a predictable sense of how much prices and wages will rise over the next year," Bivens said.
In order to control inflation, one of the Federal Reserve's main tools is the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. If that rate rises, banks generally pass on their additional cost to customers.
Even though the Fed does not directly control all interest rates in the country, when it raises the fed funds rate, other interest rates eventually follow, including adjustable-rate mortgages, credit cards, home equity lines of credit, and other loans.
Higher rates curb borrowing and spending, cool off an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes.
Whoever is spending most on goods or services can be negatively impacted by inflation. 
For instance, when gas or food prices are inflated, low- and moderate-income families are hurt since they spend a higher share of total income on energy and food, said Bivens. 
Inflation and recession are strongly related, said Bivens. 
High inflation can cause consumers to cut spending and prompt the Fed to raise interest rates - both of which can lead to a downturn. That can result in easing price increases.
"A big rise in the unemployment rate is going to put a lot of downward pressure on inflation," he said. "As the economy slows, inflationary pressures tend to relent." 
A recession isn’t determined by a negative quarter of gross domestic product or even two for that matter. Rather, it’s a significant decline in economic activity resulting from several factors, including high unemployment, a slowdown of goods produced and sold, and wages falling in addition to negative GDP readings.
That’s according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which gives the official ruling on when a U.S. recession starts and ends.
So, inflation could produce a recession, but it is not a definite outcome.
Consumers were rocked by surging food prices last year. In July, the cost of groceries rose 0.3%. This, however, still pushed down the yearly increase to 3.6%.
The price of rice and bread both rose 0.9%, uncooked ground beef increased 1.5% while cookies rose 0.8%.
Chicken and fish prices both fell 1.1%, bacon was down 0.7% and eggs declined 2.2%. This was the fifth straight monthly decrease for eggs after a series of sharp bird flu-related increases, and costs are now down 13.7% over the last year.
Costs to dine out are up 7.1% over the past year.
Much like other aspects of the economy, inflation can cause a raise in prices for rent as well. And in May, housing costs were the biggest contributor to inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
However, increases have somewhat slowed down. Rent went up 0.4% in July but this is less than previous stronger increases. Annually, rent eased to 8%, according to the CPI report.
The consumer price index, or CPI, measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a variety of different consumer goods and services, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Core prices exclude volatile food and energy items and generally provide a better measure of longer-term trends. 
They were up 0.2% in July. This left the annual increase at 4.7%, down just slightly from June’s 4.8% increase and well above the Fed's 2% target.
Since he was young, Christian Yu, better known as DPR IAN, has always dreamed big.
"I was always the one to be very on the edge, very adventurous, and I don't think that's ever disappeared," the 33-year-old says. "I've always liked to imagine a lot."
This imaginative nature has manifested throughout DPR IAN's life, making its mark in his work as a singer-songwriter, director and creative. IAN's latest EP "Dear Insanity...", out now, captures his essence as a storyteller, diving deeper into the expansive universe he creates within his music.
"For me, this whole EP just encompasses a journey into your consciousness," he says.
IAN was born and raised in Australia. Though he is currently based in Los Angeles, IAN is one of several artists under Dream Perfect Regime, or DPR, which based in Seoul, South Korea.
Since its inception, the collective has become known worldwide for its dynamic multimedia work and roster of talent, with IAN serving as its chief director and editor. In 2021, IAN released his debut EP "Moodswings in This Order", followed by his first studio album "Moodswings inTo Order" in 2022.  
IAN's ethos is personified by his creativity. Through his releases, IAN has meticulously constructed his own universe, which he calls "The Other Side."
He has come to represent his mental health through the personas "MITO" and "Mr. Insanity," with the former serving as the "the main attraction" of his discography, says IAN. His second EP "Dear Insanity..." expands the story of MITO and Mr. Insanity, chronicling the artist's introspection.
The seven tracks on "Dear Insanity..." detail IAN's journey as each acts as a "snapshot" into certain moments of his life.
When IAN was a teenager, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This has influenced his creative work, with it serving as an outlet and extension of himself.
"MITO represents my manic lows and Mr. Insanity had to rebuttal that, so representing my manic highs," he said.
He likens this to Batman and the Joker.
"You understand the Joker more by looking at Batman and seeing it through his eyes of how he sees the Joker and vice versa," IAN says. He wanted to do the same for MITO and Mr. Insanity, building a foundation between the two.
"For me, it's to have people further understand who MITO is," he says. "I had to show them what he was fighting up against."
Storytelling is a key aspect to IAN's work, whether it be visually or sonically. With this, he opens the door for deeper understanding of his past.
"The deeper you go in, I sometimes feel like there are certain things that you unravel, that you had no idea about," he says.
IAN portrays this unraveling in a fanciful, inventive way with bright visuals, as well as via distinct tones and genres. This underscores the intricate approach of IAN's art. Everything has its link and can be drawn back to an earlier point.
"I've always loved being taken on a journey because essentially that means you're linking so many things," he says. "I thought, 'Why just make a concept that's going to change every single time?'"
IAN hasn't shied away from vulnerability. But he recognizes the responsibility that comes with being open.
Showing the highs means you also have show the lows and IAN is cautious of this. "If you've been vulnerable, you can't always share the goods," he says, adding he remains careful of what he speaks about.
With his work, IAN believes he provides something to relate to. "I don't think what I do solves problems. I think what I do gives people relatability," he said. "It's just that comfort in knowing, 'Oh my artist also feels exactly what I'm feeling.'"
"With my understanding and knowledge of learning as I go, I can also just give my two cents of what I'm discovering," he says.
Grab your American flags because Veterans Day is almost here!
Similar to the Fourth of July in that it's a celebration of patriotism, Veterans Day is a day to honor American history and spend time with loved ones. Whether it's a BBQ outside or hanging out indoors with family, hopefully you get to enjoy this federal holiday off with people you love.
Whether you regularly celebrate the holiday or not, you might be wondering when is Veterans Day 2023, and what is the history behind the celebration? Learn more about the national holiday and its importance to the country.
Veteran’s Day 2023 is on Saturday, November 11. 
Yes, Veteran’s Day is a federal holiday. 
On May 13, 1938, an Act made the 11th of November a legal holiday each year, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA). This holiday was known as “Armistice Day,” a day set aside to honor the veterans of World War I. 
Over 15 years later in 1954, World War II deployed the largest number of soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen in the Nation’s history. The 83rd Congress strongly urged the Veterans service organizations to amend the holiday name by switching “Armistice” with “Veterans,” according to the DVA. On June 1, 1954, November 11 became the national holiday dedicated to honoring American Veterans of all wars. 
On October 8, 1954, the first Veterans Day Proclamation was issued by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, according to the DVA. 
World War I ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919, according to the DVA. Seven months earlier the fighting ceased when a truce between the Allied nations and Germany went into effect causing a ceasefire on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.
November 11, 1918, is regarded as the end of “the war to end all wars,” according to the DVA. The observance of Veterans Day on Nov. 11th honors the historical importance of the date but also celebrates and honors American veterans for “their patriotism, love of country, and willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good.”

Favorite foods are often the centerpiece of holiday gatherings. Pumpkin bread and caramel apples at Halloween, turkey and stuffing on Thanksgiving, and honey-glazed ham and gingerbread cookies at Christmastime. No holiday dishes would be complete, however, without a host of herbs and spices flavoring them. These often include herbs like rosemary, sage and thyme; and spices like peppermint, nutmeg and pumpkin. 
Another favorite holiday (and year-round) spice is cinnamon − a spice that's often purported to be as good for one's health as it is tasty in dishes like cinnamon rolls, snickerdoodles and apple pie. 
A versatile and popular spice used for thousands of years, cinnamon comes from various species of cinnamon trees scientifically known as Cinnamomum, per The National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). Such trees are native to Sri Lanka and India, but they are also found in Indonesia, China, Vietnam, and South America. Each locale harvests and processes various types of the spice, but the two most popular kinds are cassia cinnamon and ceylon cinnamon.
Cinnamon is unique because, unlike the many spices that come from the root, stem, or leaves of a plant, cinnamon comes from the inner bark of a tree. After being cut from young cinnamon trees and peeled, the bark curls into the familiar rolls people associated with cinnamon. These rolls are called quills or sticks. Cinnamon is often sold as these bundles, but it's also commonly ground into powder or processed into pill or oil form. 
Depending on its form, cinnamon can be used as a spice in cooking, for aromatherapy, or as a health supplement.
Though cinnamon has been studied extensively for many purported health benefits including ones involving diabetes, insulin resistance, and irritable bowel syndrome, collectively the studies don't show that cinnamon clearly supports any health condition. Some such studies are certainly promising, but results have been mixed and inconclusive overall. One reason why is because "some of these studies used different types and amounts of cinnamon, and some studies were of poor quality," explains Jill Weisenberger, MS, RDN, a Virginia-based registered dietician and author of "Prediabetes: A Complete Guide."
Still, cinnamon has been associated with some general health benefits. As aromatherapy, for instance, cinnamon can be relaxing and stress reducing. Cinnamon is also known to have anti-inflammatory properties, which could matter because inflammation is linked to a host of medical conditions including heart disease.
Also promising are studies that show that cinnamon may lower LDL cholesterol, known as "bad" cholesterol, though such research is ongoing. "Cinnamon also contains antioxidants that can help protect the body from oxidative stress and free radicals which can play a role in reducing the risk of chronic diseases," adds Jen Messer, a nutrition consultant and registered dietitian at Jen Messer Nutrition.
What's more, "some studies have also found a positive effect of cinnamon on metabolism," she says. But she cautions to be wary of anyone who over exaggerates such effects, "especially any claims that push cinnamon's ability to reduce belly fat or promote significant weight loss." She also warns anyone taking cinnamon for the purpose of improving insulin resistance to remember that, "its effects on blood sugar can vary, so cinnamon should never replace medical treatment for these conditions."
Even though cinnamon may not have all the health benefits it's purported to, it's also not likely to do harm in modest amounts. 
As a health supplement, the NCCIH notes that cinnamon appears to be safe when taken as directed. But in large amounts - not typically cooking amounts - or when taken over long periods of time, "cinnamon may become harmful to the liver," cautions Weisenberger. In high quantities, cinnamon is also associated with side effects like gastrointestinal issues, mouth sores, or allergic reactions. 
When used in cooking or added to tea or milk, however, Weisenberger says "you should be comfortable using cinnamon regularly."

It’s hard to wrap your mind around: The social justice warriors on college campuses around America have come out in support of terrorists who last weekend raped and murdered and beheaded innocent people (including children, women and the elderly) in Israel. 
These are the same students who need safe spaces from those who may talk about race or gender in a way they find offensive, or who will shout down and demand the cancellation of speakers with whom they disagree.
Yet, some of them seem perfectly OK with defending the atrocities committed when Hamas invaded Israel in a surprise attack in which the terrorists murdered at least 1,200 Israelis; 27 Americans also died and more than a dozen are missing. 
It seems the higher ed bubble has decided it’s “woke” to support Hamas and to shun Israel, regardless of how horrific the situation. 
And even though many of these students believe “words are violence,” they defend real violence. 
Supporting Israel:Biden's response to Hamas terror attack was weak. US needs strong leadership to support allies.
Student organizations at more than a dozen prominent U.S. universities have issued statements pointing the full blame of the Hamas attack on the back of Israel. Those include Columbia University, the University of Michigan Law School and Northwestern University. 
And on Thursday, local university chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine are planning a “day of resistance” and “protest for Palestine.” In other words, they are standing in solidarity with Hamas terrorists who just slaughtered innocents in the name of “resistance.”
Sickeningly, posters advertising the events highlight a paraglider. Hamas terrorists used paragliders to descend into Israel and proceeded to murder hundreds of young people at a music festival. 
Perhaps the worst offenders – or at least the ones who have received the most attention – are the more than 30 student groups at Harvard University who signed on to a letter stating they “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.”
“Today’s events did not occur in a vacuum,” the students state. “For the last two decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison. Israeli officials promise to ‘open the gates of hell,’ and the massacres in Gaza have already commenced.
“In the coming days, Palestinians will be forced to bear the full brunt of Israel’s violence. The apartheid regime is the only one to blame.”
The statement has unsurprisingly attracted backlash, and the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee has since hidden the names of the other groups that signed on to the misguided missive. 
You can't say that:Oberlin coach stood up for women in sports. Then faced public shaming from her college.
The students haven’t apologized per se, however. They simply seem taken aback that their outrageous views aren’t being welcomed with open arms.
For instance, some major CEOs and investors are calling on Harvard to release the names of the students who signed the statement – so that they can make sure they never employ these people.
Harsh? Maybe. Deserved? Yes. 
As Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz (and Harvard Law grad) posited on X, formerly Twitter: “What the hell is wrong with Harvard?”
Former Harvard President Lawrence Summers has also publicly called out the student statement: “Harvard is being defined by the morally unconscionable statement apparently coming from two dozen student groups blaming all the violence on Israel. I am sickened. I cannot fathom the Administration’s failure to disassociate the University and condemn this statement.”
As of this writing, the Harvard administration has refrained from directly condemning the student statement. 
I’m a firm supporter of free speech, and I think the lack of open debate on college campuses is a huge problem. While one can argue that these student groups have the right to say whatever they want, it’s certainly worth questioning why so many "top" institutions are defending such awful acts.
Canceling comedy:Hope for free speech? Kat Timpf riffs on the power of comedy and dangers of cancel culture.
It’s not just students who are to blame here. They are learning this behavior from somewhere.
Yale associate professor Zareena Grewal, for example, has come out openly in support of Hamas terrorism, stating that “settlers are not civilians" after Saturday's attacks. And college administrations that like to issue statements on pretty much everything else have been noticeably silent now. 
Greg Lukianoff, CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, recently put it this way: “If you find yourself, you know, cheering the people who are raping, murdering, kidnapping … shouldn’t that be a point for reflection?”
It should.
For students and administrators who remain puzzled about how to respond to the attack on Israel, Ben Sasse, the president of the University of Florida (and former GOP U.S. senator), offered an excellent example:
“Our educational mission here begins with the recognition and explicit acknowledgment of human dignity – the same human dignity that Hamas’ terrorists openly scorn. Every single human life matters. We are committed to that truth. We will tell that truth.”

Over the past 20 years, according to authors Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner, the number of federal white-collar prosecutions fell by half. Think of the limited prosecutions following the 2008 financial crisis as proof. The question now is whether the high-profile trial of cryptocurrency magnate Sam Bankman-Fried is about to change that.
First, some history. In the 1980s after the savings and loan crisis, the Department of Justice convicted more than 1,000 bankers. This aggressive approach reached its apex with 2006’s Enron trial.
Since then, though, the number of white-collar prosecutions has dwindled. One reason may be that the financial machinations at the center of white-collar schemes became so complex that prosecutors hesitated to try to explain them to juries.
Whatever the reason, frustration is mounting. Populist movements have blossomed on the right and left, sharing a distrust of the rich. Faith in institutions has plummeted. For my generation (I’m a millennial who graduated college in 2008), we have never known a world where these sorts of cases were the top priority for authorities.
But now Sam Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, and his cryptocurrency exchange (FTX) have entered the chat. If SBF is convicted, it will be Enron for millennials − a generational case that could resuscitate the practice of white-collar convictions. Here’s why.
Set aside the complexity of margin loans, digital currency and cross-border regulations. The question facing SBF’s jury is simple: Did he lie to − did he intend to trick − his customers and use their money as his own?
Proving intent is hard. We cannot crawl inside the mind of a defendant.
Prosecutors instead use circumstantial evidence, such as altered financial statements, to connect the dots.
Crypto's former golden boy is tarnished.What investors can learn from FTX's failure.
I’ve seen plenty of white-collar investigative files, and proving intent will be particularly challenging here. SBF’s defense is that he was an absent-minded professor who lost track of how much money was going in and out of a booming crypto exchange.
Showing intent is even harder when words such as “blockchain” also have to be explained to the jury.
And the stakes for winning are high. Forbes once called SBF the “richest self-made newcomer in Forbes 400 history.” For my parents, I’ve explained it as the equivalent of indicting Warren Buffett.
Will Trump go to prison?Why jail time is unlikely for the former president.
For those of us who work in white-collar law enforcement, we’re watching closely. Prosecutors make decisions about what they think a jury will believe based on what they think society will accept. Will a jury of 12 folks − a teacher, a physician assistant, a train conductor − be able to wade through abstruse finance terms and find SBF guilty?
If so, it may imbue other prosecutors with confidence to take on similar cases.
Or have prosecutors emerged from their post-2006 hidy-hole only to get kicked in the teeth? Was this the wrong case for such a gamble?
If so, law enforcement will have another piece of evidence that financial fraud trials in the age of crypto (and collateralized debt obligations and every other complex instrument) may not be worth trying.

This week, the movie version of Taylor Swift’s record-obliterating Eras Tour opens in theaters around the world. It will be easier than ever to watch Taylor Swift perform. Really, watching Taylor Swift do anything seems to be our national pastime. When she was photographed eating a chicken strip with ketchup and “seemingly ranch,” it made so many headlines that Heinz and the official Empire State Building entered the conversation.
Swift has reached an unfathomable level of fame. One reason we can’t stop looking at her, perhaps, is that her career has always been built around relatability and identification. When we look at her, we see ourselves.
The concept of Taylor Swift’s Eras makes this even easier. As each of her albums has become associated with a distinct personality − a hairstyle, color and vibe − people can look to Swift to express who they are and who they are not, as well as how those categories shift over time.
Taylor Swift first introduced us to the imagery of her eras and the idea of using different versions of herself to represent different albums, moments and personalities back in 2017, in the music video for the "Reputation" track “Look What You Made Me Do.” In it, the different Taylors fight each other, wrestle, cry and hurl insults, seemingly at war with each other. It’s a message about killing the old self and reinventing your identity to survive.
The Eras Tour performance of “Look What You Made Me Do” says something new. Stomping around in a one-legged, snake-bedazzled jumpsuit, Swift slings lines like “The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now … 'cause she’s dead.” Surrounding Swift on the massive stage, the show’s dancers stand locked away in glass boxes, each dressed like a different Taylor era.
Instagram post registers record voters:Taylor Swift has power to swing the presidential election. What if nothing else matters?
Through visual performance cues, Swift speaks to the experience of being misunderstood and misrepresented by others and the disorienting experience of letting yourself become defined by those outside assertions. Even as we accept those identities in an attempt to appease others, all too often we’re left only with self-loathing. Ultimately, her performance speaks to the things we do to ourselves when we let our identities become defined by the judgments of people around us.
It is much easier said than done to refute or even ignore the identities the dominant culture expects us to perform. To use the parlance of “Look What You Made Me Do,” we are all made to play a role, like it or not.
The glass boxes the Taylors are trapped in call to mind glass ceilings yet to be shattered. They also put us on display, easy to see, as tokens of freedom and progress, while still being stuck. Women today have more options about who we can be and where we can go than generations before us, yes. But we are not yet fully free.
We are given options of predetermined identities – ones that make sense to patriarchy – and asked to choose. Who do you want to be? Madonna or whore? Career woman or wife and mother? Pretty or smart? Sporty or flirty? Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte or Miranda?
In some ways, the zeitgeist has attempted to turn Swift’s eras into another one of these metrics. Are you the romantic "Fearless," the upbeat "1989" or melancholic "Evermore"? We accept these categories, use them to sort ourselves and let those categories set the expectations of how we should behave. In some ways, this itself is somewhat liberating.
Taylor’s eras offer women other markers of growth and identity beyond getting married and/or having children. As a single woman in her 30s with no children, my life is sometimes seen by others as stagnant or empty. It’s an untrue assessment, but one that’s pervasive still.
Patriarchy looks first at how a woman is related to others, typically men, to determine who she is. I appreciate that Taylor Swift’s eras offer new ways of presenting aspects of my identity. Swift is also an unmarried, childless woman in her 30s, and her eras take seriously life changes, interests, milestones and identifications that are often dismissed or overlooked. Who do you want to be? Miss, Mrs. or Ms.?
As women learn to navigate gender roles and try to remain intact while navigating unfriendly systems, we are not only expected to choose a box, to select a label, but also to eschew any other version ourselves that falls outside that box. Working mothers still face the "motherhood penalty" at the office. Full-time working moms make 74 cents to every working father’s dollar. Working mothers of color make even less. Attempts to exist in two boxes at once – even if both boxes are “approved options” by the dominant culture – are still punished.
Taylor Swift has punk ethics:Rerecording albums to own her masters is infinitely more punk rock than I am
Taylor Swift hasn’t just rejected the dominant culture’s mandate to choose one identity, she isn’t just the sum of her eras: She is herself − something we, as entities existing outside of her – can never fully know, much less dictate.
This sort of celebration of nuance – an acceptance of and rejoicing in the fullness of female identity – is healing. As our lives become more and more restricted, as the government rolls back women’s rights and our ability to choose what roles we will and will not play, the Eras Tour rolls forward with a glimmer of hope.
We can, at least, be nice to ourselves. And we can only ever dismantle oppressive ideologies if we cease trying to make ourselves acceptable to those ideologies. Together, but rooted in our own self-actualized identities, we can stop playing along with what patriarchy makes women do.

As an Iranian American political scientist and author of books on Iran, Islam and the Middle East, I am horrified by the cold-blooded slaughter and kidnapping of hundreds of Israeli citizens by the Iran-backed Palestinian groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. 
No enlightened Muslim should conflate the legitimate grievance of Palestinians vis-a-vis the state of Israel with the utterly abhorrent and, fully unlawful from the prism of international humanitarian laws, massacre of Israeli civilians, deserving the strongest unequivocal condemnation. What Hamas did with its massacre of innocent civilians was to rob the Palestinian movement of its moral rightness. Those who praise these acts of terror have no conscience. Iran must use its influence to gain the freedom of Israeli hostages. I also fully support the United Nations secretary-general’s call for an immediate end of Gaza’s siege.
Contrary to the misguided celebration of some people in Iran and elsewhere in the Muslim world, the moral standard of any decent Muslim can only guide us to nothing but strong denunciation of the abominable atrocities visited on innocent Israelis in the hands of Palestinian militants openly supported by Iran's hard-liners. The latter have now exposed Iran to potential retaliatory strike by Israel, which has done absolutely nothing to Iran, except helping Iran fight its Iraqi invaders during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, without which Saddam Hussein might have prevailed and wrested away a large chunk of Iranian territory.
Indeed, the last time I looked at the Middle East map, Iran and Israel are distant from each other and there is no direct Iranian national security interest at stake in the long-standing Israel-Palestinian conflict, except the zealous religious ideology, resulting in Iran's hard-liners' overcommitment to an issue not germane to Iran's national interests at all. 
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who nowadays boasts about Iran's full support for Hamas, needs to explain to the Iranian nation what is the connection between the Palestinian issue and Iran's national interests? And has he a short memory and forgotten that when the Iran-Iraq war ended, there were upwards of 15,000 Palestinian prisoners of war in Iran's camps, as many Palestinians volunteered in Hussein's army invading Iran.
To open a caveat, this author once taught at Tufts University and had a conversation with a great Palestinian writer, the late Edward Said, who never criticized Hussein and even questioned, in his piece in Sunday London Times, the accuracy of reports that Hussein had killed hundred of Kurds by using chemical weapons, asking him why he never condemned Hussein's invasion of Iran, since the UN had found him guilty of starting the war in 1980? Said's answer shocked me. "I am an Arab nationalist, what do you think?" Until that moment I had thought that Said was beyond such petty nationalisms and was a cosmopolitan intellectual, apparently not.
So, the question remains: Why should Iran overcommit itself to a cause directly unrelated to Iran's national interests, to the point of Tehran's leaders jeopardizing the nation's peace and security by providing full support for a brutal terroristic assault on Israeli civilians, irrespective of how badly the current Israeli government has been mistreating the Palestinians? 
The Iranian government has not been installed in power to represent the Palestinians or any other nation, only the Iranian nation, which has a proud historical legacy related to Cyrus the Great's liberation of Jews and allowing them to return to their homeland and rebuild their temple.
That enduring legacy of Iran's proud history ought to militate, theoretically speaking, against any religious-inspired tendency to succumb to the logic of exterminism vis-a-vis Israel put on full display by the Hamas militants terrorizing the civilians in southern Israel. So, should in the next days or weeks, Israeli bombs begin to fall on Iran's nuclear facilities in retaliation, Iran's ruling clergy have only themselves to blame.

If you've kept up with celebrity media tours over the last few years, you've likely come across interview shows like "Hot Ones," hosted by Sean Evans; "The Really Good Podcast" by Bobbi Althoff (next interviewing Scarlett Johansson); or Amelia Dimoldenberg's "Chicken Shop Date." Though these shows' setups vary, their strategy seems the same: Place a celebrity in an extremely awkward situation and capture as many candid moments as possible.
Cringeworthy clips from these shows regularly go viral on TikTok and Instagram, begging the question: What is it about celebrities and excruciating awkwardness that makes us feel like we can't look away?
"There's a reason we are obsessed with this, and much of it has to do with the fact that, whether we mean to or not, we put celebrities on a pedestal," says Henna Pryor, a workplace performance expert and author of "Good Awkward: How to Embrace the Embarrassing and Celebrate the Cringe to Become The Bravest You." "From where we sit, they tend to be extremely good looking, extremely successful. They've got talent that drips from the sky … There's something very relatable and real about seeing them in their element and remembering they're human."
Pryor defines awkwardness as the emotion experienced when the person we believe we are isn't the person who is being perceived.
This gap between the idea of the self versus the true self is especially compelling when observed in celebrities, she says, because we feel we're getting a glimpse into who a star really is behind their carefully crafted persona.
"For a moment in time, that external reality doesn't match the identity we painted for them, and we find that fascinating," she says.
Ty Tashiro, a psychologist and author of "Awkward: The Science of Why We’re Socially Awkward and Why That’s Awesome," says awkwardness can also be instructional and therefore captivating. By watching other people's social blunders, he says, we learn what not to do.
"It's a great opportunity for us to learn about social life and social expectations and social behavior without having to risk any of our social capital," he says. "It's a real advantage to be able to learn vicariously from watching other people's awkward moments."
People love seeing celebrities in uncomfortable situations in particular, he says, because of a phenomenon called downward social comparison. Tashiro describes this as feeling better about oneself from seeing another person feel worse.
"Hot Ones," which shows celebrities struggling to eat chicken wings dipped in extraordinarily spicy hot sauce, capitalizes on this to great effect, he says.
"At that moment, we're actually doing better than the celebrity is," he says. "Something feels a little bit extra sweet about that."

Though intentionally awkward interviews may appear to put celebrities in an unflattering light, they actually do just the opposite, says Ellen Hendriksen, a clinical psychologist and author of "How to Be Yourself: Quiet Your Inner Critic and Rise Above Social Anxiety." By showing their awkward side, celebrities give the impression of vulnerability, which endears them to fans even more.
As a result, a sweaty interview over hot wings may do more to bolster a celebrity's public profile than a traditional news interview.
"When the guests put themselves in these situations and are either sweating profusely or trying to get through this super awkward interview, it's vulnerable," Hendriksen says. "What they're doing is signaling we are the same, the celebrity and the viewers, because who among us hasn't tried to play it cool or act casual when we're suffering a little? Who hasn't been stuck in an awkward conversation that has no graceful way out?"
Awkward interviews are also more prone to go viral, because they fit into the unfiltered aesthetic that's currently popular on social media.
"We went through a very perfectionistic, self-presentational phase," Hendriksen says. "The Gen-Z aesthetic is deliberately weird and ugly and cringe-y as the pendulum just swings the other way. I think we're all sick of perfection and want to see some authenticity."
Whether cringe interviews are a passing fad or here to say remains to be seen; regardless, Tashiro hopes that, in the meantime, they can empower all of us to abandon perfection and embrace our true selves − even if doing so feels a little awkward.
"There's so much pressure in celebrity culture or even influencer culture these days to present this perfect self to the rest of the world. As we know, a lot of people really suffer under that kind of pressure," he says. "I think it's great, whether it's in these shows or podcasts, to create these more genuine and real moments."
Favorite foods are often the centerpiece of holiday gatherings. Pumpkin bread and caramel apples at Halloween, turkey and stuffing on Thanksgiving, and honey-glazed ham and gingerbread cookies at Christmastime. No holiday dishes would be complete, however, without a host of herbs and spices flavoring them. These often include herbs like rosemary, sage and thyme; and spices like peppermint, nutmeg and pumpkin. 
Another favorite holiday (and year-round) spice is cinnamon − a spice that's often purported to be as good for one's health as it is tasty in dishes like cinnamon rolls, snickerdoodles and apple pie. 
A versatile and popular spice used for thousands of years, cinnamon comes from various species of cinnamon trees scientifically known as Cinnamomum, per The National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). Such trees are native to Sri Lanka and India, but they are also found in Indonesia, China, Vietnam, and South America. Each locale harvests and processes various types of the spice, but the two most popular kinds are cassia cinnamon and ceylon cinnamon.
Cinnamon is unique because, unlike the many spices that come from the root, stem, or leaves of a plant, cinnamon comes from the inner bark of a tree. After being cut from young cinnamon trees and peeled, the bark curls into the familiar rolls people associated with cinnamon. These rolls are called quills or sticks. Cinnamon is often sold as these bundles, but it's also commonly ground into powder or processed into pill or oil form. 
Depending on its form, cinnamon can be used as a spice in cooking, for aromatherapy, or as a health supplement.
Though cinnamon has been studied extensively for many purported health benefits including ones involving diabetes, insulin resistance, and irritable bowel syndrome, collectively the studies don't show that cinnamon clearly supports any health condition.

When most people quip that they're "a bit OCD," they probably just mean they're a neat freak.
For Howie Mandel, it means much more than that.
Though the "America's Got Talent" judge didn't receive his diagnosis for obsessive-compulsive disorder until his 40s, the 67-year-old says OCD has had a profound impact on most of his life. This OCD Awareness Week, which falls the second week of October, the comedian is partnering with NOCD, a company that provides video-based OCD therapy.
"The word 'suffer' is not even strong enough," he says of his experience with the condition, while speaking over a Zoom call from Las Vegas. "If I think I got a germ on my hand, I can't think or hear anything else. I just have to get that germ off my hand. Then I'll wash my hand ... stay in the bathroom, keep wiping, miss a birthday party, miss an important event, miss work, and I just can't move past this brick wall of horror."
That wall has gotten easier to deal with, he says, thanks to a combination of medication and therapy, but it's still something that's always there − which is why it's frustrating when well-meaning fans claim they experience the same thing, when it's clear they don't.
"A day doesn't go by (without someone saying,) 'I know you're a germaphobe. I got a bit of OCD too.' Well, I don't know that you do," he says. "There's a big difference between being a little bit neurotic and having OCD."
OCD is not that uncommon:Understand the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder.
According to Mayo Clinic, OCD involves persistent patterns of unwanted thoughts and fears, known as obsessions, that lead to repetitive behaviors, known as compulsions.
Ignoring or trying to stop these obsessions can worsen anxiety, so people with OCD are often driven to perform compulsive acts in an attempt to relieve stress. These patterns can be time-consuming, interfere with day-to-day life and cause significant impairment.
Examples of obsessions include fear of contamination and intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way. Compulsions can take the form of hand-washing to the point of damaging the skin, repeatedly checking the stove to make sure it's off or counting in certain patterns.
Mandel recalls how his OCD once drove him to check if a door was locked so many times it occupied him for hours.
"It's just this vicious, dark circle, and it makes you... unproductive, unhappy, depressed," he says. "Sometimes there are people that have this that even end in suicide. It's not a good thing, but the deal is that there is an answer, and there is help out there."

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic proved especially difficult for Mandel, who has an OCD-driven fear of germs and famously avoids shaking hands.
The comedian says he coped with the added stress the way he has with many hardships: with humor. Still, he says, laughter can only do so much.
"For somebody who was triggered by germs, COVID was not helpful," he says. "I made a lot of jokes, and people do make jokes, like, 'You were right, Howie. Now everybody needs to wear gloves and wash their hands.' But it was hell and really affected me, and I'm traumatized by it."
There has been at least one upside to the pandemic for Mandel: his podcast "Howie Mandel Does Stuff," which he co-hosts with his daughter Jackelyn Shultz, who's also diagnosed with OCD. He says the two got the idea for the project while finding ways to cope with the stress of early COVID life.

On the "AGT" set, Mandel says his fellow judges are understanding and considerate of his condition and everyone he works with is "so open about mental health." He also praised his co-judge Simon Cowell, 64, for recently revealing he went to therapy to help treat his depression.
Mandel says it can be especially intimidating for people of his and Cowell's generation to share their mental health struggles.
He hopes that by speaking out he can help change that stigma.
"I think the younger you are, the easier it is to be open about mental health," he says. "The reason I have that strength is because not only me, not only my daughter, but a lot of people are expanding the ability to share."
Plus, he says, the more people acknowledge their imperfections, the more they acknowledge their humanity.
"I feel broken ... but I don't know what perfection is," he says. "I don't know what fixed is. I think that everybody's got a little break in them. I think some people aren't aware of it. ... I don't know that there is perfection with anybody."

LOS ANGELES – Call it a Tay-quake. A seismic ground shift that will overtake movie theaters on Thursday, but first trembled Wednesday night, when Taylor Swift's "The Eras Tour" concert film made its world premiere.
The movie, which the savvy Swift innovated primarily as a way for fans who couldn’t experience her colossal – and equally impressive – Eras Tour, received a debut befitting the comely superstar, whose every footstep seems to require breathless attention.
At the AMC Grove 14 in LA, about 2,200 people – a mix of fans, celebrities including Adam Sandler and Maren Morris, and entertainment industry insiders – filled every theater inside the complex. The surrounding ritzy outdoor shopping mall was closed for the day to allow for the setup and to better patrol ticketless Swifties yearning for a glimpse of their (decidedly not anti) hero.
More:Watching the world premiere of 'Eras Tour' movie with Taylor Swift felt like a dance party
After popping in to visit invited moviegoers in 13 of the theaters, Swift arrived at the one offering Dolby sound – the most effective presentation of this faithful-to-the-live-show movie – with a casual, "Hi, guys."
Swift stood at the front of the theater for a few minutes to express how much fun she's had performing during her Eras Tour and praised her backup singers and dancers, several of whom sat alongside her, pumping fists and singing along as the film unfolded.
"We pranced on that stage grinning because of what met us on the other side," Swift said. "You are main characters in this film. You cared so much about these shows."
Fans enthralled by the Eras concert will undoubtedly thrill at the opportunity to relive the magic and enjoy "The Eras Tour" as a communal concert experience more than a staid movie.

At just under three hours, the celluloid version of Swift's live spectacle is about 30 minutes shorter than her in-person performances throughout her six-month U.S. tour (her overseas dates kick off in November).
Her live shows offered an incredibly fulfilling set list of 45 songs – once she added "Long Live" to the rundown in July – and the film, directed by Sam Wrench, shaves off only a handful of tunes for a more efficient run time.
The songs that didn’t make the cut: "The Archer," "No Body, No Crime," "Long Live," "Illicit Affairs," "Cardigan" and "Wildest Dreams."
The concert footage comes from Swift's final U.S. shows of 2023 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California – she played an astounding six nights at the 70,000-capacity venue – and the film pulls from her Aug. 4 and Aug. 5 dates for her customary "surprise" songs.
Swift opted for "Our Song" to "thank the people who liked me when I was a little teenager writing songs for my ninth-grade talent show," she says on stage in the film.
After leading a crowd singalong of the sweet acoustic strummer, Swift takes her place behind the piano for "You're On Your Own, Kid," from her "Midnights" album.
The entire film offers a front-row seat to the grandeur. The staging is so massive that even the best seats in a stadium – and the King Kong-sized video screens – could provide only so much detail.
But on the big screen, the close-ups are glorious, whether zooming in on Swift's cat-eye makeup outlining her crystal blue eyes, the moss covering her piano and the sweat sticking to her bangs during "Champagne Problems" and her meticulous table setting at the start of "Tolerate It."
Among the performances, "Look What You Made Me Do" sizzles. The detailed shots of the various Swift incarnations in glass cases spotlight the intricacy of the number, while Swift is in her snarling, sexy glory as the camera whirls around her.
"Blank Space" – already one of the meatiest songs in her extensive catalog – also receives a boost from Swift's uncanny ability to find the camera for a coy wink and to unleash her long-legged strut.
Theaters will set their own rules, but the general consensus is that fans are encouraged to have fun, just not at the expense of fellow moviegoers.
At the premiere, it was difficult to tell the screams from the crowd on film from the cheers in the audience, and throughout, several fans stood to sing and dance along. By the time the show-closing "Karma" rolled out, the atmosphere felt like the encore at a concert, a joyful encounter full of love that indicated Swift isn't the only one having a blast at her shows.

The fifth season of "Love is Blind," and the romantic journeys of the members of the cast, are coming to an end.
The singles who entered the pods at the beginning of the season have seen many twists and turns in their journey to find love.
The show centers around singles who "want to be loved for who they are," as Netflix says. They contestants signed up for a "less conventional approach to modern dating," as they choose someone to marry without ever meeting them.
The group of singles that participated in Season 5 includes a stylist, firefighter, petroleum engineer and a minister.
Here's everything you need to know about the "Love is Blind" Season 5 finale and how to watch it.

The hour-long finale is set to hit Netflix on Friday, Oct. 13. The previous nine episodes are also available to stream on the platform.
The show is hosted by Vanessa and Nick Lachey.
Season 5 of the show returns to Texas, with the season being filmed in Houston.
Season 3 was filmed in Dallas and Season 4 took place in Seattle.
First it was "Barbenheimer" season. Now, it's officially the "Renaissance Era."
In a show of legendary pop stars supporting one another, Beyoncé appeared as a guest at the world premiere of Taylor Swift's concert film "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour" in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
Swift, 33, wore that red lip, classic thing her fans like (IYKYK!) and a blue, quilted Oscar de la Renta ballgown fit for the star of the night. Beyoncé, 42, posed alongside the "Lavender Haze" singer, wearing a chrome breastplate over a black bodysuit, in true Renaissance fashion.
The "Karma" singer shared a Boomerang video with the "Virgo's Groove" singer on Instagram as they enjoyed each other's company over a tub of popcorn.
"I'm so glad I’ll never know what my life would’ve been like without @beyonce‘s influence," Swift captioned the post. "The way she's taught me and every artist out here to break rules and defy industry norms."
The 33-year-old pop star continued to praise her peer for "her generosity of spirit" and "her resilience and versatility."
"She's been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale," Swift concluded.
The multi-Grammy award winners each headlined two of the biggest tours of the year, both of which are getting the concert movie treatment.
Both Swifties and the Beyhive have been in a race to score tickets for "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour" and "Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé," the former of which premiered today and latter hitting theaters on Dec. 1.
It's unclear when Beyoncé plans to have her concert film premiere, but we can only guess Swift will be a guest.
Fans enthralled by the Eras concert will undoubtedly thrill at the opportunity to relive the magic and enjoy "The Eras Tour" as a communal concert experience more than a staid movie, USA TODAY's music critic Melissa Ruggieri says.

The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee has begun a process to send financial assistance to Mary Lou Retton, the 1984 Olympic gymnastics gold medalist whose daughter says she is “fighting for her life,” USOPC spokeswoman Kate Hartman told USA TODAY Sports Thursday morning. 
“The USOPC supports the United States Olympians & Paralympians Relief Fund to offer aid to U.S. Olympians and Paralympians facing significant hardships due to illness, death or extenuating circumstances,” Hartman said. 
“Upon learning of Mary Lou's condition, we immediately took action to expedite the application process for her family to receive assistance. We are currently working through the necessary details in real-time and have reached out to Mary Lou’s family to offer our assistance.”
Retton, 55, one of the greatest names in U.S. Olympic history, “has a very rare form of pneumonia and is fighting for her life,” her daughter McKenna Kelley, a former gymnast at LSU, said in a spotfund.com post that she shared on her Instagram story Tuesday.
“She is not able to breathe on her own,” Kelley continued. “She’s been in the ICU for over a week now. Out of respect for her and her privacy, I will not disclose all details. However, I will disclose that she (is) not insured.”
In an Instagram post Wednesday, Kelley said Retton remains in the ICU and “continues to fight. She is getting incredible medical care! Thank you to all the doctors and nurses!” 
OPINION:Nearly 40 years since she barreled into history, America still loves Mary Lou Retton
Kelley has not replied to repeated messages from USA TODAY Sports seeking comment. She is the second oldest of Retton’s four daughters, all of whom have been involved in gymnastics. Retton married former University of Texas quarterback Shannon Kelley in 1990. They divorced in 2018. 
The spotfund.com donation page for Retton is showing more than $360,000 in contributions as of Thursday morning.
In what is believed to be Retton’s most recent public appearance, she gave a moderated keynote address at the USOPC’s General Assembly in Los Angeles Sept. 14. She spoke for 20 minutes to an audience of about 500, Hartman said. Most of her speech centered on her experiences at the 1984 Olympics, which were held in Los Angeles.
Hartman said that the USOPC has no further information about Retton’s health or her condition. She said the amount of money that will come from the relief fund will be kept confidential. 
“Mary Lou Retton has been an incredible icon and a source of inspiration in the U.S. Olympic movement,” Hartman said. “Her groundbreaking achievements, particularly as the first American woman to win a gold medal in gymnastics, have left an indelible mark on the sports landscape. 
“Retton's relentless spirit, verve and dedication continue to inspire countless athletes across the country, embodying the true spirit of the Olympics. We all hold her in our hearts during this challenging time and are hopeful for her to make a full recovery. Our thoughts and best wishes are with her and her family. We know that if anyone can tackle challenges with strength and grace, it's Mary Lou.”
University of Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders wears a $70,000 stainless steel wristwatch with more than 30 carats of diamonds that were drilled into it by a jeweler in Florida.
The Royal Oak watch itself normally would cost about $30,000 from Swiss manufacturer Audemars Piguet. But this particular watch is different. Jacksonville jeweler Saki Mihalakos customized it by adding the glittering jewels, dramatically boosting its sparkle and value before he hand-delivered it to Sanders last year.
"It's fully iced-out with diamonds," Mihalakos told USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday.
The point was to make it more attractive and turn heads long before it recently became the main accessory in a signature move that has triggered a small cultural wave of sorts in American sports, including imitators in the NBA and NFL.
It's called the watch flex. It's become far more conspicuous than the watch itself. After another brazen display of it last week, it's also creating controversy about whether it's cool, classless or just another genius marketing move by Sanders and his father, Deion, Colorado's coach. Their next performance comes Friday night against Stanford (1-5) on ESPN.
Shedeur Sanders, the nation’s leader in total passing yards, has flashed his watch several times this season during emotionally charged moments, raising his left arm to show it to people, including last week when he flexed it to the Arizona State student section after his team beat the Sun Devils, 27-24.
Is he just having fun and smartly bringing attention to himself to boost his own earning potential?
For example, his online store already sold out of some hooded black sweatshirts that depict the watch flex. They cost $100.
Or is this gesture unsportsmanlike and excessive, as many on social media have said?
The opinions are polarized. In some cases, race might play a role in how this watch move has been perceived negatively, experts told USA TODAY Sports. Yet it’s not much different than what white quarterback Johnny Manziel did 10 years ago when he flashed his "money sign," rubbing his fingers together in celebration as if he was sifting through cash.
"I think part of it is he’s young and he’s Black, and young Black quarterbacks haven’t been able to act like that, just because of the position and how that position is policed," said Louis Moore, a history professor at Grand Valley State in Michigan whose research has examined race and sports.
By flexing his watch, the 21-year-old Shedeur Sanders is effectively showing what time it is after feeling miffed or disrespected, as he did before his team beat Colorado State in double overtime Sept. 16. That’s when Colorado State head coach Jay Norvell criticized Deion Sanders for wearing sunglasses and hats too frequently for his taste.
After the game, Shedeur Sanders even flashed his watch at Norvell. Then he did it again the same night during an interview on ESPN.
"We not going out like that, especially, you know, if somebody disrespect Pops," he said then. "I was just waiting the whole time to put a watch on ‘em."
The week before that, Shedeur Sanders also flexed his watch at the Nebraska Cornhuskers, who had disrespectfully walked on the Buffaloes’ logo in the middle of Folsom Field, according to him.
But it’s not a marketing move for the watch manufacturer, at least not yet.
"We’ve just got to get him a lucrative watch deal," Deion Sanders said Tuesday at his weekly news conference. "He can’t keep doing it for free … We gotta capitalize now. He is my son. Gotta capitalize on the moment, right?"
Certain celebrities have embraced it.
 "That’s the new move," rapper Rick Ross said on social media last month as he flashed his own watch to the camera.
"I call this the Shedeur," famed DJ and record producer DJ Khaled said as he did the same.
NBA and NFL players have copied the move, too, including New York Jets players Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall.
"I love to see it," Deion Sanders said. “It’s hilarious to me, because he and I joke about it on a daily basis.”
But many have the opposite reaction. After the Arizona State game, social media users on X (formerly Twitter,) bashed the Buffaloes quarterback. They might not have known that fans for Arizona State (1-5) had chanted "overrated" at his team before that.
"If there was a Heisman for beating 1-5 teams this guy would win it," former NFL and Florida State quarterback Danny Kanell wrote of Shedeur’s watch display.
"Blatant show of immaturity," another commenter wrote..
"Corny," said another.
"No class, like his dad."
"Deion is so much more likeable than Shedeur."
"Bragging about money is trashy."
"This is why everyone hates Colorado."
Brash, wealthy young athletes have that effect, depending on fan loyalties and standards of sportsmanship. History adds additional context when that brash young athlete is Black.
For example, in the early 1900s, boxer Jack Johnson “sported fashionable fur coats, three-piece suits, and diamonds as a means to counter prevailing images of Black inferiority and savagery," said Theresa Runstedtler, associate professor in the history department at American University and author of a book on Jack Johnson.
Johnson was part of a long line of Black athletes who effectively thumbed their noses at these racist notions by showing off their affluence.
In this case, Shedeur Sanders "seems to be speaking back to the haters (and there has been a lot of racially tinged hate on social media about his father and the Colorado team) by flaunting Black wealth and success in the face of ASU fans," Runstedtler said in an email.
Moore, the history professor, said he doesn’t remember the "money sign” from Manziel being as polarizing, even though it’s similar. "People loved Johnny Manziel and that money sign," he said.
He said Shedeur is taking after his father, who appears on several national commercials and has been in the public eye for decades as a former two-sport star in pro football and baseball. It works for Shedeur now, too, because college athletes are allowed to cash in on their fame by selling names, images and likenesses (NIL).
"I think Deion and Shedeur are playing to the camera very smartly," he said. "They also understand that even negative attention is positive when it comes to their bank accounts. In that sense, he’s very much like a young, brash (boxer) Cassius Clay or Muhammed Ali. He understands that the more people dislike me or the more people get upset, the more attention I get − that’s a good thing for him."
Last week he said it was something that originated spontaneously.
"It just happened," he said at a news conference in Boulder. "I didn’t know it was really gonna blow up or anything like that because it was just, you know, it was just in the moment. Nothing was like premeditated I would say to where I know, 'OK I’m gonna go do this.’ "
He said he "took it and ran with it."
His father said it goes back further and remembers him wearing jewelry and nice watches in high school. But he conceded that "we’re on a bigger stage" now, drawing more attention nationally.
The jeweler who customized the watch for Shedeur has his own opinion of the watch flex. He’s a former defensive back and assistant coach at South Florida.
"It’s about fun and looking good at the same time," Mihalakos said. He declined to say what Shedeur paid for the watch but said it’s worth about $70,000.
For Shedeur, it also means something else besides money, according to posts on his Instagram account
"Perfect timing."

As the news that Mary Lou Retton is “fighting for her life” swept across social media Tuesday, sending tens of thousands to rally virtually to her side, there was an undeniable and uplifting sense that we had all been here before. 
Of course we had. This is Mary Lou Retton, and this is us, and there’s something very reassuring in knowing that this nation loves her just as much today as it did nearly 40 years ago, when an ever-smiling 16-year-old tomboy, a tiny fullback in a gymnast’s leotard, barreled toward the vault at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, flew into the air and landed in every American living room. 
Forty years of adoration is a lot of years and a lot of love. I have been fortunate to witness it all as a journalist, to interview and catch up with Mary Lou on the phone, at social events, at subsequent Olympics. But it all goes back to those early days in 1984, summed up so succinctly and presciently by a copy of Sports Illustrated I pulled out of a cabinet Wednesday morning, one of my many mementos from the L.A. Olympics, which were my first.
On the cover of the August 13, 1984 issue is a photo of a jubilant young athlete in red, white and blue, fists clenched, arms raised in triumph, with the headline: “Only you, Mary Lou!”
She was lovable from the get-go. We actually met before the L.A. Games. I looked it up in my diary: it was June 3, 1984, the morning after she qualified for the U.S. Olympic team at the gymnastics trials in Jacksonville. I was with the Miami Herald then, and photographer Bill Frakes and I drove to the motel where Mary Lou and her family were staying. The press availability that we were expecting ended up being a family affair: just Bill, me and the Rettons, all sitting on chaise lounges by the pool in Florida, far from their Fairmont, West Virginia, home.
Mary Lou told me she wished she was taller. She was 4-9. “I wish I was 5 feet tall,” she said. “That would be perfect.” 
Her parents used to tell her they were going to give her hormone shots to help her grow but never did. So short jokes became a big part of her young life. Her favorite: “Stand up, Mary Lou,” when she already was. 
Her father, Ronnie, a veritable giant at 5-7, was an athlete as well. He was the sixth man, a guard, on the West Virginia men’s basketball team that was led by Hall of Famer Jerry West.
Mary Lou was a natural athlete who was unstoppable inside the house. Her mother, Lois, said she finally put Mary Lou into a gymnastics class when far too many lamps were overturned.
“I was a tomboy,” Mary Lou told me. “I looked like a little boy. I even ran around topless.”
She said all this with a smile. Everything about this teenager, unknown to me until that week, screamed out fun, joy, happiness. Bill had an idea for a photo and asked if anyone had any bubble gum. I actually did, so I handed it to Mary Lou, who started chewing and then blew a massive pink bubble that covered her entire face. This made quite a picture, with her grandmother standing beside her, looking on with a wry smile, both of them in bathing suits. 
That day by the pool, the Rettons had no idea what was waiting for their daughter, but whatever it was, there was some trepidation about it. 
“I worry about her,” Lois Retton said. “I worry when she travels, about the security when she performs. She’s 16. She should be going to proms and ball games. I feel like I’ve lost her to the world. Will she ever come back?”
She did, just much more famous. Mary Lou of course became the darling of those Olympics, a household name, a role model for several generations of young female athletes — and someone I would seek for perspective when writing about little girls in big-time sports.
She has one of my favorite quotes on the subject:
“While other kids were reading about the Great Wall, I was walking on it.”
It’s worth remembering exactly what happened at those 1984 Olympics. With a perfect 10 on the vault at UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion, Retton became the first American to win the women’s individual all-around gold medal, one of the most coveted titles in all of sports. She won five medals altogether in L.A., including silvers in the team competition and on the vault, and bronze medals on the uneven bars and floor exercise. Considering that no American woman had ever won an individual Olympic gymnastics medal of any color, she was a revelation.
She also knew luck was on her side. The strong Soviet gymnasts, including the reigning women’s individual all-around world champion, were not in L.A., having boycotted those Games. But the highly-regarded Romanians did compete in L.A., and, as Retton said, “It was a big battle. I earned my medal.”
What happened next was a dream. She was everywhere, from the front of the Wheaties box to SI’s Sportswoman of the Year. She appeared on gymnastics tours, on TV shows and in the movies. She has been a constant presence at the Olympic Games and is one of the most sought-after speakers and celebrities in the U.S. Olympic movement. 
She also has four daughters, all of whom have been involved in gymnastics. She got a kick out of relating how she tried to remain anonymous when taking one of her daughters to a gymnastics class. That didn’t last long. 
“They knew it was me,” she said with a hearty laugh.
In the same week that the sports world continues to celebrate the greatness of Simone Biles, there’s now an outpouring of concern over the woman who started it all. 
“As the first U.S. all-around Olympic gymnastics champion, Mary Lou Retton became a shining icon of American excellence,” veteran sports agent Sheryl Shade texted Wednesday. “Her legacy is important, as her performance and personality inspired millions of girls (and parents) to swell the ranks of women’s gymnastics in the USA. Many of my gymnast clients had her poster in their rooms and on their vision boards even though she competed years before they were born.”
Who are some of those clients? Laurie Hernandez, Shawn Johnson, Shannon Miller, Amanda Borden, Jaycie Phelps and Gabby Douglas, Olympic stars all.
That Sports Illustrated cover had it right all those years ago. Mary Lou, it has always been only you. 
Spoon Daftary apologized into his headset for a slightly rushed segment, but the clock was already ticking on this commercial break. 
"Just go with the flow," the "Thursday Night Football" senior coordinating producer ordered from the command truck at FedEx Field, not long after the Chicago Bears defeated the Washington Commanders. "Everyone have fun here." 
That’s usually not an issue for the traveling studio crew of Richard Sherman, Andrew Whitworth, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Tony Gonzalez and host Charissa Thompson – the people Daftary is instructing from the truck. They were about to play a game, he said, as celebrity chef David Chang rejoined the set. 
It’s a simple premise. Producers from the truck will put up a name on the screen. The panel must answer whether that person played in the NFL or is a United States Congressperson – "On the Hill" or "On the Field" – all while chowing down on spicy chicken sandwiches from Chang’s restaurant.
"Roll the dice here," Daftary said. "What can go wrong?" 
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
The hijinks may lose a viewer more interested in a traditional NFL post-game show. But for the type of content Daftary’s bosses at Amazon Prime Video desire, this is par for the course. 
Now in the second year of exclusively streaming the games, Daftary wants the postgame show to be memorable enough – through both creative bits and substantive football conversation – sports fans are talking about it Friday morning. 
"My dream is somebody says, ‘Ah, (expletive), I fell asleep. What did I miss?’" Daftary told USA TODAY Sports. "That’s what I want to continue to push to our staff and to our talent. I want our show to be that: ‘I gotta stay up late to watch.’" 
As Daftary and executive producer Mike Muriano started building the “TNF” studio team, they were aware of the natural constraints all pregame, halftime and postgame shows have structurally. But as Amazon became the league's first new media partner in nearly 30 years, the company also saw the opportunity of a blank canvas. 
"We're OK with this feeling a little more raw and authentic, I think, than sort of the polished Sunday morning pregame shows that I've been a part of in the past," said Daftary, who spent nine years at FOX, where he held the same role for "FOX NFL Kickoff." 
Daftary said FOX’s takeover of the NFC package in 1993 ushered in the modern era of studio programming. A streaming giant taking center stage for the NFL one night per week represented a chance to take another step toward the boundaries. 
"Collectively, we're just like, ‘We have to take some swings, we know not everything’s gonna be great," Daftary said. "But like, we want to take the swings and see where we land." 
One place they landed this season was Intercourse, Pennsylvania, for a dispatch by contributor Marshawn Lynch from Amish country. 
That type of segment likely would not have been flown at network television. At Amazon, it’s encouraged. 
"It's refreshing," Muriano told USA TODAY Sports. "Sometimes, senior management is saying ‘No, push a little bit more’ and we're the ones going, ‘Hey, not that far.’" 
Finding talking heads who took the job seriously – but not necessarily themselves – has been essential in delivering a different type of show, Muriano said. Their willingness to pitch ideas makes the show that much better, he added. 
"We've got a group that is invested that way, which again, that's so rewarding to see that you're not the only one trying to come up with everything," said Muriano, who has been involved in producing every "Thursday Night Football" game in NFL history. "The show is better for it." 
Thompson, Fitzpatrick, Sherman, Whitworth, Gonzalez and the producers will have a video call – a 45-minute brain dump, as Daftary put it – every Monday to discuss that week’s upcoming game. From there, the producers begin outlining a show ahead of a Monday afternoon production call in which the sketch becomes more of a rundown. Last week, when Daftary mentioned that Fitzpatrick lost his mind upon hearing that Commanders part-owner Magic Johnson would be joining the pregame show, the producers started coming up with ideas to leverage his fanboying into a made-for-TV moment. 
Reading the letters Fitzpatrick wrote to Johnson as a boy was one idea. The crew brainstormed ways for Johnson to sign items for Fitzpatrick and how to place that into the segment. Of course, it would have to be right before commercial break. And they’d have to make sure Johnson sat next to the former quarterback. 
When it was showtime 72 hours later, Fitzpatrick was all smiles as he unveiled his No. 32 Lakers jersey beneath his signature zany button-down shirt. 
"Spoon allows for that creativity, allows for us to have a little bit of fun on set," Fitzpatrick told USA TODAY Sports. "So the fact we do have that leeway and he’s given us that creative freedom, I think really helps the process. We don’t feel limited or put in boxes."
The postgame show – "TNF Nightcap" – is the aspect of the production the team takes “a ton” of pride in, Daftary said.
"That’s a place we have an open canvas to do a lot of things that other shows don’t – between our guest interviews and our actual football conversations, which, by the way, I would put up against anybody else’s actual football conversations," Daftary said. 
Through four weeks, "TNF Nightcap" is averaging 2.08M viewers, which is an increase of 24% over last year’s full-season average (1.68M), according to Prime Video. (“TNF Tonight,” the pregame show, is averaging 500,000 more viewers per week compared to 2022.)
The morning of the Bears-Commanders matchup, the crew met in a hotel conference room to review the show rundown. On more than one occasion, as Daftary lead the meeting, the talent are told to save it for the show.
"We've been part of shows where almost every word is rehearsed and gone through," Muriano said. "And we've been shown we've been on parts of shows where not enough of that has happened as well."
Finding the sweet spot is the challenge of creating programming in 2023 for a streaming service. Other market forces, like podcasts, have influenced the way they construct the show too. 
"It's so less-produced," Daftary said. "So how do we still produce a show that feels network-level where our halftime is gonna be viewed by (millions of) people? So it's not a podcast, we don't want it to be a podcast. The elements in the show have to reach a bar." 
That type of transition made it easier on the trio of Whitworth, Fitzpatrick and Sherman, all of whom went straight from the playing field to analysts’ chairs (Gonzalez and Thompson both had ample television experience prior to joining “TNF”). Everyone had homework following an offseason of reviewing video, and former players' experience make them more coachable than other people Daftary has worked with in the past. 
Making sure they don’t lose their personality by improving for television is a fine line to walk. 
"If something becomes too rehearsed, it just feels like audiences have just gotten so savvy," said Muriano, who has an instant focus-group with four teenage children watching at home. "That teenage radar really just sniffs out when something's not authentic so quickly in this day and age. And I think it's because there's so much content they're consuming in different ways. As soon as they see someone kind of stiffen up, they’re like, ‘Why isn't he just talking normal? Why isn't she just talking normally?’ So we try to stay as real as we can." 
The "TNF" team met throughout the offseason to preview that year's upcoming games. During one of those sessions, it became clear that a "Quiz Bowl" for the Week 3 game between the San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants in the Bay Area would be the perfect setting. Sherman went to Stanford. Gonzalez is a proud Cal product. Fitzpatrick famously graduated from Harvard.
But that "TNF Tonight" led to the most viral moment of the season, with ex-NFL quarterback Andrew Luck dressing in meme version, "Capt. Andrew Luck," a social media account that likened Luck's football conquests to a Civil War-era Union soldier.
"I want a space where everybody can pitch an idea, and anyone can pitch an idea," said Daftary, who almost talked Luck out of dressing up in costume for his postgame appearance only to realize he was overthinking the bit.
"That would be the perfect amount of craziness," he realized.
To close out the Week 5 broadcast from the nation's capital, Daftary and Co. wanted to capitalize on a "wild" week in D.C. Kevin McCarthy had been ousted as Speaker of the House. Something political – but not polarizing – felt appropriate.
"Is this going to be the greatest thing ever? Probably not," Daftary said. "But it’ll be a fun way to end the show. We got David Chang, we got fried chicken sandwiches."
With the cameras rolling, Thompson – the only one who had prior knowledge of the game – accidentally gave away the answer to the first question.
No memes or viral posts came from the segment. A few laughs for sure. The show ended with Daftary shaking the hands of those around him in the truck. He said the segment featuring Fitzpatrick being honored at his high school the previous weekend was too much. Muriano assured him it was fine.
"I'm not going to lose sleep over it," Daftary said.
He hopes everyone else watching did.
A stabbing attack that left three people hospitalized temporarily shut down the security line at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport’s domestic terminal on Wednesday evening.
Posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, first documented the incident at around 5 p.m. ET. The Atlanta Police Department and Atlanta Airport confirmed the incident on X about a half hour later. 
Sarah Nagem, who was at the scene, tweeted a photo of people sitting on the ground in line at security with the caption, “Female with a knife tried to stab someone.”
In additional tweets, Nagem said it was a “domestic situation” and the security line resumed once deemed safe. 
Three people were injured in the attack, according to a statement by the Atlanta Police Department.

Officers were first notified that a woman was armed with a knife outside of a security checkpoint at 4:45 p.m. She stabbed an adult male before engaging with officers. “During the encounter the female suspect stabbed an adult female and then an APD lieutenant as he attempted to take her into custody. Another officer was then able to tackle and disarm the female and take her into custody.”
All victims are conscious and have been taken to the hospital. The suspect has been taken to the airport precinct, and an investigation is underway.

We have a winner!
Bear 128 Grazer topped 32 Chunk to become Fat Bear Week 2023 champion.
This is 128 Grazer’s first win, though she has been a familiar presence for years on the Brooks River at Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska. She has even earned a reputation among fellow bears.
“Grazer is a particularly defensive mother bear who has successfully raised two litters of cubs,” according to Fat Bear Week’s website. “She often preemptively confronts and attacks much larger bears – even large and dominant adult males – in order to ensure her cubs are safe.”
Katami noted many bears remembered 128 Grazer and steered clear this summer, even though she wasn't looking after cubs
“Even though she's a female, (she) is one of the dominant bears on the river, and she's probably the best angler we have,” Naomi Boak, a media ranger at the national park, told USA TODAY. “She's huge, just huge.”
Fat Bear Week’s champion isn’t necessarily the fattest bear at Katmai. The March Madness-style bracket competition is based on popular vote, cast online by fans all over the world. 
All the contenders are winners because they’ve all packed on pounds, gorging themselves on the Brooks River’s bountiful salmon before hibernating for the winter.
Disney fans who may have been holding off on booking their vacations may have to pay a little more than expected.
Prices for parking and annual passes rose overnight at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. Some ticket prices and other costs also increased Wednesday at Disneyland.
"We are constantly adding new, innovative attractions and entertainment to our parks and, with our broad array of pricing options, the value of a theme park visit is reflected in the unique experiences that only Disney can offer,” a Disney spokesperson said in a statement.
The changes come on the same day as a long-awaiting announcement about park hopper rules at Disney World.
Here's what Disney World and Disneyland visitors should know.
Starting Jan. 9, Disney World guests will once again be able to park hop at any time of day during park hours, pending capacity, the Florida resort announced Wednesday.
Currently, guests must wait until 2 p.m to change parks if they've purchase the park hopper option for their tickets.
The change will take effect the same day as two other highly anticipated moves, the lifting of reservation requirements for most Disney World guests and the return of the prepaid Disney Dining Plan.
Disney World 4 Parks in 1 Day challenge:19,338 steps later, my husband and I agreed we'd do it again
As of Wednesday, standard parking prices costs $30, instead of $25, at Disney World’s theme parks. 
That’s the same price as the starting parking price at SeaWorld Orlando and regular parking price at Universal Orlando Resort.
Parking is free for guests staying at Disney’s resort hotels. It’s also free for Disney Springs guests while they are visiting the shopping, dining and entertainment complex – not theme parks.
The prices of all four annual passes also jumped overnight.
Existing annual pass holders can renew at special, reduced prices. 
There are no changes to prices for standard, dated tickets, which are the kind of tickets most guests have at Disney World.
Disney World previously announced the introduction of “good-to-go” dates, when annual pass holders and cast members may visit parks without reservations. The resort has now revealed that “good-to-go” dates will begin rolling out in January and be released on a periodic basis after that.
On non-”good-to-go” dates, annual pass holders and cast members will still need a reservation for their starting park, if they enter before 2 p.m.
The starting price of one-day, one-park adult tickets remains $104 at Disneyland, as it has been for several years. However, prices of higher-tier tickets rose by $5 to $15 on Wednesday.
Ticket prices now top out at $194 for one day at Disneyland or Disney California Adventure. That's $15 more than the previous price of $179 for the highest-demand dates at the Southern California resort. For comparison, the most expensive one-day, one-park tickets at Disney World cost $189 for Magic Kingdom.
The price of multi-day tickets also jumped on Wednesday.
Park hopping costs extra. It's still $65 to add park hopping to a one-day ticket. However, on Wednesday, the park hopper add-on rose between $5 to $15 for multi-day tickets.
Disneyland is offering limited-time discounts on kids' tickets next year. From Jan. 8 through March 10, the price of a child's ticket will be "as low as $50 per child, per day," the resort announced last week. Only kids between 3 and 9 qualify for children's tickets. Guests aged 10 and up count as adults, while children under 3 may enter parks for free.
Story continues below.
Disneyland's version of annual passes, known as Magic Keys, also rose Wednesday as much as $150.
None of the Magic Keys are currently available for new purchases, but existing Magic Key holders can renew them.
To make the most of Magic Key benefits, Magic Key holders can check out the new Magic Keys Extra Unlocked section of Disneyland's app and website, which lists exclusive perks like a complimentary holiday tote bag available next month, while supplies last.
The price of theme park and hotel parking rose by $5 across the board on Wednesday. Hourly rates, however, remain flat for guests visiting Downtown Disney and not the parks.
The cost of pre-purchasing Genie+ also rose Wednesday from $25 to $30. That's the same as the starting price of purchasing Genie+ on the day of a park visit. Day-of pricing varies by demand.
Not only can Genie+ help guests cut down waits for select attractions, but unlike at Disney World, Disneyland's Genie+ includes unlimited PhotoPass downloads. Starting Wednesday, the service also includes Disneyland's newest attraction, Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway. Ariel's Undersea Adventure will be included in Genie+ in November.
UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay.
Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports.
Their partnership should have been a force for good. Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.
The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.
Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.
But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.
According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.
“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”
In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”
“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”
Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.
The stakes are high for everyone.
Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.
Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.
Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.
Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.
“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”
USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.
Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.
For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.
Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.
For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.
“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”
Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.
Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.
At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.
By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.
Tucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.
Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline
Tucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.
Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.
Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.
Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.
During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.
They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.
In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”
It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.
Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.
Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.
They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.
Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.
By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.
Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.
Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”
Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.
Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.
Twelve days later came the call.
Tracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.
According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.
“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”
Tracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”
She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.
“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”
Tracy said she thought to herself, "Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it." In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”
When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.
Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.
Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.
At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.
Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.
When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.
Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.
Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”
Tucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.
The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.
Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.
She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.
Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.
“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”
The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.
A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.
Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.
Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.
Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.
Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.
Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.
“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.
Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.
Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.
Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.
Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.
They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.
“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”
Michigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.
The case would go forward.
Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22.
He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.
For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.
Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.
An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.
Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.
During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”
Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.
“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”
Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.
Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.
Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.
Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.
At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.
Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.
Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”
Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.
One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.
A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”
“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”

On a sunny Thursday morning, Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker strolled through tomato fields at a farm in Immokalee, Florida, toured its processing plants and loaded baskets of bright green fruit into a truck. 
It was a private event thrown by the school to promote its migrant student services program, which provides financial aid and support to farmworkers seeking college degrees. After the April 28, 2022, tour, disclosed in records obtained by USA TODAY this week, Tucker met with community leaders and alumni.
That night, Tucker would make the now-infamous phone call from his hotel room in nearby Naples, during which he is accused of masturbating and making unwanted sexual comments to Brenda Tracy, a prominent rape survivor and activist he had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence.
Yet, when Tucker met with the university’s outside investigator in March for his interview in the sexual harassment case against him, he insisted the trip was not work-related – a claim the investigator would disprove in her report.
It’s just one example of Tucker failing to keep his story straight at the most consequential moment of his career. 
With his job, reputation and the roughly $80 million left on his contract at stake, Tucker repeatedly made false statements to the investigator and misled her about basic facts, such as his location during the phone call and the date it occurred, a USA TODAY review of more than 1,200 pages of case documents found. 
The investigator, Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, and the news organization both obtained documents and witness statements that discredit key aspects of Tucker’s version of events. 
Michigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sept. 10, hours after Tracy went public for the first time with her story in USA TODAY. On Monday, the school informed Tucker it plans to fire him for cause based on the conduct he had admitted to and the embarrassment he had caused the school. 
Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivor
Although Tucker denied sexually harassing Tracy, he acknowledged masturbating on the call, saying he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex.” Tracy said Tucker’s romantic interest in her was completely one-sided and that she had tried to set boundaries multiple times during their yearlong business partnership.
Per his contract, Tucker has until Tuesday to make a case for keeping his job. Regardless, a formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated school policies against sexual harassment and exploitation is expected to proceed on Oct. 5 and 6. 
Since his suspension, Tucker has issued multiple public statements defending himself, attacking Tracy and accusing Veidlinger of bias. He accused the school of conducting a “sham” hearing and having “ulterior motives.” Yet even in these written statements, the central details of his story changed entirely.
Tucker, who previously hung up on a reporter who called him on his cellphone asking about the case, did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. His attorney, Jennifer Belveal, has not responded to phone calls and emails. Tracy declined to comment for this story.
In the absence of eyewitnesses or recordings, sexual harassment cases usually boil down to whose account is more credible, said Elizabeth Abdnour, a Lansing-based attorney and former Michigan State Title IX investigator who has taken part in dozens of campus cases.
“It’s very, very unusual that you would have some outside piece of evidence that would give you a clear decision,” Abdnour said. “Very often you’re weighing credibility based on little bits and pieces of information.” 
In multiple cases she has worked, Abdnour said the respondents lost because they were found to have a greater propensity for lying than the complainants. The hearing officer must determine how much weight to give Tucker’s false and conflicting statements, Abdnour said, and they could sway the case in Tracy’s favor.
“I believe a fact finder could assess these pieces of evidence about credibility and make a determination that Brenda is more credible than Mel,” she said. “In my experience, a clear sign of a lack of credibility is generally taken very seriously.”
By the time Tucker met with Veidlinger for his interview, he had had months to prepare.
The school had informed him of Tracy’s complaint on Dec. 22, the day after she filed it. Veidlinger had interviewed Tracy and all six of her witnesses by the end of January. Tucker was the only holdout.
Rather than tell his side of the story right away, Tucker and his attorney spent three months trying to stop the investigation, case documents show. They wrote legal arguments urging Michigan State to drop the case and twice approached Tracy’s attorney proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no, and the school pressed forward.
On March 22, the day of his interview, Tucker sent Veidlinger a seven-page written account of his interactions with Tracy and lists of their “currently existing” text message and call history, which he said his legal team had compiled. Only a handful of text messages remained; he and Tracy both told the investigator they had deleted their texts with each other in the months after the April 2022 phone call.
In his interview, which lasted 3 ½ hours, Tucker questioned whether Tracy had mixed up the date of the call. He said he recalled being at his home in East Lansing when it occurred, but his own records showed that he had been in Florida on April 28, attending a charity function that was “absolutely not a University-sponsored event.”
His seven-page account told a different story – that he had called her while he was “alone in a hotel room.”
Veidlinger does not appear to have asked Tucker about the discrepancy, based on case documents. But by then she knew what he told her in the interview was untrue: she had already obtained records proving he had not been home in East Lansing.
An expense report he had submitted to the university for reimbursement of his hotel and meals shows Tucker flew to Naples, Florida, to attend a golf fundraiser hosted by The Greg H. Montgomery Jr. Foundation for Ultimate Growth, which raises awareness for suicide prevention. It showed he stayed at the Hilton from April 27 to 29, that the trip’s purpose was “administrative” and that it did not involve personal travel. He had flown there on a donor’s private plane.
The trip is when Tucker toured the farm in Immokalee to help promote Michigan State’s College Assistance Migrant Program. The event was titled “Working to make dreams a reality,” according to an agenda obtained from the university by USA TODAY through a public records request. The agenda features Tucker’s name prominently. Tucker posted photos from the tour on his Twitter account.
That Tucker was on a university-sponsored work trip during the incident was a contributing factor in the university’s determination that it had jurisdiction to investigate, the investigation report shows. 
Tucker’s lists of calls and text messages also were missing an important detail: They did not show any communication with Tracy on April 28. He acknowledged in the interview, however, that he had not reviewed the lists before submitting them and that they may have been incomplete.
Tracy, meanwhile, had already provided Veidlinger with her official cellphone records from Sprint that confirmed the date of their call: April 28.
Tucker and Tracy did not speak in the three months after the April 28 call.
Meanwhile, their assistants were planning Tracy’s third visit to campus – an in-person training with coaches and players scheduled for July 25.
Tucker canceled that training three days before, the investigation report shows. When Tracy spoke to him by phone on Aug. 2 seeking to find out why, she would tell the investigator in her interview that Tucker insinuated he would harm her career if she spoke about his conduct. He never rescheduled her visit, and they never spoke again.
The cancellation became a key focus of the investigator – one of a series of alleged incidents that taken together would meet the definition of sexual harassment, which can include pressuring someone into engaging in sexual behavior for an employment benefit and threatening that rejecting such behavior will carry a negative consequence.
“Reported allegations that a University employee is engaging in misconduct within the vendor-vendee relationship for which they are the decision-maker, and/or impeding in such a services relationship based on a quid-pro-quo sexual harassment allegation, is within a University sponsored program or activity,” Veidlinger wrote in the report, so school policy covered it.
Tucker tried to distance himself from the cancellation in a public statement on Sept. 11, the day after Michigan State suspended him without pay.
“I never cancelled any presentation,” he wrote. “Given a personnel change and scheduling challenges as football season approached, we merely postponed it until January 2023. She chose to file her complaint instead of proceeding with the training.”
But that statement contradicts what he told the investigator. When Veidlinger asked in his March interview if he had a role in canceling Tracy’s visit, Tucker said, “Yes, absolutely I did,” the report shows, and that he did not recall any discussions about rescheduling Tracy for January. Such timing would not make sense, he added, because most of his new players would not yet be on campus. 
Tucker also told the investigator why he canceled the visit, blaming it on a scheduling conflict. He said he had recently hired a mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, who needed to implement his new program on short notice. There was limited time in fall camp, Tucker said, and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” the players. He said he decided to yield the time to Newman.
Veidlinger, however, would later obtain records showing Newman did not meet with the team on July 25, the day of Tracy’s planned visit. He had been meeting with them weekly since June 6, the records showed but held no meetings between July 15 and July 28.
One of Tucker’s assistants, who is a witness in the case, also told the investigator that Tucker asked him via text message to cancel it. He said he was never instructed to reschedule. 
In his interview, Tucker told Veidlinger that his relationship with Tracy frayed after the April 2022 phone call – not because of the incident, but because of information he learned after that caused him not to trust her.
According to Tucker, an associate of his had told him over the summer that Tracy’s assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, had been gossiping about Tucker’s marriage, telling others it was “on the rocks.” Tucker said he was “devastated” because he had confided in Tracy about his marital problems, and he believed she had discussed them with Alvarado.
Tucker confronted Tracy about the alleged gossiping during the Aug. 2 phone call, they both told the investigator. Tracy said he berated and bullied her, repeatedly saying he could not trust her. She said she told him she did not know what he was talking about.
Alvarado – who was killed in a car crash in June – would deny discussing Tucker’s marriage with anyone in her January interview with Veidlinger. 
During the Aug. 2 call, Tracy said she pressed Tucker to identify his source – the associate. She told Veidlinger she believed Tucker had made it up as a pretext for canceling her visit and ending her relationship with the school.
Veidlinger also asked Tucker to reveal the source of his claim, but he refused to say. In her report, she wrote that he said he had “given (his) word that (he) wouldn’t divulge their name.” 
Tucker never revealed the associate’s name to the investigator, nor did he identify anyone who could support his version of events. In his Sept. 11 public statement, however, he lamented that the hearing would not afford him the opportunity to “offer any substantive evidence of innocence.”
It was not the only claim he attributed to his anonymous associate. In his interview, he said that same person told him that ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating how Tracy “goes about her business” by claiming to be a rape survivor.  
Tucker said this further caused him to believe Tracy was untrustworthy because she believed Lavigne was her friend but didn’t know she was investigating the rape story at the center of her public persona. 
It turned out to be yet another falsehood.
Reached by USA TODAY, Lavigne said in an emailed statement that she was “perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.” She said Tracy has been a source of information for her for several years, and that she has featured Tracy’s comments and advocacy work in multiple news stories.
“That has been the extent of my reporting on Tracy and her organization,” Lavigne wrote. “Neither the organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting.”
Asked who might have told Tucker this misinformation, Lavigne responded, “I have absolutely no idea who would have alleged this to anyone.”

The bullets came in plywood crates. 
Any given box was about the size of a small microwave oven. The printed label stuck to each one demonstrated a militaristic brevity. “CARTRIDGES FOR WEAPONS, INERT PROJECTILE,” next to a bright yellow hazmat sticker, “EXPLOSIVES.” 
Inside the boxes: drab green steel cans of .50-caliber ammunition. Each round was giant, more than 5 inches long, built to be fired from a gun so big it is typically bolted to a truck. The bullets were clipped together in long strands for rapid, machine-gun fire. 
By the time Bill Brown got to the boxes, they sat double-stacked eight high atop wooden pallets inside a Missouri warehouse. The pallets went on, row after row. Three million bullets in all. 
It was enough ammunition to feed a single machine gun – if fired nonstop at its rated speed eight hours a day, seven days a week – for almost six months. 
Brown’s job was to get it out of there and toward the Ukrainian front lines. The faster, the better. 
“War is bad,” Brown said. “Loss of life is bad. But at the end of the day, it’s very profitable and injects revenue into this military industrial base.”
There would be virtually no public record of this Ukrainian arms shipment. As a weapons dealer, Brown’s company would deliver the bullets under a system known as a direct commercial sale. The ammunition required a State Department signoff – but the secret deal would never appear in a White House announcement or the Congressional Record. 
Instead, it was part of a shadowy system of brokers, exporters, arms dealers and country-to-country transfers that has become one part of the race to meet demand on distant battlefields. 
Western weaponry fueled Ukraine’s summertime counteroffensive along a 600-mile front. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the effort was delayed in part by the wait for more arms. Amid concerns about that slowly progessing counteroffensive, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday with a promise of up to $175 million more in military equipment. 
Most of America’s $44 billion in documented support to Ukraine came in the form of old U.S. military stock, donated directly by the federal government. In general, commercial sales over $14 million, and sales of military-grade weaponry like mortars or missiles, require State Department approval and congressional notification.
But other aid comes via private sales. 
More than 14,000 U.S. entities are registered to conduct defense trade activities. Their deals are monitored by an alphabet soup of agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Trade secrecy clauses in federal law mean this flow of gear, weapons and ammunition is almost never revealed to the public.
Brown, who works for a small Nevada-based logistics company called Battle Born Munitions, provided USA TODAY with a rare look behind the curtain of these private sales. Details about the shipment were verified by his employer and the European government that made the purchase. State Department officials declined to answer questions about the specific shipment Brown described.
This March sale and the secret number of other shipments like it fuel Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion. Those sales also release an unknown amount of weaponry into the world. What becomes of that weaponry after it’s sold – and especially after it’s delivered – is difficult to track. 
As Brown surveyed the warehouse in Missouri, a crew steered forklifts and skid lifts among the stacks of plain wooden boxes. From high in the trusses, suspended lamp fixtures bathed the boxes in artificial daylight. Brown lifted his camera and started snapping photos. 
In just a few hours, he and his cargo would be boarding a jumbo jet. Three million bullets would climb to the stratosphere and hurtle across the north Atlantic toward a European dawn.
From Ukraine:War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented. So is the country's push for swift justice.
The bullets had once been bound for Saudi Arabia. 
Lot number SMQ19K401L026 had rolled off the assembly line in 2019 at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Kansas City. Lake City, owned by the government and run by a contractor, sprawls across nearly 4,000 acres of green Missouri farmland. Roads curve past World War II-era bunkers known as igloos, spaced out amid the countryside – far enough apart that an explosion in one won’t trigger a chain reaction in the others.
Lake City has been pumping out ammunition almost without pause since 1941. It is the largest small-arms manufacturing plant in the world.
Today the plant is run by Olin-Winchester, but in 2019, the bullets were made by some of the 1,700 workers employed by Northrop Grumman. And in 2019, Saudi Arabia was stocking up on weapons during the Trump administration, fueling the war in Yemen and other conflicts that drew criticism from congressional Democrats.
The plant manufactures .50-caliber ammunition on a rolling basis, for both military and commercial buyers. That’s a testament to just what a legend the bullet – and the gun that shoots it – has become.
In 2019, the technology was already a century old. The .50 caliber was the brainchild of American gunsmith John Browning during World War I. Built to respond to German anti-tank rifles, the M2 was first tested in 1918, and it entered widespread service in 1923. It earned the nickname “Ma Deuce” and has served in combat ever since, bolted to trucks, ships, planes and handheld stands on the battlefield.
The .50-caliber rounds – named for their diameter, about half an inch – can easily hit targets more than a mile away. At closer ranges, they will blast through solid concrete or armored vehicles. The gun can fire at a sustained rate of about 40 shots per minute.
Military setups use strings of “linked” ammunition to feed into machine guns. Spaced out after every fourth bullet, so-called tracer rounds have small pyrotechnic charges that illuminate the line of fire, aiding in targeting.
The gun’s longevity and versatility made it popular for militaries the world over. But this particular batch of bullets wouldn’t end up being sold to Saudi Arabia. 
The Biden administration put a temporary freeze on sales to the Saudi government in 2021 as it reviewed weapons deals approved under Donald Trump. Instead, Brown said, the bullets were sold to a U.S. ammunition provider, only to be held up again. Ultimately, they were mothballed. 
Then, in spring 2023, the bullets found a buyer, or actually two: first Battle Born; ultimately, the Netherlands. 
The European country, a NATO ally, needed a big supply of ammunition. It wouldn’t be keeping the bullets but giving them to Ukraine. Its purchase, essentially a donation, would count toward the country’s required NATO contribution. 
Brown had a line on exactly what they needed. It was sitting in the warehouse in Missouri. 
He arrived in March to personally oversee the shipment. As he prepped for delivery, Brown dropped tiny black tracking devices onto several of the pallets. Just $55 apiece, the units use GPS and cell signals to keep tabs on the load. The idea was to ensure it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands. 
But packing up the bullets was just the beginning. As with anything that’s deadly and made of metal, the shipping costs can be extreme. 
Brown said the question for the buyer was simple: “How fast do you want it? Forty-five to 60 days on a ship? Or in five days if I fly it?”
Brown – or Chief Bill, as he prefers – is a no-nonsense 35-year veteran of the U.S. Army and former helicopter pilot. He retired as a chief warrant officer and lives in Orlando. 
Now 59, he still spends a lot of time on the road – 10 international trips this year. He says his arms logistics work takes him to places most Americans would rather avoid – near the Syrian border or to unstable regions of Iraq.
He’ll travel halfway around the world, he quips, “have some soup, and go back to Warsaw to head home.” The trips aren’t really about the destinations. They’re about the cargo. 
On that spring day in Missouri, forklifts carefully loaded 107 pallets of the ammo onto 18 flatbed semitrailers. They’d all make the eight-hour drive to O’Hare International Airport. 
In Chicago, two Boeing 747-400s operated by National Airlines would be ready for the freight. 
Four pallets each were stacked and shrink-wrapped to create “air pallets” or “cookie sheets” weighing 12,800 pounds. Each plane could carry up to 17 of the pallets that ran the length of each plane secured by white cargo netting.
Flight records Brown provided show the two planes departed about seven hours apart, one in early afternoon, one after dark. 
The flight would take nine hours. Brown wasn’t going to the Netherlands, even though it was the buyer. The planes were bound for Rzeszów, Poland. 
The ancient city sits at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland. It has a gleaming modern airport next to a major east-west freeway. From there, it’s barely 60 miles to the border with Ukraine. 
It was an expensive journey. The trucking company’s bill for those 18 semis? $85,000. Chartering the two 747s? $625,000. Each.
But this shipment of .50-cal rounds was profitable for Battle Born Munitions, according to Brown.
The company purchased the 3 million rounds from Northrop Grumman at a bargain and resold them for more than double the price. (In subsequent interviews, representatives at BBM disputed the specific totals Brown mentioned, saying the accurate figures were protected by “various commercial and government non-disclosure agreements.” They did not dispute the other specifics of the deal he provided.) 
Retail prices for .50-caliber ammunition run roughly $5 per bullet. At that rate, the whole shipment would have been worth $15 million.
The pricing might also be elastic. The Dutch mark up the price of the bullets and count it toward their NATO contribution, pegged to a percentage of gross domestic product, Brown said. The Netherlands has contributed about $15 billion to NATO this year, or about 1.7% of its GDP and just under the NATO mandate of 2%.
Representatives of the Dutch military confirmed the shipment to USA TODAY but declined to comment further about the pricing or details.
The war in Ukraine has only increased the demand for private deals. The State Department signed off on more than $154 billion in commercial arms deals directly to foreign countries in 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year. 
Direct commercial sales represent a modest portion of the contribution to Ukraine compared with the $44 billion donated by the U.S., but they still amounted to more than $600 million in sales from U.S. companies to the Ukrainian government last year alone. That doesn’t include sales to other countries that also support Ukraine – sales like the one Brown described.
Jim Bartlett, an attorney with expertise in the specialized international arms transactions, said private U.S. businesses are playing a small but important role in the conflict.
“American companies are happy to export defense articles to foreign buyers approved by the U.S. State Department,” Bartlett said. “There’s an effort at the State Department to quickly clear the ones headed for Ukraine. … You get head-of-the-line privileges.”
Those sales also come with risks. 
Direct sales face fewer regulatory controls, oversight and enforcement, said Robert Nichols, an international military sales expert and attorney at the law firm Nichols Liu.
“You can imagine the range of characters involved in supplying a war effort,” Nichols said. “Some are highly credible. Others will skirt the law and sometimes step over the line by paying bribes, committing fraud and hiding their transactions.” 
So far, the Department of Justice has indicted just a handful of arms brokers over deals related to the war in Ukraine. Court records show the government has charged Miami-based Oleg Patsulya and Vasilii Besedin with illegally attempting to sell American-made aircraft parts to Russia. They allegedly lied to Commerce Department agents and told them the parts were bound for Turkey. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges this summer. 
A State Department spokesman declined to provide details of enforcement actions but said, “The United States takes seriously our responsibility to protect American military and dual-use technologies and prevent their diversion, including through strong enforcement actions.”
NATO said it oversees allied arms deliveries, and that those arms generally reach Ukraine. NATO itself technically only provides non-non-lethal aid, like fuel, medical supplies and generators.
Brown, of Battle Born, says he fields calls weekly from “clowns” without the proper licensing, whom he reports to the State Department for potential violations. Some raise red flags when they approach him about transactions that include payment via diamonds or gold.
He prefers traditional wire transfers with approved sales partners since he knows government officials are watching. He validates the contracts and checks certificates for the final users. That’s part of why he traveled with the ammunition. He would be meeting a Dutch military official for the official handoff.
“My job is to keep us all out of jail,” Brown said. 
The two 747s touched down in Poland, one before the sun, the other in late morning. Brown exchanged paperwork with a young Dutch military staffer who signed for the delivery, he said. They traded military patches as souvenirs. They snapped a photo together. 
The bullets bought by the Netherlands would never touch Dutch soil. 
U.S. aid:Billions from the US flows to Ukraine. Here's where it comes from, and how it adds up
Despite playing a small role proportionately in the war, $600 million in direct commercial sales can buy a lot of small weaponry. 
And those weapons are the kind most apt to fall into illicit use, said Elias Yousif, a research analyst at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit think tank.
Put another way: It’s hard to sneak away an F-16 or a missile launcher the size of a tractor-trailer. But a bunch of guns or a pallet of ammo? Much easier to resell. 
“In the commercial sector, especially in a new market, the risk increases,” Yousif said.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss arms research project, estimated that within a year, battlefield seizures and other forms of diversion led to 300,000 small arms and light weapons going missing, including 100,000 in Crimea alone.
When small arms go missing, they can go missing into another country, maybe one led by a despot or even a terrorist organization.
The U.S. government says diversion of American donations has been widely absent so far in Ukraine. That could be a combination of intensive “end-use-monitoring” programs and the reality of the battlefield, where supplies are rapidly put to use.
But even if not now, unused ammo could be resold someday. 
“History shows us this isn’t a short-term issue,” Yousif said.  “These are commodities with very long shelf lives.” 
Florida-based Global Ordnance, another State Department-licensed exporter, is a competitor in the direct weapons sales business. General counsel Bryan Van Brunt said the company has extensive protocols in place to track shipments and make sure the end-users are federally approved, though he declined to provide specifics about those systems. 
Brown, with Battle Born Munitions, says the company employs a mix of simple and sophisticated tracking technology to ensure his shipments are tracked to end users. The black GPS devices he dropped onto his cargo tracked the ammo all the way across the globe.
But that system only works as long as Brown is actually tracking. “Technically, my role ends when I deliver it to NATO,” he said.
Sometime after the 747s touched down in Poland, along with signing the paperwork and snapping a selfie with the Dutch official, Brown found the tiny black GPS trackers and lifted them off the pallets. 
Ukrainian trucks would arrive at the airport to pick up the ammunition. They would point toward the border, and onward to Lviv, and some distant battlefield. 
Brown would point in the opposite direction. Just like one of his quips: Fly in, have soup, get home. He headed toward Warsaw, with the GPS trackers in his bag.

The geography professor didn’t hide his clown fetish or the fact that he sometimes indulged his urges by recruiting students as subjects. He posted regularly about it on social media.
“I have a facepaint fetish and convince the cute girls in my classes to let me paint their faces,” he once wrote.
Yet Joseph Tokosh held jobs at two colleges and was on the tenure track at a third before student journalists at Nicholls State University in Louisiana exposed his behavior. He submitted his resignation the same day their story was published.
His interactions with students and open discussion of his fetish happened in both mainstream and tailored digital spaces. He popped into Facebook groups geared toward new students and niche forums on websites like Reddit. He posted videos on YouTube. In one Reddit post on a forum meant to highlight hard-to-believe stories, Tokosh posted pictures of several women in white face paint.
Over the years, two students reported him to campus police; others complained online. He left Kent State University after pleading no contest to something different: a theft charge that involved entering his peers’ offices without permission and taking a USB drive. Tokosh has not been charged with any other crime.
Tokosh’s career trajectory exposes inadequacies in the background check system that colleges and universities are supposed to have in place to protect students – especially when evidence of the concerning behavior resides largely on the internet. Nicholls State, for example, told USA TODAY Network reporters it does not routinely check social media for new hires.
A federal law intended to ensure the academic privacy of students also makes it difficult to determine how Tokosh was able to move so freely from campus to campus. Both Kent State and Northern Illinois University – where he taught while finishing his doctorate – noted Tokosh’s protected status as a graduate student in declining to answer questions.
Sophie Levan was a freshman at Kent State in 2017 when she encountered Tokosh, then 28, in a Facebook group intended as a gathering place for new students. Tokosh had offered cash to anyone willing to let him paint their faces. Levan, then 18, agreed.
The money was appealing but the interactions soured. 
Tokosh, she said, insisted he come pick her up and take her to the building that housed the geography department, where he would paint her face. Uneasy, Levan stopped responding. Tokosh got angry and wouldn’t give up, she said, which led her to file a police report.
“I felt like the school would want to know about it,” Levan said. “I thought maybe they could prevent anything bad from happening since other girls would go with him.”
She said there was never any followup from campus police – or anyone else.
USA TODAY Network reporters reviewed the experiences of six students who were the subject of Tokosh’s attention going back to his time at Kent State.
In addition to Levan, the other person who reported Tokosh to campus police could not be reached for comment. The two who expressed public concerns on social media told USA TODAY they never heard from their campus officials either.
USA TODAY attempted to reach Tokosh via phone, social media and a certified letter. A person answered a phone call to a number associated with Tokosh, but he hung up after the reporter identified himself. A reporter also reached someone who identified herself as Tokosh’s mother. She said she would pass along that reporters were trying to reach him.
Tokosh told the Nicholls student journalists that he did have an assignment where students were required to paint their faces as part of a cultural exercise. Prior to the article in the student newspaper The Nicholls Worth, the university had already cut Tokosh loose. He said his contract was not renewed because he was the target of a “grade inflation task force.”
The university, however, “does not have any such task force,” according to Nicholls spokesman Jerad David.
Tokosh also told students the face painting was a requirement in his cultural geography class to better understand other cultures. In a video interview with Hannah Robert, the station manager for the student-run KNSU TV, he says: “That's an assignment in one of my classes where they actually come up with their own face paint and makeup design inspired by a culture and they implement it.”
It’s a well-established trend in the academic world for professors to bounce from one institution to another without having to disclose why they left their last post, said Julie Libarkin, an associate dean at Michigan State University. She has seen the pattern often in her work maintaining a database of publicly documented sexual misconduct by faculty and staff.
As for grad students? Libarkin said people have requested she add them to her list, but universities’ conservative interpretations of the law get in the way.
“I don’t on purpose,” she said, “because that’s information that almost never comes out.”
Tokosh arrived at Kent State in 2015 with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in geography from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, according to his curriculum vitae. He was working toward his doctorate and researched fading businesses. His work about shopping malls in the Rust Belt won several awards. Like many graduate students, he also taught classes.
Then, Tokosh started showing up in the Facebook groups for new students. In a December 2017 post, an account under the name “Joe Tokosh” posted several pictures of women made up to look like clowns or skulls.
“If anyone is looking for some extra cash, I am looking for people to practice facepainting on!” he wrote. “I will literally pay you!”
Those are the types of posts that caught Levan’s eye. Not only was she pressed for cash, she was interested in movie makeup and thought the face painting could be fun based on the photos Tokosh had posted. But Levan said she soon realized that those images were stock photos and not representative of what Tokosh could do.
What’s more, she figured out that he was a graduate student, a fact she said he didn’t disclose in his posts.
When Tokosh offered to pick her up from her dorm, she refused. But, she said, Tokosh kept insisting she agreed to participate. Levan stopped responding to his messages and filed a police report with the Kent State police in January 2018. They advised her only to stop talking to Tokosh, she said, and let them know if “anything of consequence occurred.”
Months after she refused to meet up and filed the police report, Tokosh texted a picture of himself wearing white face paint to her cellphone. It arrived at midnight and contained no message, although writing on his shirt read: “I'm not a failure.”  
“There was some negative intention with sending that photo,” Levan said. “It’s definitely burned into my mind.”
What Levan didn’t know is that campus police had been put on notice a year earlier when another student filed a similar report. That student told police Tokosh reached out to her and her friends after they posted their numbers on a Facebook group for undergraduates. He would send “get to know you” messages, the police report said, and then ask the student if she was “interested in having her face painted for one of his class projects.”
When she found out Tokosh was a graduate student, she said no and eventually blocked him on Facebook and Snapchat, according to the report. Tokosh continued to text her.
“She does not have any concerns for her safety, but just wanted this documented,” the police report read. 
In July 2017, another student had retweeted a message from Kent State’s Twitter account that asked for Kent State love stories. She wrote: “A geography professor requested me on facebook and asked if he could paint my face like a clown.”
The student confirmed to USA TODAY that the professor was Tokosh and shared a screenshot of a Facebook friend request he sent her. She said she suspected Tokosh also found her on a freshman Facebook group because she posted there often.
She said she tweeted to draw officials’ attention to it and moved on but now wishes she had reported it officially.
College campuses are supposed to offer students special protections from sexual harassment even when it falls short of criminal behavior. Title IX, often associated with equity in women’s sports, also addresses “sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence” at schools that receive federal funding.
Colleges infrequently and unevenly enforce the rule, however. A 2022 USA TODAY investigation found just one of every 12,400 students was suspended in connection with sexual misconduct.
The student who shared her story online said the only response she received was from a graduate student in the geography department, who contacted her on Oct. 1, 2018. In an email, he wrote that he had seen her post and suspected he knew which faculty member had asked her about face painting.
“I brought it to the attention of some of our faculty because I was pretty sure I knew who it was, but they were certain it wasn’t that individual and that you probably just meant geology,” he wrote. 
He went on to reference another student being “approached in (at least by just looking at your tweet) a much more aggressive way.” The grad student asked the undergraduate for more information, but, she told USA TODAY, she didn’t respond. She said she started drafting a reply, but a year had passed. She wanted to move on.
Kent State would not say whether any actions were taken after the students’ reports, but Eric Mansfield, a spokesman for the university, said the police department confirmed that the students who filed police reports were provided with “university resources, which would include other non-criminal avenues to pursue (Counseling Services, Title IX, Center for Sexual and Relationship Violence Services, etc.) as a general police practice.”
Levan does not recall police offering her services, but she said she didn’t want counseling. She wanted Tokosh investigated.
Mansfield also said that the university monitors social media but that colleges “can’t always see or track every mention on social media.”
Police records show that officers did investigate when Tokosh was accused of breaking into geography department offices. A blotter item in the local newspaper shows police obtained an arrest warrant in connection with a third-degree felony burglary charge. Court documents indicate Tokosh pleaded no contest to a theft on Oct. 19, 2018.
Kent State would not explain what led to Tokosh’s departure during that fall semester. Instead, the university said that since Tokosh was a graduate student, any information about him was protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It also would not say whether school officials shared Tokosh’s disciplinary record with other colleges or even if it was standard practice to do so for grad students.
“Due to FERPA, student education records are private,” said Emily Vincent, a university spokeswoman. “Also, we do not comment on personnel matters.”
When Congress passed FERPA in 1974, its author, Sen. James L. Buckley of New York, said the intent was to protect the academic privacy of students and their families. In more recent years, Buckley has become critical of the law and how schools interpret it. He told the Columbus Dispatch in 2010 that “the law needs to be revamped.”
Survivors of sexual violence and students accuse universities of using the law to avoid negative media coverage. Students with a history of bad behavior may jump from one school to another without the public ever knowing about their histories. Law enforcement records don’t fall under FERPA’s purview, but a wide variety of questionable behavior does.
One case involved Brandon Austin, who was accused of sexual assault at Providence College in 2013 while on the school’s basketball team. But Providence College initially said Austin was suspended for violating the school’s code of student conduct and declined to share further details with the Providence Journal, citing federal privacy laws. Austin denied wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime. 
Austin was able to transfer to the University of Oregon, where he was again accused of sexual assault, along with other players. Police investigated the claims, and the local district attorney declined to press charges. The university expelled him anyway but raised FERPA when it declined to release records showing what Oregon knew about the allegations, according to the Oregonian.
LeRoy Rooker was the director of the U.S. Education Department office that oversaw FERPA for more than two decades. Rooker, now a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said FERPA is not a confidentiality law – it is focused on education records. And it doesn’t apply when a student is “seeking or intending to enroll” at another college.
Therefore, Rooker said, Kent State could have shared information about Tokosh with Northern Illinois.
Rooker also said FERPA would not have prevented Kent State from telling reporters if other universities had inquired about Tokosh, though they could not have disclosed what they shared.
He blamed the overuse of the law on fear of being sued.
“In this litigious age, institutions get a little wonky about whether they will forward, say, disciplinary records,” Rooker said. “On the other hand, if you have something and you don’t share it when you can and something happens at the next institution, I would say that’s a big liability.”
Backgrounding job applicants has become increasingly complex.
While most U.S. employers conduct background screening, according to trade group data, those inquiries typically focus on criminal history. Social media receives far less attention even though that is where people are most likely to share their unguarded thoughts.
Undertaking a full review of a person’s social media presence is more difficult than just checking an applicant’s Facebook page.
Does an applicant have an account on X, formerly Twitter? How about an account with Discord, an online platform frequented by gamers, where leaked Pentagon documents were recently shared? Or what about a Telegram account, a messaging platform popular among white nationalists? Further complicating things, it’s common on sites like Reddit for users to adopt usernames and describe experiences with little to no ties to reality.
A little digging, however, can turn up a lot of dirt.  
Tokosh has a LinkedIn page that includes his teaching stints at Northern Illinois University and Nicholls State University. His time as a student and instructor at Kent State is absent.
For LinkedIn, a custom URL includes a play on his name and his chosen field of study: Joeography. Tokosh would later use that moniker in promotional materials for a class at Nicholls State. That is the same handle used on Reddit by someone with a special interest in face paint.
One post features a video of Tokosh throwing a pie at someone. Other posts mention a “clown fetish.” In a forum titled “Creepy,” he wrote, “I convince pretty girls to let me paint their faces,” along with a photo with multiple women in white face paint.
That and other similar posts remained live for years until they were taken down after the Nicholls students published their story in late March.
USA TODAY Network reporters captured screenshots before they disappeared. With dates in 2019, the posts feature a young woman wearing a Kent State T-shirt. The material would have been available to administrators at Northern Illinois before the start of the fall 2019 semester.
Joe King, a spokesman for Northern Illinois, said departments hiring new graduate students are “not required to check social media or investigate a disciplinary history.” He added some departments may reach out to the graduate students’ former advisers.
King said he could not determine if the university was aware of Tokosh’s behavior at Kent State. He said that due to FERPA, he could not share specifics about Tokosh’s time at Northern Illinois, including whether students had complained about him.
But there are signs the behavior continued.
A YouTube account under the name “Joe Tokosh” included at least two videos in 2020 of a man throwing pies at women. One of the videos features a young woman also seen in the screenshots from Tokosh’s Reddit account. 
Comments on one from October 2020 read: “You can have a video of her tied up getting pied via cash app.” That video was viewed more than 30,000 times before it was turned off in late July, around the time a USA TODAY reporter reached out to Tokosh.
A former Northern Illinois State student shared text messages exchanged with Tokosh in which he asked to paint her face on multiple occasions. USA TODAY has agreed not to name her because she is concerned Tokosh might retaliate against her.
In the text messages, Tokosh shared a photo of a young woman in white face paint – an image also posted to the Joeography Reddit account. She said she declined to do it but was aware that other Northern Illinois students had participated.
By fall 2022, when he had moved on to Nicholls, Tokosh revealed to the student that he had required students in his cultural geography class to paint their faces.  
The Northern Illinois student asked Tokosh what he did with the photos, and she said he suggested that he might spin them off into a research project someday. She asked, had anyone complained? She said Tokosh responded: Why would they?
Many students would find a reason to complain, as Nicholls State student journalist Sally-Anne Torres learned firsthand. It started in January when one of her fellow reporters picked up an odd rumor: a professor was offering extra credit for students willing to paint their faces like clowns. Initially, Torres dismissed it because it seemed too unusual and there weren’t a lot of leads to follow. 
By Feb. 7, university administrators informed Tokosh that his contract would not be renewed, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY via a records request. They gave no reason for the nonrenewal, but on Feb. 12, Tokosh emailed his students that the university was letting him go. He blamed his departure on giving too many A’s.
That seemed suspicious to Torres. 
During her reporting, she received a tip about Tokosh’s Reddit posts in which he wrote of his “clown fetish” and how he enlisted his students to participate in it.
“It wasn’t just this innocent thing that a lot of these girls thought it was,” Torres said. “As a professor or teacher, that is somebody students are supposed to trust. He used his power to ruin that trust and to do these things, and that made me angry for them.”
Torres spoke to six students who shared their experiences with Tokosh. Some, she said, were followed on Twitter by him while others opted into an extra credit assignment he offered.
The women told Torres he sometimes giggled and laughed as they painted their faces in his office.
On March 27, the Nicholls Worth published a story headlined, “Geography professor suspended immediately, students allege sexual harassment.” KNSU TV, a student broadcast network, also aired footage in which Tokosh defended the assignment on camera. That same day, Tokosh submitted his resignation.
The story’s publication prompted other students to come forward about Tokosh and their frustration with the university.
Bradley Price took an online class with Tokosh and said the professor required students to photograph themselves with their faces painted. Price said Tokosh told them the assignment was to help them understand Japanese culture, but then Tokosh offered him bonus points if he could get a female friend to paint her face.
It seemed unusual at the time, Price said, because his friend wasn’t in the class. It became more concerning to him on reading the student newspaper’s report.
“I feel frankly disgusted and disappointed that Nicholls couldn’t do a proper background check on this professor, because this is unacceptable,” Price said. 
Bella Ramos, a junior at Nicholls State who did not take any of Tokosh’s classes, told USA TODAY that someone using the handle @Joeography21 followed her on Twitter in late 2021 and started liking all her selfies.
Ramos learned that the person behind the account was likely a professor at the university. She posted about the behavior in January 2022, but nothing came of it. She also found the Joeography Reddit account. On March 27, the same day the student newspaper published its piece, Ramos posted screenshots of her discoveries on Twitter with the message, “Found a Nicholls state university professor on Reddit.”
“I wish the university had acted sooner because all this information was public on the internet,” she told USA TODAY. 
No one from the university, she said, has ever reached out.

CONCORD, N.H.−Ron DeSantis began a two-day New Hampshire swing Thursday by displaying a revamped campaign style that includes amped-up criticism of Donald Trump.
DeSantis focused on Trump's comments Wednesday criticizing the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netahnyahu and his government over the war with Hamas, and describing Hezbollah militants as "very smart."
"Now is not the time to be attacking our ally," DeSantis told supporters at the New Hampshire State House.
Several Republicans noted that, after the 2020 election, Trump attacked Netanyahu for hailing Biden as the president-elect.
"It’s clear he’s angry at Netanyahu for recognizing Trump lost in 2020," said a statement from Never Back Down, a pro-DeSantis political action committee. "Trump puts himself first."
What did Trump say about Netanyahu?Trump blames Netanyahu for Hamas attacks, calls Hezbollah leaders 'very smart'
DeSantis spoke after formally filing for January’s New Hampshire primary, a contest he declared “wide open” despite Trump’s huge lead in polls.
“If you want to change from Trump, I think I’m the best leader,” DeSantis said, adding that he gives Republicans “the best chance to be able to do well” in a general election.
DeSantis, who has seen his support erode after months of attacks from Trump, has gradually escalated counter-criticism of the former president throughout the campaign. He has been more pointed in recent days, part of a strategy adjustment that includes more interviews with mainstream media outlets.
The Florida governor plans to spend Thursday touring the northern part of the state along with members of his political action committee, Never Back Down.
He is scheduled to participate Friday in traditional events, including a "Politics and Eggs" breakfast hosted by the New Hampshire Institute of Politics.
DeSantis and other Republican candidates are scheduled to address the state Republican Party's "First in the Nation Leadership Summit" in Nashua, N.H. this weekend.
The U.S. government announced it will provide charter flights for American citizens and their immediate families looking to leave Israel.
The flights, which are set to begin on Friday, will operate to locations in Europe where there is more commercial capacity across the Atlantic. U.S. citizens in Israel in need of assistance should complete the crisis intake form at travel.state.gov. 
“We are all acutely aware of limited availability right now on commercial flights out of Israel and the demand signal of U.S. citizens who may want to depart. The president has asked his team to ensure we are assisting U.S. citizens who do want to leave Israel in providing them with a safe means of doing that,” John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council said during a White House press briefing Thursday. “We’re also exploring other options to expand the capacity of doing this including exploring whether it’s possible to help Americans leave by land and by sea.” 
Kirby said that the State Department is still finalizing details of the plan and did not make more specifics available.

Hi there OnPolitics readers! In less than a year, the 118th Congress has already made history.  
There were significant firsts, such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries becoming the first Black lawmaker to lead a party in Congress, USA TODAY’s Savannah Kuchar reports.
But the upper and lower chambers have also prompted more offbeat headlines, from marathon votes for House speaker to bribery and fraud charges. Here’s a recap of history-making moments:  
Kevin McCarthy's marathon election: A hold-out faction among House Republicans stalled the vote for House speaker for four days − and 15 rounds of voting − in January.
George Santos indicted on fraud charges: The New York Republican faces a 23-count indictment accusing him of stealing campaign donor identities and using their credit cards to for unauthorized charges. 
Who wore it best? A minor rule change that allowed for casual dress in the Senate sparked an immediate backlash. Senators went on to pass a resolution codifying a formal dress code for lawmakers.  
Gold bars and bribes? Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last month for a second time, after he and his wife allegedly accepted bribes in the form of cash, a car and gold bars.  He was indicted again today.

An Oct. 4 Facebook post (direct link, archive link) claims the sons of two well-known politicians are in legal trouble.
“Tagg Romney & Paul Pelosi, Jr. Children of Mitt Romney and Nancy Pelosi are now under criminal investigation for business dealing in Ukraine’s Bursima Energy (sic),” reads the post.  It was later updated to attribute the information to Newsmax.
The post was shared more than 250 times in two days. Another version of the post was shared more than 13,000 times on X, formerly Twitter.

This is wrong on multiple fronts. There is no evidence that Tagg Romney or Paul Pelosi Jr. are connected to the Ukrainian energy company Burisma at all. And, accordingly, there is no evidence of any criminal investigation along those lines.
President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden sat on the board of Burisma from 2014 to 2019. Some Republicans have claimed then-Vice President Joe Biden wrongfully used his power to force the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the company, but a 2020 Senate investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the president.
There is no evidence that the children of Utah Sen. Mitt Romney or former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi were involved with the company. And there's no evidence of any investigation involving the two.
The Department of Justice has made no announcement of any such investigation, and no credible news outlets have reported on a probe involving Tagg Romney and Paul Pelosi Jr.
There is also no evidence that Newsmax reported on the supposed probe into the two men. Newsmax did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Facebook post is a new variation of a long-running claim of ties between Ukraine and the sons of various politicians.
USA TODAY in 2021 debunked the similar claim that Tagg Romney and Paul Pelosi Jr., as well as the sons of President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State John Kerry, were all on the board of directors for energy companies doing business in Ukraine. Only Hunter Biden has worked for a Ukranian company.
Fact check: Mitt Romney announced he won't seek reelection in 2024, but he's not resigning
Former President Donald Trump tried to connect Mitt Romney to Burisma in 2020 after the senator voted to impeach Trump related to efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rivals in exchange for military aid, as reported by POLITICO. The allegation was made on the grounds that an advisor from Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign was on the company’s board of directors.
There is no evidence that Tagg Romney or Paul Pelosi, Jr. have worked for Ukrainian companies.
Drew Hammill, Nancy Pelosi's former deputy chief of staff, told USA TODAY in 2020 that claims of a relationship between Paul Pelosi, Jr. and Burisma Holdings were "completely false." USA TODAY reached out to the Department of Justice and the offices of Mitt Romney and Nancy Pelosi for comment but did not receive a response.
Paul Pelosi, Jr., Nancy's Pelosi's son, has been involved with various companies throughout his business career, as mentioned in a 2012 Securities and Exchange Commission filing. He at one point was a board member for Viscoil Holdings LLC, an energy company based in California that later reorganized under a new name. In 2021, Paul Pelosi Jr. became president of EVSK Corp., a Canada-based company focused on electric vehicle battery recycling.
Tagg Romney, Mitt Romney's eldest son, co-founded the private equity investment firm Solamere Capital in 2008. The company is based in Boston and also has an office in New York.
Outlets including Reuters and PolitiFact also debunked claims of Nancy Pelosi and Mitt Romney’s supposed connections to Ukrainian energy companies.

The attacks came by land, sea, air – and online. 
Terror propaganda − violent videos and graphic images of kidnappings and murders of civilians and soldiers that flooded social media from the deadly cross-border incursion into Israel − was a key element in Hamas’ military campaign, said Graham Brookie, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.
Hamas streamed from the war zone “in closer to real-time than in past conflicts,” indicating that the online strategy “was an essential part of the overall planning for their attack on Israel” to take advantage of how hyperconnected Israel is with its widespread use of smartphones and social media, Brookie said.
Veterans of conflict zones on Brookie’s team tracking Hamas' digital footprint were struck by the ferocity and volume of the footage, the likes of which he said it had never seen, he said.
The effects could become more grave if Hamas makes good on a threat to broadcast executions of hostages, Brookie said. Some Hamas officials have since walked back the threat.
Spreading propaganda on social media networks – especially those with more lax moderation systems – is a low-cost and highly effective tactic that is increasingly being deployed by terrorist groups, said Colin P. Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group, a global intelligence and security consultancy.
The videos and images from the deadly attacks posted by Hamas-affiliated accounts were shared by Hamas allies and unwitting participants around the globe, Clarke said.
The tactic is pulled from the playbooks of the Islamic State and al-Qaida, which experts said pioneered the viral form of psychological warfare by livestreaming beheadings and other graphic footage.
“This is the nature of asymmetric warfare – you've got to utilize tools that are going to make you seem bigger and more powerful than you are,” Clarke said. “For Hamas, it costs them nothing to videotape something and send it out there, and now everyone thinks that they're creeping around every corner.”
Hamas fired off posts from official accounts on the encrypted messaging and social media app Telegram that ricocheted to X, formerly Twitter, and beyond. 
Telegram – which allows messaging between users but also has a “Channel” function that works similarly to X – has a long history of being used by terrorists, among them the Islamic State, or ISIS. The platform, often labeled by extremism experts as “Terrorgram,” is increasingly embraced by domestic extremists in the U.S. in recent years because of its almost nonexistent moderation. 
“As soon as something posts on Telegram, we see this crossflow of content to mainstream platforms, either intentionally or just through the oxygen of amplification,” Brookie said.
X, which gutted its trust and safety teams under new owner Elon Musk, was unprepared for the wave of terror propaganda that then spread to other social media platforms and messaging apps like WhatsApp.
This week, X said it was removing newly created Hamas-affiliated accounts and coordinating with industry peers “to try and prevent terrorist content from being distributed online.” It also recommended that people adjust their sensitive media settings if they don’t want to see disturbing content. 
The U.K. summoned social media executives Wednesday to demand platforms remove violent content of the Hamas attacks on Israel.
Telegram and X did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
If social media sites continue to erode guardrails and safeguards, Clarke warned, what is happening today will get worse.
“This is just the facet of what’s called ‘fourth generation warfare,’ or ‘modern warfare’ in this era,” he said. “So, whatever the next conflict is, it doesn't really matter, you're going to see this on steroids.”   
Once propaganda and disinformation reaches X, the platform is allowing it to be shared and even monetized, a report from the Tech Transparency Project found.
The report, an advance copy of which was provided exclusively to USA TODAY, found several premium subscriber accounts – which pay a fee of $8 a month to the platform – sharing Hamas propaganda including violent and graphic images of the attacks on Israel.
According to the report, some video content appears to violate X’s “violent and hateful entities policy,” which prohibits promotion of terrorist organizations and their propaganda. It also appears to violate an X policy stating that the platform will remove accounts sharing content produced by terrorists, the report states.
Despite X’s announcement that it was working to remove Hamas-affiliated accounts, TTP researchers "found no evidence that X had restricted the accounts sharing the Hamas attack videos,” the report says. It also notes that in some cases, X ran advertisements in the comments under the video posts.
The TTP report found several instances of “verified” X users, some with more than 500,000 followers, spreading uncensored Hamas propaganda videos. 
One clip posted to X shows bodycam footage of Hamas militants going room-to-room in an Israeli military base firing automatic weapons. Bloodied bodies lie on the ground in the video, which has been watched more than 60,000 times.   
“It's been nearly 10 years since the Islamic State made heavy use of social media to amplify its propaganda and recruitment efforts. Although some platforms have improved at reducing the spread of Islamic State content, today we see Hamas deploying very similar tactics on X,” TTP director Katie A Paul told USA TODAY. “The company has monetized the spread of Hamas propaganda despite its clear violations of X policy. X needs to effectively enforce the rules it has on the books as the conflict continues.”  
Brookie says social media platforms are being forced to grapple with a multi-front crisis to shield users from terror propaganda, misleading information, hate speech and violent and graphic images and footage.
“The amount of content is going to be more than any team, whether it’s at a platform or a research team like mine, or a journalism outlet or organization could possibly sift through,” he said. “That changes the frame from who’s doing well to who’s doing the least bad in a hard situation.” 
The major platforms are working with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) which was founded by Facebook, Microsoft, X and YouTube in 2017 to prevent terrorists and violent extremists from exploiting digital platforms. 
“In this rapidly evolving situation, we continue to work with our members to identify and follow trends in content and activity online related to terrorist and violent extremist actors involved in the offline violence,” GIFCT said in a statement. “This includes the possibility that a range of terrorist and violent extremist networks and groups may seek to exploit the conflict for their own purposes, as we have seen in past events.”
Facebook, YouTube and TikTok say they have poured resources into moderating content from the Israel-Hamas war. 
“After the terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel on Saturday, we quickly established a special operations center staffed with experts, including fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers, to closely monitor and respond to this rapidly evolving situation,” Meta said in a statement.
The major platforms prohibit content produced by terrorist organizations including Hamas as well as footage showing hostages. 
Apple’s fall device drop gets all the love, but Google wants you to remember it’s here, too – with lots of shiny new tech and some seriously impressive artificial intelligence upgrades coming soon to a phone near you.
Let’s break down everything Google just announced and see how the Pixel 8 stacks up against the new iPhone 15.
I write about the latest tech gear, security alerts and digital life hacks in my daily emails.Join 600K+ who get the Current each day. It’s free!
Batting 1,000
That’s how much the Google Pixel 8 Pro costs (OK, it’s $999) – up $100 from the top-tier 7 model. For a grand, it includes Google’s zippy Tensor G3 chip and a camera good enough to rival the iPhone 15. Neat feature: Zoom Enhance lets you go in and add details after you’ve taken the shot and want to zoom in on a pic.
The other random but excellent addition is a temperature sensor that can accurately measure how hot or cold a surface, object and even your forehead is.
It comes in black, porcelain and light blue – shipping is expected on Thursday.
Speaking of Google … 20 Google Search tricks, hidden utilities, games and freebies
What about the non-Pro?
The Pixel 8 is going up $100, too. It’s faster and slightly smaller than the 7 – and gets access to Google’s sweet new AI photo editing tools (along with the 8 Pro).
◾ Magic Editor uses AI to change the scenery in a photo, remove distracting elements and even move people around.
◾ Best Take is a group-shot game changer. The idea is you take several pictures, and then you can choose the best face for each subject and merge them into one final image. Finally, everyone looks good!
◾ Audio Magic Eraser tones down distracting sounds in audio tracks that are ruining your video.
The 8 is $699, or $799 if you’re buying from Verizon. It comes in rose, black and hazel and is expected to ship on Thursday too.
Updates till 2030
Hey, at least if you spend all the money, you know your phone will work for many years. Google says the 8 and 8 Pro get seven years of “OS, security, and Feature Drop updates” for both phones.

How do they stack up against the new iPhones?
For most people, it comes down to what ecosystem you prefer. If you’ve been using one or the other for years, you know exactly how they work and are comfortable with the OS.
Perhaps you’re not so brand loyal. Let’s compare some specs, shall we? We’ll stick with the base models.
iPhone 15 vs. Pixel 8
◾ Cost: $799 to $1,099 (iPhone); $699 to $749 (Pixel)
I’ll let you draw your own conclusions, but on specs alone, the Pixel models are totally solid for the price. (And yes, I say that as an iPhone devotee.)
Beyond the phones, here’s what else Google is working on.
More battery life, better sensors
The Pixel Watch 2 looks like the original, but the insides got a significant upgrade. The improved Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 processor means up to 24 hours of battery life, even with the always-on display enabled.
It’s outfitted with new skin temperature and electrodermal activity sensors to tell how stressed you are, along with additional heart rate sensors for more accurate readings and automatic workout tracking.
You’re looking at $349.99 for the GPS version or $399.99 for LTE. Pick from silver and blue, silver and white, gold and hazel, or all-black.
Can you hear me, Buds?
The Pixel Buds are Google’s answer to the AirPods. The upgraded Buds Pro get light blue and porcelain options to match the new phones, along with audio upgrades for “fuller and clearer” sound. They’re $199.99.
Assistant gets smarter
It wouldn’t be 2023 if there weren’t some AI talk. Google Assistant is getting a Bard AI upgrade “in the coming months.” It’ll connect with your Google apps – like Gmail, Drive and Calendar – to plan trips, caption pictures, make lists and find that dinner reservation you forgot about.

I really like the new Apple Watch Series 9. It reminds me a lot of my Apple Watch Series 8.
I’ve been evaluating the latest smartwatches from Apple, Samsung and Google. And at first blush, separating this year’s models from their predecessors seems a little like deciphering whether that SUV in the parking lot is a 2019 or 2020 Chevy Tahoe.
That’s good news if you splurged for a new smartwatch last fall, because your investment is anything but obsolete. By the same token, there’s more to this year’s models than powder-coated wheel finishes and trim decals. So if you’re considering an upgrade after a few years – or even switching teams – there’s plenty to consider.
Apple and Samsung have turned it up to … 2,000. That’s 2,000 nits, a measure of brightness, Which is, like, really bright.
Both the new Apple Watch Series 9 (starting at $399 for 41mm, $529 as tested, 45mm aluminum with LTE) and the Samsung Watch 6 Classic (starting at $369.99 for 43mm, $449.99 as tested, 47mm stainless steel with LTE) are incredibly easy to read – even here, in the extreme desert sun. For some reason, I found the Series 9’s 2,000-nit display to be somewhat brighter and crisper than the Watch 6 Classic’s 2,000-nit display.
The Google Pixel Watch 2 (starting at $349.99, $399.99 as tested with LTE) checks in at 1,000 nits, the same as the inaugural Pixel Watch as well as last year’s offerings from Samsung and Apple. Although it pales in comparison to the 2,000-nit displays, I can still read the 1,000-nit screens outside. And if you’re more likely to read a message in Scarsdale than Scottsdale, then the new 2,000-nit options may not have the same appeal.
Apple Watch Series 9 (iOS)
Apple also upgraded the Watch’s internal processors, which the company credits for a few new features, like “Double Tap.” The Double Tap hand gesture – the Watch detects when you quickly press your thumb and middle fingers together – can help control the device when you can’t reach over with your other hand to answer a call or scan alerts. In my beta-testing of the feature, it worked a lot like “Assistive Touch,” which Apple introduced two years ago, only a bit snappier.
The added horsepower also gives Siri offline capabilities that improve the voice assistant’s speed and accuracy.
iOS updates again?:Apple is urging everyone to update iPhone and iPad iOS (again). Why you should do it now.
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (Android)
A lot of what’s new-and-improved with Samsung’s flagship smartwatch actually comes from Google’s Wear OS, which Samsung recommitted to a couple years ago. The Watch 6 Classic is livelier and more responsive than the Watch 5 Pro, with better graphics for alerts and more engaging apps. And sleep tracking seems to be more reliable, accurate and – as a consequence – relevant.
Although the processor and sensors are largely identical, the Watch 6 Classic is easier to visually identify because Samsung brought back a popular engagement tool: the rotating bezel.
Google Pixel Watch 2 (Android)
The Google offering, available Thursday, endured the most substantial changes year over year, by far. But it is just the second iteration of a formidable undertaking to meld the popular fitness platform from Fitbit, which Google bought four years ago, with the premium Wear OS smartwatch ecosystem. It’s already spawned a worthy contender. But there’s still a lot to do.
The Pixel Watch 2 boasts a new, more accurate heartrate sensor that is much better at tracking vigorous activity. There’s now a temperature sensor as well as cEDA for stress monitoring. It has an upgraded processor and more durable glass. It also runs the new Wear OS 4, just like Samsung’s Watch 6 series.
The Fitbit/Wear mix-and-match journey is most evident when the two platforms have a different approach to the same task. For example, Fitbit’s all-in-one app is at odds with how Wear OS – and other vendors as well, for that matter – on-board and configure hardware. That has made it challenging for Fitbit to add Google features to its devices, just as it has been for Google to add Fitbit’s app to its devices.
It is also making it challenging to swap back and forth between the Pixel Watch 2 and the original Watch or – more difficult – traditional Fitbit devices. I’m juggling three wearables right now – the new Fitbit Charge 6 as well as the two Pixel Watches – and it can be downright aggravating. Conversely, that process is automatic and hassle-free for those swapping Apple or Samsung devices. Samsung’s relative ease at handling the task is particularly illustrative, given that Google’s own Wear OS is managing the handoff.
Through it all, the 41mm Pixel Watch 2 is an attractive, well-built watch with a great health and fitness pedigree. I wish Google would offer two sizes, as Apple and Samsung do. I prefer the beefier, 45mm-47mm options. Hopefully Google will get around to that in future revisions.
I also wish Google would offer better battery life. But I’m not holding my breath.
Online hate surge:Online hate surges after Hamas attacks Israel. Why everyone is blaming social media.
Unfortunately, Big Tech seems content to offer mediocre battery life for their pricey, high-powered smartwatches. Apple has never promised more than a waking day between charges on full power.
That obviously hasn’t hurt Apple – and Samsung has taken a cue. The Watch 6 Classic simply matches Apple battery life, rather than beating it with 36- to 48-hour battery life, as in previous generations.
Most disappointing is Google, which is foregoing Fitbit’s multiday battery legacy by providing up to just 24 hours of power in the Pixel Watch 2.
Multiday battery life would be a major upgrade. It’s not only more convenient. It also makes smartwatches more engaging. For one thing, it dramatically boosts the likelihood of tracking sleep, one of the most crucial health indicators.
Battery life aside, these are three very good watches to choose from. So if you’re kicking the tires on a new model, don’t let the recycled styling dissuade you. The Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch series are both locked in after years of refinement. And while it’s comparatively early on for the Pixel Watch series, Google has done a good job so far combining two very established platforms.

The concept that we are all computer-generated characters occupying a world as real as the ones gamers explore on their PlayStation consoles isn't exactly a new one.
As far back as 1999, Morpheus was entering "The Matrix" to break Neo and a few other chosen few out of a simulated reality created by advanced machines in order to use humans as an energy source. But as the idea permeates not just the realm of science fiction and popular culture, but academia as well, every now and then a philosopher or physicist has something new to say about it.
That's what happened this week when a physicist at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom proposed that a new law of physics could support the theory that what we see as our reality is in fact a complex virtual simulation running on a cosmic computer. The theory stems from previous research that Dr. Melvin Vopson has conducted looking into whether information has mass.
"Any normal person will think, could it be that maybe we already are in some kind of digital virtual reality world?" Vopson said in a March video posted on the university's YouTube channel.
"It's not farfetched to assume that an advanced civilization or maybe ourselves in the future, we reach the technological level where we can simulate our world or the whole universe and it's indistinguishable from the reality."

The idea that the cosmos runs on quantum codes has existed for years, becoming popularized in academia in 2003 when philosopher Nick Bostrom of the University of Oxford wrote an influential paper about the simulation argument.
In principle, anything can be simulated with a computer with sufficient power. Bostrom argued that for advanced civilizations, such an intricate simulation would be rather easy for those wanting to explore their histories or entertain their children.
The theory is popular among many notable figures, including Elon Musk. The Tesla founder and CEO weighed in at a 2016 conference, stating that in his opinion, the odds that we're living in what he called "base reality" — in other words, the real universe as opposed to a simulated one — are “one in billions.”
So are we not unlike the characters we oversee in the Sims, confined to a superficial, restricted sandbox while more advanced beings are spectators to our existence?
It's hard to say, as the theory is as hard to disprove as it it to prove. In fact, 2020 research authored by David Kipping, an astronomer at Columbia University, found that the odds of us living in a base reality are pretty much 50-50, with the odds only slightly in favor of our universe not being simulated.

Vopson's latest research stems from the abstract concept that information is the fundamental building block of the universe and has both energy and physical mass.
"My questions was, where is that information going when the bit is at equilibrium and is stored information?" he said in the Youtube video. "Energy can't exist on its own, it needs to be in some form."
It's the belief of Vopson and others working in the field of science known as information physics that our physical reality could be made up of bits of information, which aren't unlike the cells of living organisms that are coded with DNA containing valuable information about themselves.
After studying digital data storage and an RNA genome, Vopson discovered in 2022 that information systems don't appear to conform to the second law of thermodynamics. That law essentially dictates that any naturally occurring process will result in a loss of energy and increase in a system's measure of disorder, or entropy (think of an ice cube that gradually melts when placed in a cup of water at room temperature.)
In fact, Vopson discovered that the entropy in information systems actually decreases, leading him to establish what he calls the second law of information dynamics.
Vopson recently set out to apply the discovery to genetics, cosmology, atomic physics, symmetry and yes, even the simulation hypothesis. Published last week in AIP Advances, Vopson's paper provides an explanation for how the removal of excess information in our universe resembles the process of a computer deleting or compressing unneeded code to save storage space and conserve power.
In short, it's a process he said could support the idea that we may be living in a Matrix-style artificial reality akin to a computer simulation, where we and anything else we perceive is nothing more than a virtual facsimile.
"It doesn't prove entirely that," Vopson said in the video. "It underpins the concept through empirical evidence, but it doesn't mean necessarily that is totally the consensus that is happening; it is one possibility."

The movie "Snakes on a Plane" dramatized perhaps the worst things to encounter on a flight, but imagine being stuck on a real-world plane with a swarm of mosquitos.
It happened to a local flight in Mexico, which was delayed for more than two hours from its scheduled departure time of 4:30 p.m., due to a mosquito infestation, local media reported. Cabin crew and ground staff tried to get the situation under control by spraying mosquito and insect repellent in the cabins. It eventually took off at 6:59 p.m., according to the flight's history.
The flight, VOI221 operated by Volaris Airlines, was traveling within Mexico from Guadalajara to Mexico City on Friday, October 6, according to Storyful.

Video footage from the incident, recorded by a passenger, shows the airplane's cabin filled with fumes as flight attendants spray insect repellent to counteract the swarm of mosquitoes buzzing around the cabin. The flight appeared to be ready for takeoff, with all passengers seated. Some of them could be heard screaming in the video, while others swatted the insects away.
As the airlines staff sprayed the mosquito repellent, the insects became more agitated reported the local media outlet El Sol de León.
They did not settle down until all the lights were turned off, a passenger told Storyful.
This is not the first time that a swarm of mosquitos attacked a flight taking off from the Guadalajara International Airport. A similar incident took place in 2019. El Sol de León said that the area in which the airport is located is close to contaminated water bodies and vegetation, both of which are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Favorable weather conditions also contribute to increasing mosquito populations.
Airport authorities have recognized this as a problem, reported El Sol de León, and have taken steps such as draining water, pruning grass and spraying insecticides to curb the problem.
Volaris Airlines did not immediately respond to USA TODAY'S request for a comment.

2023 was the year of all things pink, thanks to Greta Gerwig's "Barbie", so it comes as no surprise that a community in Utah made "Barbie" the theme of this year's Halloween, bringing the pink paradise to life in South Jordan, a city approximately 20 miles south of Salt Lake City.
"One of my neighbors bought us all tickets for "Barbie" and we went to see the movie together. And as we were leaving, we were like, 'Oh my gosh, you guys. Barbie is gonna be the Halloween theme this year'," Liz Gallegos, one of the people behind the idea and a resident of Daybreak told USA TODAY.
Building upon her idea, Gallegos' neighbor's daughter Miley suggested they turn their neighborhood into "Barbieland," an idea that everyone loved.
Come September, the residents got to work, dressing up their houses in different themes, including the Mojo Dojo Casa house, Pool Party Barbie and Dream House Barbie.
Gallegos said around seven members of the community were already onboard because they saw the movie together and were in on the plan from the beginning. They invited other neighbors to participate as well, ultimately ending up with 18 houses dressed up in the Barbieland theme.
They left no stone unturned, paying attention to even the minutest of details and adding elements from Barbieland including a pool slide, horses, and neon signs that read, “You guys ever think about dying?” and “RIP the patriarchy” tombstones.
The house concepts include:
Thanks 'Barbie'!Blockbuster film joins 'Oppenheimer' in boosting summer box office sales
Photos:Barbie's Malibu dream house is back on Airbnb, but this time Ken is hosting for free
Gallegos said that her neighborhood is very special and unique in the sense that their community is tight knit, especially because their houses face each other instead of the street.
"What's really special and unique is that most people in Daybreak care a lot about Halloween. We have historically gone pretty big for Halloween. We've had a 'Harry Potter' house, a 'Stranger Things' house, an 'Encanto' house. So, we've always kind of gone above and beyond for Halloween."
Kenzie Bates, an event organizer based in Lehi, Utah who has previously designed Harry Potter and Encanto-themed houses told USA TODAY that Gallegos reached out to her with the idea of making people experience Barbieland, even if it was only for a day.
Kenzie, worked with the residents of Daybreak, as the creative director of the setup, sourcing decorations and props for them including a life-size horse, signs for the houses and other custom-built items.
While many elements from Barbieland were incorporated into the setup, some residents also wanted to keep the spirit of Halloween alive, so they included elements such as gravestones and skeletons. In fact, there is a gravestone dedicated to Ruth Handler, the founder of Mattel, the company that produces Barbie dolls.
"Some people were very much into Halloween, and they didn't want to lose sight of it, so they went with themes like haunted Barbie and graveyard Barbie," Kenzie said.
Barbieland is attracting thousands of people, both Gallegos and Bates said, adding that the little island is so busy during the month of October that it's "very hard" to get on and off the bridge that connects their neighborhood to South Jordan. Daybreak is a housing community in South Jordan, with one part of it situated on an island and surrounded by a moat.
"I mean, we knew that people in Daybreak would care because they love Halloween," said Gallegos. "But none of us had any idea that anyone outside of our little neighborhood would care at all."
She said that she posted a few videos on TikTok on the suggestion of her friends, and they soon went viral, with people sending in requests to come and see the setup. At least two of the videos hit more than 2 million views on TikTok.
"I feel like it's a landmark or something," said Gallegos. "We have people at our house starting at like 8 a.m. even though we usually turn on lights and music around 5:30 p.m. in the evening. During the day we'll just have moms or kids or strollers coming by, but by the late afternoon and early evening, it really starts picking up and between like 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., it's just a constant stream of people like every single night, no matter what night of the week it is."
Gallegos said that the local police force was also taken aback by the number of people and traffic jams.
However, Gallegos and her neighbors do not mind the attention or influx of people.
"It honestly makes me so happy because there's a lot of really sad stuff in the world right now," Gallegos shared. "It's hard to keep your chin up every day. So, it's nice, happy, small little things that are making people happy."

A fishing trip became a life-changing event for Phil Garner when he came across an orphaned duck.
Phil was at a fishing pond with his son when a bedraggled duckling latched onto them. With no sign of the duck’s family, Garner was encouraged by the pond owner to take the bird home as otherwise it would most likely have died.
Back at his house in Allerton Bywater, near Leeds, England, Phil and his wife, Julia, nursed the duck back to health and named her Freda.
After 18 months of living with them, Freda disappeared. But a few months later, she returned with a big surprise for her owners.
Watch the video below to see what Freda brought back when she returned to her home

Donald Trump lashed out at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling a crowd of Florida supporters that the countries' intelligence failed, and its enemies were ''very smart."
"I'll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down," Trump told a group of supporters Wednesday in West Palm Beach, Fla. "That was a very terrible thing."
Trump discussed the operation that killed Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani in early 2020. The former president said Israel now has to strengthen itself as it fights Hamas and other militant groups, including perhaps Iran.
Supporters of Israel said on social media said that the Soleimani operation was aided by Israeli intelligence, while others criticized Trump for criticizing Israel's government in the midst of a crisis.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running against Trump for the Republican nomination, zeroed in on Trump's description of Hezbollah leaders as "very smart."
Noting that at least 1,200 Israelis and 22 Americans have been killed in recent days, DeSantis said on the X website that "it is absurd that anyone, much less someone running for President, would choose now to attack our friend and ally, Israel, much less praise Hezbollah terrorists as 'very smart.' As President, I will stand with Israel and treat terrorists like the scum that they are."
During what was otherwise a campaign speech, Trump claimed that an unnamed U.S. official described Israel as being vulnerable from the north, and that kind of information would be helpful to adversaries.
"You know, Hezbollah is very smart - they're all very smart," Trump said at one point.
Trump also criticized Netanyahu in an interview on Fox News Radio, saying Israel was ill-prepared for the Hamas attack earlier this month.
"He has been hurt very badly because of what’s happened here," Trump told Brian Kilmeade of Fox News Radio. "He was not prepared. He was not prepared, and Israel was not prepared."
Trump even linked the Israel attack to his false claims of a "rigged" U.S. election in 2020, and said the attack on Israel would not have happened if he was president.
Several Republicans noted that, after the 2020 election, Trump attacked Netanyahu for hailing Biden as the president-elect.
"It’s clear he’s angry at Netanyahu for recognizing Trump lost in 2020," said a statement from Never Back Down, a pro-DeSantis political action committee. " Trump puts himself first."
On the X social media site, the organization Republicans against Trump said: "As President Biden and the entire world stand in solidarity with Israel after the worst terrorist attack in Israel’s history, Donald Trump has decided to attack Israel and its military. Unfit for office."
Democrats denounced Trump’s comments.
White House spokesman Andrew Bates said that while “we don’t comment” on the 2024 races, “statements like this are dangerous and unhinged.”
Bates added: “It’s completely lost on us why any American would ever praise an Iran-backed terrorist organization as ‘’smart.’ Or have any objection to the United States warning terrorists not to attack Israel. Especially now as Israel is fighting back against one of the worst acts of mass murder in the country’s history. This is a time for all of us to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel against ‘unadulterated evil.’ That’s what the President is doing as commander in chief.”
Trump's comments came during a rambling 100-minute speech in which he didn't say anything about his involvement in the snagged House Speaker's race, but instead predicted he would succeed in next year's presidential election.
"Everyone knows what the result is going to be," the former president told supporters gathered in West Palm Beach, Fla.
Last week, Trump injected himself into the speaker's race by endorsing Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. He also said he would travel to Washington, D.C., to meet with House Republicans about replacing ousted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.
Trump did not go to Washington and Jordan fell short in balloting among House Republicans who favored House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.
It is not yet Scalise's job. A number of House Republicans said they would continue to support Jordan, denying Scalise a necessary majority in a full House vote that includes Democrats.
Trump did not discuss any of this during his campaign speech. He mentioned Jordan's name only in connection with his work in Congress.
He also praised Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., the most outspoken member of the eight House Republicans who triggered McCarthy's removal as speaker.
For the most part, Trump focused on his own 2024 presidential campaign before a group called Club 47 USA. If Trump wins next year, he would be the 47th president, only the second to serve non-consecutive terms.
The standard campaign speech featured all-out attacks on President Joe Biden, with an emphasis to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. He also hit Biden over the economy, his son Hunter Biden, and border security.
Trump, as is custom, also bragged about poll numbers that show him way ahead of his Republican rivals for the 2024 presidential nomination. He mocked his opponents for debating without him, and said Republican voters are not paying attention to them.
"Everyone knows what the result is going to be," Trump said.
He also complained about his legal issues. He faces four criminal trials and three civil lawsuits The criminal cases include hush money, the handling of classified information, and efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden.
On the Week 6 schedule, 40% of the games tilt heavily toward the favorite before the first kickoff of the week tonight between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs.
The Chiefs-Broncos match up is emblematic of much of the week ahead. The Chiefs are favored by 10.5 points over the one-win Broncos. There haven't been this many lopsided games from Vegas's vantage point since the last week of the 2022-23 season when most teams' postseason fates had been set.
Five of touchdown-or-more favorites are among the top six of USA TODAY's Week 6 power rankings where all stand least a dozen rungs above their opponents.
Since last season, most weeks included four games with lopsided odds. The favored team in those games have covered the oddsmakers point spread about half the time, 47% to exact, based on the final spreads collected by Pro Football Reference.
Assuming Thursday night's Prime Video game at 8:15 p.m. ET goes as expected, gamblers might be better off taking the over on the number of times Taylor Swift is mentioned. Here are some of Week 6's other match ups:
A touchdown and at least a field goal separate the teams in three match ups this week. Two games are in prime time while winless Carolina Panthers and the 4-1 Miami Dolphins are hidden among the games in 1 p.m. ET time slot.
29. New York Giants at 5. Buffalo Bills: The 1-4 Giants are giving up more than 30 points a game while scoring just over 12. That's practically a mirror image of the 3-2 Bills who have scored 79 more points than their opponents. The Bills are also looking to bounce back from an upset loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in London.
32. Carolina Panthers at 2. Miami Dolphins: The Panthers have been outscored by 10 or more points in all but one of their games this season. That doesn't bode well against Miami's high-speed offense that flirted a few week's ago with an NFL record number of points in a game.
Both 4:25 p.m. ET games of the week on FOX also have one-touchdown spreads, while the struggling New England Patriots travel to Las Vegas to play the 2-3 Raiders who defeated the Green Bay Packers on Monday night.
2. Philadelphia Eagles vs. 21. New York Jets: This isn't the match up NFL schedule makers expected before Aaron Rodgers went down with Achilles tendon tear in Week 1. Even with Rodgers, this would have been a major test against the undefeated Eagles who haven't lost to the Jets in their 12 previous meetings.
1. San Francisco 49ers vs. 13. Cleveland Browns: The 49ers, the NFL's other undefeated team, have outscored their opponents by about 20 points per game. Cleveland comes off their bye week at .500, but will two weeks of preparation even be enough to stop this 49ers team's roll? This year, they've held teams to second fewest points – the Browns are No. 1 – and scored the second most points only to Miami, of course.
On the other end of the spectrum this weekend, a trio of 1 p.m. games boast first-place implications as the NFL completes the first third of the season.
17. Indianapolis Colts vs. 7. Jacksonville Jaguars: There's nothing like a trip to London to turn your season around – at least for the Jaguars. This Sunday they're in a battle for first place in the AFC South with the Colts who lost rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson to a shoulder injury. Gardner Minshew will take the reigns for the next four weeks.
3. Detroit Lions vs. 14 Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Both teams could solidify their holds on first place in their respective conferences with wins. Tampa Bay is another team returning from their bye week to face a top five team in USA TODAY's power rankings.
12. Seattle Seahawks vs. 23. Cincinnati Bengals: One-loss Seattle also comes back from its bye and finds itself as an underdog to the resurgent (at least for a week) Bengals. A win could get Cincinnati fully back into the mix within the AFC North.

People on Social Security will receive a much smaller bump of 3.2% in their benefits checks next year, as the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, after government data on Thursday showed inflation steadied in September from the prior month.
Annual inflation was 3.7% in September, matching August’s increase but off a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Without the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called “core” inflation rate fell to 4.1% from August’s 4.3%. 
Although inflation remains about double the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, it remains mostly lower, which means Social Security recipients will see a lower COLA.
The 3.2% increase in 2024 is about one-third of the four-decade-high 8.7% COLA in 2023. And while the hike in benefits remains higher than the 2.6% average over the past 20 years, older adults are pessimistic about their finances and the growing possibility of Social Security benefit cuts, according to the latest retirement survey of 2,258 people by The Senior Citizens League, a nonprofit seniors group. 
Protect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023
“Worry that retirement income won’t be enough to cover the cost of essentials in the coming months is a top concern of 56% of survey respondents,” said Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst at The Senior Citizens League, in a release. “Social Security benefit cuts are an even bigger concern.” 
Various reasons the COLA is falling short include: 
◾ Inflation: 68% of older adults say their household expenses remain at least 10% higher than one year ago, although the overall inflation rate has slowed, according to the League’s survey. They said this situation has persisted over the last year. 
◾ Benefit cuts: Nearly 6 out of 10 respondents rank this as their top worry. “Significant numbers of lower-income older households have lost access to some safety net programs over the past 12 months,” Johnson said.  
Some faced a double whammy. The 5.9% and 8.7% COLAs in 2022 and 2023, respectively, boosted incomes just enough to make some ineligible for low-income assistance programs such as supplemental nutrition assistance program, or SNAP (food stamps) and rental assistance, and federal emergency COVID-19 assistance for SNAP and Medicaid ended earlier this year. 
◾ Taxes: Because Social Security recipients received the highest COLA in 40 years in 2023, Johnson expects more beneficiaries to owe federal income taxes on their Social Security benefits for the first time in the upcoming 2024 tax season.  
Up to 85% of Social Security benefits can be counted as taxable income when income exceeds certain thresholds. Unlike other parts of the federal income tax code, the income thresholds that subject Social Security benefits to taxation have never been adjusted for inflation. So, as Social Security income increases due to COLAs, both the number of retirees subject to taxation of benefits and the portion of benefits that may be taxable rise. 
CPI - when will rents go down?CPI report live updates: Inflation stays high as used car prices fall, rent climbs again
A few states want some too:These states want a cut of your Social Security check. Do you live in one of them?
Congress could pass legislation to allow income tax thresholds for taxing Social Security to be adjusted annually for inflation, the same way the IRS adjusts tax brackets. 
Here’s an example of what that might mean for someone: 
◾ Current law says if an individual’s income is between $25,000 and $34,000, you may have to pay income tax on up to 50% of benefits, and if it’s more than $34,000, up to 85% of benefits may be taxable. 
◾ If those thresholds were adjusted for inflation to 2023 dollars, then the individual filing status of $25,000 would be about $74,614, and $34,000 would be about $101,475, Johnson said. 
Congress also could change how the COLA is calculated to better reflect how seniors spend their money.  
“If that was the law today, the COLA in 2024 would be higher – about 4.2%,” Johnson estimates, using the government’s consumer price index for the elderly.  
Social Security Administration bases its COLA each year on average annual increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from July through September. The index for urban wage earners largely reflects the broad index that the Labor Department releases each month but differs slightly. Last month, while the index remained at 3.7%, the index for urban wage earners was 3.6%.   
The Seniors Citizens League uses the most recent inflation data to keep a running projection of what COLA might be next year. September is particularly important because it makes up the final month SSA officially uses to calculate 2024’s COLA. 
About 70 million Americans receive benefits from programs administered by SSA, with retired workers and their dependents accounting for 76.9% of benefits paid in 2022.    
Nearly 9 out of 10 people aged 65 and older received a Social Security benefit as of Dec. 31. Among them, 12% of men and 15% of women rely on Social Security for 90% or more of their income.   
In August, the average monthly check for Social Security beneficiaries was $1,705.79, according to SSA. A 3.2% COLA would mean about an extra $54.58 each month.   
The new COLA will be effective starting in January.

A person was arrested late Thursday morning after he exchanged gunfire with police officers in a small town in Minnesota. Parties on both sides sustaining injuries, authorities said.
The Benton County Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook that officers with the Sherburne County Drug Task Force were shot while executing a search warrant in a Benton County home, about 73 miles northwest of Minneapolis.
It's unclear if the person accused of firing at police was the intended recipient of the warrant.
The Benton County Sheriff Troy Heck didn't immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.
"The suspect was injured in the incident and was transported for treatment," according to the post. "The cause and extent of his injuries are unknown at this time."
Three task force officers from the Sherburne County Sheriff's Office wounded at the scene, according to the Benton County Sheriff's Office post, one from the Princeton Police Department and another from the Elk River Police Department, according to Benton County Sheriff's Office's post. They are all members of the Sherburne County Drug Task Force.
Robbinsdale Police Capt. John Elder told the Associated Press the three injured officers are at a hospital in Robbinsdale and the other two are in a St. Cloud hospital. He said none of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening.
Video from the scene showed law enforcement converging on a rural area with homes surrounded by farm fields.
The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension confirmed to the AP it was responding to the scene.

Cardi B crying while eating a painfully spicy chicken wing. Jack Harlow dodging a pointed question about his type while sipping a juice box. Mark Cuban attempting a Pittsburgh accent.
If you've kept up with celebrity media tours over the last few years, you've likely come across interview shows like "Hot Ones," hosted by Sean Evans; "The Really Good Podcast" by Bobbi Althoff (next interviewing Scarlett Johansson); or Amelia Dimoldenberg's "Chicken Shop Date." Though these shows' setups vary, their strategy seems the same: Place a celebrity in an extremely awkward situation and capture as many candid moments as possible.
Cringeworthy clips from these shows regularly go viral on TikTok and Instagram, begging the question: What is it about celebrities and excruciating awkwardness that makes us feel like we can't look away?
"There's a reason we are obsessed with this, and much of it has to do with the fact that, whether we mean to or not, we put celebrities on a pedestal," says Henna Pryor, a workplace performance expert and author of "Good Awkward: How to Embrace the Embarrassing and Celebrate the Cringe to Become The Bravest You." "From where we sit, they tend to be extremely good looking, extremely successful. They've got talent that drips from the sky … There's something very relatable and real about seeing them in their element and remembering they're human."
Pryor defines awkwardness as the emotion experienced when the person we believe we are isn't the person who is being perceived.
This gap between the idea of the self versus the true self is especially compelling when observed in celebrities, she says, because we feel we're getting a glimpse into who a star really is behind their carefully crafted persona.
"For a moment in time, that external reality doesn't match the identity we painted for them, and we find that fascinating," she says.
Ty Tashiro, a psychologist and author of "Awkward: The Science of Why We’re Socially Awkward and Why That’s Awesome," says awkwardness can also be instructional and therefore captivating. By watching other people's social blunders, he says, we learn what not to do.
"It's a great opportunity for us to learn about social life and social expectations and social behavior without having to risk any of our social capital," he says. "It's a real advantage to be able to learn vicariously from watching other people's awkward moments."
People love seeing celebrities in uncomfortable situations in particular, he says, because of a phenomenon called downward social comparison. Tashiro describes this as feeling better about oneself from seeing another person feel worse.
"Hot Ones," which shows celebrities struggling to eat chicken wings dipped in extraordinarily spicy hot sauce, capitalizes on this to great effect, he says.
"At that moment, we're actually doing better than the celebrity is," he says. "Something feels a little bit extra sweet about that."

Though intentionally awkward interviews may appear to put celebrities in an unflattering light, they actually do just the opposite, says Ellen Hendriksen, a clinical psychologist and author of "How to Be Yourself: Quiet Your Inner Critic and Rise Above Social Anxiety." By showing their awkward side, celebrities give the impression of vulnerability, which endears them to fans even more.
As a result, a sweaty interview over hot wings may do more to bolster a celebrity's public profile than a traditional news interview.
"When the guests put themselves in these situations and are either sweating profusely or trying to get through this super awkward interview, it's vulnerable," Hendriksen says. "What they're doing is signaling we are the same, the celebrity and the viewers, because who among us hasn't tried to play it cool or act casual when we're suffering a little? Who hasn't been stuck in an awkward conversation that has no graceful way out?"
Awkward interviews are also more prone to go viral, because they fit into the unfiltered aesthetic that's currently popular on social media.
"We went through a very perfectionistic, self-presentational phase," Hendriksen says. "The Gen-Z aesthetic is deliberately weird and ugly and cringe-y as the pendulum just swings the other way. I think we're all sick of perfection and want to see some authenticity."
Whether cringe interviews are a passing fad or here to say remains to be seen; regardless, Tashiro hopes that, in the meantime, they can empower all of us to abandon perfection and embrace our true selves − even if doing so feels a little awkward.
"There's so much pressure in celebrity culture or even influencer culture these days to present this perfect self to the rest of the world. As we know, a lot of people really suffer under that kind of pressure," he says. "I think it's great, whether it's in these shows or podcasts, to create these more genuine and real moments."
As schools and parents contend with uncomfortable and increasingly unavoidable truths about persistent learning loss, new data out Thursday points to a key source of the problem: Scores of students have in recent years missed so much school that catching up seems nearly impossible. 
The U.S. Education Department data, analyzed by Attendance Works and Johns Hopkins University’s Everyone Graduates Center, shows that in the 2021-22 school year, 2 in 3 students attended schools with high or extreme levels of chronic absence. Chronic absence typically refers to missing at least 10% of the school year, and the analysis considers a school’s levels to be high or extreme if at least a fifth of its students are chronically absent. 
Overall, roughly 30% of students were chronically absent during the 2021-22 year. It was an era still reeling from the devastation of COVID-19 – quarantines were frequent, health needs were vast and hardship was widespread. 
Going to school was hard during COVID.Why aren’t kids (or teachers) returning to class?
But as in-depth reporting by USA TODAY revealed earlier this year, attendance challenges persisted into the subsequent school year – the one that was, at long last, supposed to feel normal. A separate recent analysis by Attendance Works of 11 states’ data found only a slight decline in chronic absence from 2021-22 to 2022-23. Last school year, 28% of those state’s students were chronically absent, down from 30% the year prior. 
“An unprecedented wave of chronic absenteeism has spread across the country,” the analysis notes. “Not only is teaching and learning more challenging when large numbers of students are frequently missing class, such elevated levels of chronic absence can easily overwhelm a school’s capacity to respond.”
Kids who are chronically absent have lower odds of graduating and, especially when they miss school in the early grades, of learning how to read. And while chronic absence generally is more common at the high school level, the latest report shows the increases were especially pronounced at elementary schools. 
The rate jumped from 7% in 2017-18 to 38% in 2021-22. In fact, the number of elementary schools with extreme levels of chronic absence – more than 30% of kids missing 10% of the year – far exceeded that of high schools.
Which kids missed class during COVID?We asked, and shools don’t know.
The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee has begun a process to send financial assistance to Mary Lou Retton, the 1984 Olympic gymnastics gold medalist whose daughter says she is “fighting for her life,” USOPC spokeswoman Kate Hartman told USA TODAY Sports Thursday morning. 
“The USOPC supports the United States Olympians & Paralympians Relief Fund to offer aid to U.S. Olympians and Paralympians facing significant hardships due to illness, death or extenuating circumstances,” Hartman said. 
“Upon learning of Mary Lou's condition, we immediately took action to expedite the application process for her family to receive assistance. We are currently working through the necessary details in real-time and have reached out to Mary Lou’s family to offer our assistance.”
Retton, 55, one of the greatest names in U.S. Olympic history, “has a very rare form of pneumonia and is fighting for her life,” her daughter McKenna Kelley, a former gymnast at LSU, said in a spotfund.com post that she shared on her Instagram story Tuesday.
“She is not able to breathe on her own,” Kelley continued. “She’s been in the ICU for over a week now. Out of respect for her and her privacy, I will not disclose all details. However, I will disclose that she (is) not insured.”
In an Instagram post Wednesday, Kelley said Retton remains in the ICU and “continues to fight. She is getting incredible medical care! Thank you to all the doctors and nurses!” 
OPINION:Nearly 40 years since she barreled into history, America still loves Mary Lou Retton
Kelley has not replied to repeated messages from USA TODAY Sports seeking comment. She is the second oldest of Retton’s four daughters, all of whom have been involved in gymnastics. Retton married former University of Texas quarterback Shannon Kelley in 1990. They divorced in 2018. 
The spotfund.com donation page for Retton is showing more than $360,000 in contributions as of Thursday morning.
In what is believed to be Retton’s most recent public appearance, she gave a moderated keynote address at the USOPC’s General Assembly in Los Angeles Sept. 14. She spoke for 20 minutes to an audience of about 500, Hartman said. Most of her speech centered on her experiences at the 1984 Olympics, which were held in Los Angeles.
Hartman said that the USOPC has no further information about Retton’s health or her condition. She said the amount of money that will come from the relief fund will be kept confidential. 
“Mary Lou Retton has been an incredible icon and a source of inspiration in the U.S. Olympic movement,” Hartman said. “Her groundbreaking achievements, particularly as the first American woman to win a gold medal in gymnastics, have left an indelible mark on the sports landscape. 
“Retton's relentless spirit, verve and dedication continue to inspire countless athletes across the country, embodying the true spirit of the Olympics. We all hold her in our hearts during this challenging time and are hopeful for her to make a full recovery. Our thoughts and best wishes are with her and her family. We know that if anyone can tackle challenges with strength and grace, it's Mary Lou.”
PHOENIX − Mookie Betts, dressed in a casual black pinstripe suit, white tennis shoes and a black cap backwards on his head, stopped and said goodbye Wednesday night to several of his Los Angeles Dodgers teammates, shaking hands, sharing hugs and promising to keep in touch.
Betts was on his way out the clubhouse door when he turned around. There was Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. They wrapped their arms around each other, and Roberts whispered in his ear, congratulating him on his season.
They spoke for a few seconds, and with Roberts’ office occupied by members of the Dodgers' front office, he pointed towards the stairs, and told Betts to follow him where they could find privacy.
They stood by the indoor batting cage, just the two of them, and talked privately, spending exactly five minutes trying to make sense out what just transpired, trying to wrap their minds around the fact they were just swept out of the playoffs by the Arizona Diamondbacks. But there were no answers.
"We talked about the game," Betts told USA TODAY Sports as he walked out of the clubhouse for the final time this season. "We talked about what we could have done different. I don’t know, there’s no real cause for what happened. None."

BRAVES ON BRINK:Does Spencer Strider has what it takes to save their season?
This is a team that won 100 games, cruised to the NL West title by 16 games over the Diamondbacks, and then suddenly forget how to hit, how to pitch and how to win.
The Diamondbacks completed their sweep with a 4-2 victory over the Dodgers in front of a sellout crowd of 48,175 at Chase Field, sending Arizona to the NLCS for the first time since 2007. But the three-game sweep doesn’t come close to adequately describing just how lopsided this series was from first pitch to last.
The Dodgers never led a single inning. They trailed in 25 of the 27 innings. They were outscored by a score of 19-6.
The Dodgers were down 6-0 in the first inning of Game 1.
They were down 3-0 in the first inning of Game 2.
And they were down 4-0 in the third inning of Game 3 with the Diamondbacks setting a postseason record by hitting four homers in the inning.
"As far as the power goes, I’ve never seen something like that before," D-backs manager Torey Lovullo said. "It was almost unbelievable, right?"
It was an ugly beatdown in every conceivable way.
"We were embarrassed by the way the whole series went," Dodgers infielder/outfielder Enrique Hernandez said. "They kept punching us in the face, and we were unable to get back up. There’s not a lot of words other than I’m hurt. Disappointed. Frustrated. And a little bit embarrassed."
No team is going to win a series when its starters last a total of 4 ⅔ innings. The Dodgers rotation yielded a 20.25 ERA, allowing a .571 batting average with a 1.808 OPS. It was the fewest innings by a starting rotation in the first three games of a postseason in history.
The Diamondbacks hit nine home runs in the series, including 1,626 feet worth of homers in the fourth inning alone, while the Dodgers hit just one. The Dodgers, who scored more than 900 runs for the first time since the franchise was in Brooklyn, never scored more than two runs in any game.
"It’s easy to say it’s just baseball," said Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw, who gave up six runs in just one-third of an inning in his start, "but ultimately, we got beat in most of the facets of the game.
"Obviously, this one hurts, just the way it went down.
"A horrible way to end it, personally."
The most astonishing stat of the entire series was that Betts and Freddie Freeman, who will each finish in the top four of the MVP balloting, went 1-for-21 in the series. The lone hit was a harmless infield single by Freeman in Game 2 when D-backs pitcher Zac Gallen was late covering first base.
"It’s hard to find words right now," Freeman said. "Frustrating. Me and a lot of us didn’t play the way we wanted to. We didn’t do it for three days. Not good by us."
Said Betts: "I felt like I had prepared the right way, but I just didn’t execute anything. They pitched the ball really great. Didn’t score very many runs. I can’t speak for all of us, but I know for sure I did absolutely nothing to help us win. There’s no words for it."
This is a team that has won 211 regular season games the past two years, but have now gone 1-6 in the postseason. They finished 22 games ahead of the San Diego Padres a year ago, but lost in four games in the Division Series. They finished 16 games ahead of the Diamondbacks this year, and were brutally swept.
This is the first time the Dodgers have been swept in a postseason series since 2006, which was 118 postseason games ago.
They have also lost six consecutive postseason games for the first time since 1995-1996 when they were swept in back-to-back years in the division series.
"When you’re in the postseason, man, you’ve got to play well," said Betts, who hit .079 (3-for-38) in his past 10 postseason games. "We have not. You can point to a million different things, but at the end of the day, you have to play well."
The Dodgers did not.
Once again.
"I don’t know the answer," Roberts said, "but the bottom line is that the last two years we got outplayed in the postseason. They outplayed us in every facet of the game. …
"The regular season, I think we do a great job. But the last couple of postseasons, it just hasn’t gone well for us. It’s ironic that these are teams that we’re familiar with. So why when you get in a series, it gets flipped on its head? I just don't know that answer."
No one did.
The Dodgers, despite winning at least 100 games in four consecutive full seasons, need to make changes to assure they don’t have another short October. Not everyone is coming back in 2024.
They are expected to strongly pursue Shohei Ohtani. Maybe they’ll go after Cy Young favorite Blake Snell too. Kershaw, their three-time Cy Young award winner, says it’s too early to know whether he’ll retire or come back one more time.
All the Dodgers know for sure is that they’re sick of losing to teams they dominate during the regular season, only to lose when the stakes are the highest.
"I don’t think there’s a magic answer," Dodgers outfielder Chris Taylor said. "We just didn’t play well. It’s as simple as that. When you get to this late in the season, usually the hot team wins.
"They’re playing the best baseball they’ve played all year.
"And we were probably playing our worst baseball we’ve played all year."
It’s an easy and lazy excuse to blame it on the five-day layoff, the reward for winning the NL West with the second-best record in the league, and there wasn’t a single Dodger player who used it for an excuse.
The AL East champion Baltimore Orioles were bounced in three games, too, after their layoff. Atlanta, the NL East champion with the league’s best record, is on the brink of elimination. But it sure didn’t hurt the Houston Astros, who took down the Minnesota Twins in four games.
"I hate to say that the break got us swept," Hernandez said. "It’s just, put everything aside, we just didn’t play good baseball. There’s no other way to put it."
The Diamondbacks, of course, had something to do with the Dodgers’ failures. They privately believed that when the Dodgers clobbered them in August, outscoring them 23-5 in a three-game sweep at Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers were picking up their pitches.
This time, the Diamondbacks changed their routine, and made sure they weren’t tipping their pitches. They constantly changed speeds and locations, and rarely threw the same pitch twice in shutting down Freeman and Betts.
"There’s definitely a way to pitch to them," Lovullo said. "You can’t duplicate pitches. You got to change locations. You got to change speeds. You got to start on the chalk lines, you’re (working) your way in, and just get a feeling for what they’re doing per at-bat. And you just hope they make a swing mistake or a bad decision and get themselves out.
"It was a well-executed plan, and maybe we just caught them at the right time."
After upsetting the Milwaukee Brewers in the wild-card round and the Dodgers in the Division Series, the D-backs know they’ll be heavy underdogs whether they play the Philadelphia Phillies or Atlanta.
No matter.
They finally slayed the dragon, and, man, did it ever feel good.
"I think it’s an understatement to say we were counted out, especially in this series," Gallen said. "And obviously, it’s no secret we’ve had our battles with them, our struggles.
"But this one tastes a little bit sweeter, for sure, especially since I heard some comments that this was going to be a home game for them.
"But that’s our pool."
Yep, after the Dodgers jumped into the D-backs pool and celebrated their division title in 2013, the D-backs finally got sweet revenge a decade later, with their whole team taking a late-night swim.
POOL PARTY:D-backs celebrate NLDS sweep over Dodgers with a splash!
So, go ahead, feel free to count the D-backs out in the NLCS like everyone else.
They dare you.
“Right now, we’re dangerous,’’ said D-backs rookie starter Brandon Pfaadt, who pitched 4 ⅓ scoreless innings. “People don’t want to play us. So we got some momentum in our favor.
“I think we’ll keep showing people who we are.’’

If you or a business, trade group or other institution with which you are associated stands to gain financially or in any other way from your column, you should disclose that information in detail. In most cases, it should also be included in the body of the piece or in the author's biographical information.
