A series of town hall forums presented by USA TODAY, the USA TODAY Network and Seacoastonline for Republican presidential hopefuls are set to take place in Exeter, New Hampshire this week.
The forums will take place at Exeter Town Hall, where many former presidents, including Donald Trump and Barack Obama, have campaigned. The forums are scheduled to take place Oct. 10-15.
Former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley met with voters on Thursday night. You can watch video of the town hall above this story.
Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson kicked off with the first town hall event Tuesday and you can watch the replay here.
Exeter Town Hall has the distinction of being the only location remaining in New Hampshire where Abraham Lincoln spoke in 1860, just months before launching his presidential campaign.
Voters who attend will have a chance to directly ask candidates the questions on their mind and receive in-person responses.
The town hall forums will be streamed on USA TODAY and on USA TODAY Network outlets including Seacoastonline.com, Portsmouth Herald, Hampton Union, Foster's Daily Democrat and Exeter News-Letter.
The five candidates that have committed to meeting with voters are Asa Hutchinson, Nikki Haley, Doug Burgum, Mike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy.
Here is the full schedule for the Exeter Town Hall forums this week. All times are Eastern.
The forums are free and open to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis. At the start of the forums, candidates make their brief opening remarks before proceeding to answer questions from the audience and engage in a meaningful dialogue about various issues.  
Former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate Asa Hutchinson positioned himself as an anti-Trump, traditional Republican during his USA Today New Hampshire Town Hall Tuesday.
Hutchinson said, "we need a course correction in the Republican Party" in front of a handful of New Hampshire voters at Exeter Town Hall in Exeter, New Hampshire.
The former two term Arkansas governor argued that the country should take a larger role in the international order saying that former President Donald Trump wants a, "ring around the United States."
SDEROT, Israel − They are finding people in basements and stores. Hiding out in one of the rows of abandoned houses and small apartment blocks. On rooftops.
After regaining territorial control, elite Israeli police and military units are actively searching for remaining gunmen, whenever and wherever they find them, a little less than a week after Hamas stormed this town of 30,000 people on the edge of the Gaza Strip.
"Their food and water supply are running out," said a sniper in an anti-terrorism police unit in Sderot who USA TODAY spent time with on patrol Wednesday, referring to Hamas militants. "We're getting more of them now because they need to do something. Move from place to place."
Over 1,000 Hamas fighters infiltrated 22 towns and army bases in a multi-front attack that caught Israel's military off guard. For Israel, this represents the biggest intelligence failure in decades − a blow to a country known for having robust security that is the envy of the world.
Thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed, and thousands more on both sides injured. Over 100 were kidnapped, including more than a dozen Americans.
Such a dramatic and unprecedented attack set off a panic across the world's Jewish communities from the U.S. and Mexico to France and beyond along with Israelis scrambling to track down their loved ones. The attacks are being referred to as Israel's 9/11.
Tuesday night in Sderot and the surrounding areas, 23 gunmen had been hunted down and, ultimately, killed.
On Friday, the Israeli government announced it was evacuating the town.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has targeted Hamas, saying, "every Hamas member is a dead man." As he tries to regain complete territorial control of a country roughly the size of New Jersey, Netanyahu has mounted a large-scale air strike in Gaza that killed more than 1,350 people and put tanks along the border. Now, patrol cars are zooming the militarized streets of southern Israel.
The member of the police unit, a sniper, asked for his name to be withheld because of the sensitive nature of his work and concern over potential reprisals from Hamas against him or his family. He said he killed two members of Hamas on Saturday during the initial assault on Sderot. At least 27 police officers like him were killed in the area. As for civilians, police still won't say.
The sniper spent Tuesday night on a roof of an Israeli military base that was briefly captured by Hamas on the first day of the siege. The base sits off of a main road that looks over and across to the nearby Gaza barrier. He said his unit was authorized to kill anyone who tried to cross this road without permission.
"We are waiting for new waves of Hamas to come," he said.
Israeli authorities are also continuously mobilizing to trace, capture and kill, if necessary, Hamas holdouts in and around Sderot, even though Israel's Defense Forces says it has regained full control of the areas of the south like Sderot that were attacked by Hamas.
Roei Valdman, a commander in Israel's police who is responsible for an area that includes Gaza, Sderot and several other cities, said that his officers are being inundated with calls from people "who hear terrorists, who hear shootings... People are afraid."
Valdman estimated that approximately 1% of these calls turn out to be "a real case, a real event." However, he said that it was not possible to know for sure how many Hamas members could still be in Sderot or the surrounding area.
For the actual cases of Hamas infiltrators identified, "it's a hunt." His forces, side by side with the military, deploy helicopters, armored vehicles and other specialized equipment to catch or kill them.
Hamas, he said, was still managing to cross the Gaza border in "ones and twos" but so far, for the last several days, they have not been able to attack any civilians.
Valdman spoke from Sderot's temporary police headquarters, a community center in the town. On Saturday, Hamas seized Sderot's police station, leading to a standoff with security forces that lasted through the night until Valdman's commander, Amir Cohen, decided to have it demolished with bulldozers, with members of Hamas trapped inside.
Eight of Valdman's officers were killed inside the station as it was overrun by Hamas. They were heavily outgunned and outmanned. About two dozen Hamas members occupied the station, around which they had set up booby traps preventing police from storming it.
Cohen, a senior border police commander, sported a shiner on Wednesday in the halls of the center. The black eye was the result, an aide said, of Cohen fighting off Hamas as the attack on Sderot unfolded.
Valdman said that there were only 10 officers in Sderot on duty when they were attacked. The assault fell in the middle of a Jewish holiday. With the army overwhelmed along the border, the defense of the town fell to the police for the first hours.
Eventually, an elite counter-terrorism unit with the Israel Defense Forces came with reinforcements.
"Of course we are trained to deal with terrorism but most of the time we are dealing with crime and ordinary citizen concerns around here," said Valdman, who believes the fast response from his officers helped prevent a larger massacre in Sderot.
The makeshift police station at the center of town was swarming this week with hundreds of rescue workers, police, army and special forces. They filtered in and out on different missions. Donations − meals, soap and toothpaste, cases upon cases of water − sat on an outdoor concrete square that had a basketball court on it and was covered from the sun.
Israel's President Isaac Herzog paid a brief visit and urged the international community to demand the release of hostages taken by Hamas.
Throughout the hour, air raid sirens would go off, sending several dozen people who were loitering outside smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee and making small talk scrambling for cover inside. This was followed by loud thuds and bangs. On Sunday, the center received a direct hit from one of the barrage of missiles that Hamas is sending over the border each day. But the damage was not significant. And no one was hurt.
"A week ago, I had just come back from a vacation in Norway, and I thought I was about to go on a work trip to Canada. I barely had time to wash my clothes before I was called up for duty," said one soldier, who was passing by a USA TODAY reporter as he waited on a wooden bench inside the center for the latest all clear after a round of missile fire from Gaza.
The patrol unit that the sniper is part of is working 12-hour shifts to investigate every serious report that comes in about Hamas militants: sightings, strange noises, rumors.
It also rushes to the scene of rocket attacks in Sderot to assist any wounded and because, according to the sniper, "sometimes Hamas attacks places it has just fired on."
There's a lot of time sitting around, eating snacks, some good-humored roasting. At one point, the sniper was given a shoulder massage by another member of his unit.
"This work is not too scary if you don't think about it too much," confided another officer.
Like the sniper, none of the other officers can be identified for security reasons.
A lot of time sitting around − until there isn't.
A crackly message came through on the radio.
A dozen heavily armed police commandoes and one reporter piled into two large vans and sped around Sderot's deserted streets. Up front, in the passenger's seat, the unit's commander wedged his automatic weapon, ready to fire, between the vehicle's mirror and its windshield frame. Many of the town's residents have evacuated to other parts of Israel, but many have remained behind. They've been told to stay indoors.
The report that had come in was of a rocket attack on a house in Sderot.
The location was near a cluster of homes on a cul-de-sac.
Within a few minutes of arriving it became clear there was no sign of a rocket here. Just a dog barking in a high pitch and a couple of residents trying to communicate and gesture to the unit from behind a head-level wall outside their home about 50 feet away.
Then, another report came. There may have been shots fired.
"Get down," the unit's commander ordered.
That too was over before it started.
Back in the van, yet another order had arrived, this time to search a house where a rocket definitely had landed just 10 minutes earlier.
"We're going to do a quick check for casualties," said the sniper, shortly before the door was kicked open. In the sky above, small clusters of shiny smoke trails could be seen.
These could be rockets just launched from Gaza, where the intensity of Israel's bombing campaign has sent up large plumes of dust and ash and led to scenes of apocalyptic destruction. Or Israeli missiles sent to intercept them.
Inside, the house seemed lived in.
A half-eaten piece of chocolate cake, spoon resting quietly on a plate, sat on the dining table. There was a jumble of clothes strewn across the sofa. A musty human odor.
The rocket had fallen straight through what looked like the main bedroom and hallway upstairs, exposing a twisted and gnarly web of wires, plaster, wooden beams, steel mesh.
The stairway, walls, doors, floor and ceiling were covered in a light gray dust. A part of the missile was lying in the bathroom, near the toilet.
No wounded, no people, though. No signs of Hamas.
"It's clean," said the sniper. "We're leaving. Stay close."

WASHINGTON — The House fell into further chaos Thursday night after House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., withdrew from the speaker's race despite being formally nominated by the House Republican conference, underscoring the deep divisions that have consumed GOP lawmakers.
Scalise’s withdrawal comes after the historic ouster of the chamber's former speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who was removed from his post by just eight GOP lawmakers in a vote last week. Scalise, who served as House Majority Leader, the No. 2 ranking House Republican, was largely expected to launch a speakership bid following McCarthy’s removal.
“It’s been quite a journey and there’s still a long way to go. I just shared with my colleagues that I’m withdrawing my name,” Scalise told reporters exiting a closed-door conference meeting. “Our conference still has to come together and is not there.”
Scalise, addressing the infighting that has roiled House Republicans, accused conservative holdouts in the speaker’s race of having their own “agenda.” 
“There are still some people that have their own agendas and I was very clear, we have to put our own agendas on the side and focus on what this country needs,” Scalise said. “Clearly not everybody is there, there are still schisms that need to be resolved.”
Uncertainty surrounded Scalise’s bid for speaker, even after he was formally nominated by his fellow lawmakers on Wednesday, given the deep fractures that run through the House Republican conference. Some GOP lawmakers, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., expressed concerns over Scalise's health considering he is currently battling blood cancer.
Scalise's prompt withdrawal after just one day of being nominated reflects the arduous path any prospective speaker has ahead of them to lead the lower chamber where Republicans control the House by just four votes. Since January, every GOP lawmaker has been given an outsized amount of power over any decision in Congress, including the current speaker's race which has no clear resolution in sight.
Without a speaker, the House is paralyzed, unable to take any legislative action, including foreign aid as a war between Israeli and Palestinian militants raged in the middle east.
The path forward for House Republicans to elect a new speaker is unclear considering GOP lawmakers seemingly can not coalesce behind a single possible leader.
Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, was Scalise’s main rival in the speaker’s race but after he lost an internal conference vote to be nominated, the Ohio Republican fell behind Scalise and attempted to rally support for the majority leader. It is already uncertain if Jordan will seek the nomination again but even more uncertain if he can even unite a deeply fractured House GOP conference behind him.
Despite the gridlock, a sense of urgency has befallen House Republicans to crown a new speaker for the lower chamber to take legislative action again with a looming government shutdown and a key U.S. ally in Israel fighting a rapidly growing war against Hamas militants.
But it's safe to say no one knows what happens now. A number of Republicans quickly condemned the chaos over the speakership, saying it does nothing good for the party or country.
Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a president candidate, called the House Republicans "the gang that can’t shoot straight." On the X media site, Christie said, "we have big issues in this country and across the world. Our country and our party need a House Speaker. It’s time for them to make a decision and move forward."
Pollster Frank Luntz, who has worked with McCarthy over the years said that “There is no precedent. There is no direction. There is no leadership. And most importantly, no one is willing to put country over party or politics.”
The House has been frozen in place since earlier this month, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., introduced a motion to vacate that would remove McCarthy from his position as speaker.
The move came amid growing tensions between McCarthy and several Republican ultra-conservative lawmakers over key fights concerning the debt ceiling and government shutdown.
Gaetz also cited several reasons for why McCarthy should be ousted, such as not holding votes on issues like term limits for lawmakers or releasing the full security tapes from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.
208 Democrats and eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy. The list of eight includes Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Rep. Matt Rosendale of Montana.
Gaetz told reporters after the vote that “it’s the benefit of this country that we have a better speaker of the House than Kevin McCarthy.”
Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, was chosen to be acting House speaker from a succession list that McCarthy had provided in January. 
A police officer was shot and killed and another was wounded after the pair confronted people breaking into a car in a parking garage at Philadelphia International Airport.
Interim Police Commissioner John Stanford said in a news conference Thursday night that the officers were arriving for work just after 11 p.m. and parked in the garage when they saw a few people breaking into a car in the garage area.
As the officers approached them, the suspects opened fire. One officer was shot multiple times in the upper torso and was pronounced dead at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center just after 11:30 p.m., Stanford said.
The other officer was shot in the arm and is in stable condition at Jefferson University Hospital.
The shooting was reported in the Terminal D parking garage, Stanford said.
Stanford said preliminary information shows the suspects fled the scene in a Dodge Durango, but police are still trying to confirm that information.

Shortly after the shooting, a black Dodge Durango dropped off an 18-year-old man at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with two gunshot wounds, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, where he was pronounced dead.
Stanford said they had not yet confirmed that the vehicle and man were involved in the shooting of the officers.
Stanford noted that the shooting came on the heels of three officers getting shot and wounded while responding to a call in Northeast Philadelphia.
“A numb, numb moment for us, to again encounter something like this,” Stanford said. “We just had three officers shot last week. And then this tonight, so you can imagine what we feel. We can imagine what this department is going through. And quite frankly, how the city should be feeling,” he said.
Terminal D and the Terminal D/E parking garage were both closed Thursday night due to the investigation, but reopened Friday morning.

The United Nations is calling for Israel to rescind an immediate evacuation order it issued for about a million Palestinians living in Gaza, with the U.N. calling the order "horrendous" and warning of a deepening humanitarian crisis.
The Israeli military announced the Gaza evacuation Friday. It's an unprecedented order for about half the population of the sealed-off territory ahead of an expected ground invasion against the ruling Hamas militant group. Palestinians have said there is no real escape in Gaza, which has been under a suffocating 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt. 
"The scale and speed of the unfolding humanitarian crisis is bone-chilling. Gaza is fast becoming a hell hole and is on the brink of collapse," the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said in a Friday statement. "The call from Israeli Forces to move more than 1,000,000 civilians living in northern Gaza within 24 hours is horrendous. This will only lead to unprecedented levels of misery and further push people in Gaza into the abyss."
Hamas, which staged a shocking and brutal attack on Israel nearly a week ago and has fired thousands of rockets since, dismissed the evacuation as a ploy and called on people to stay in their homes.
Alarmed civilians and aid workers, who were already in distress from Israeli airstrikes and a blockade, were sent into chaos. Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City, told The Associated Press through tears that there was no way one million people could evacuate that fast.
“Forget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel. The only concern now is just if you make it, if you’re going to live,” Farsakh said.

Developments:
∎ The number of Palestinians displaced increased by 25% over the past 24 hours, according to an early Friday update from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. More than 423,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza and two-thirds are taking shelter at U.N schools.
∎ Airstrikes have left cities and refugee camps in ruins. And Gaza has been experiencing a full electricity blackout amid Israel's siege of the territory, "which has brought essential health, water and sanitation services to the brink of collapse, and exacerbated food insecurity" according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz has said electricity, water and fuel will not be provided until Israeli hostages are returned.
∎ Public officials and law enforcement agencies across the United States have expressed concern over potential protests on Friday in response to Hamas leadership's call for a global "Day of Rage." The D.C. region has enhanced its security in the area, including in the U.S. Capitol complex, and other major cities have also been on alert.
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.
Gaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian exclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.
Hamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.

EXETER, N.H. − Americans need to stand behind Israel − and that includes former President Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said Thursday.
“While we have their back now that they’ve been hit, what’s more important is that we have their back when they hit back,” Haley said at a New Hampshire town hall sponsored by the USA TODAY Network.
The former ambassador to the United Nations said Hamas must be eliminated and “we need to remember who the true backer of all this is – Iran.”
Haley, who served under Trump, also went after her former boss who, at a rally Wednesday, called Hezbollah – an ally of Hamas –“very smart.” And Trump said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “let us down” just before the U.S. killed a top Iranian general in 2020.
Haley said such comments are why it’s time for a new generation of leaders to “leave the negativity and chaos and the baggage” in the past.
“We can’t have someone who is so clouded with the past that they can’t see the future,” she said to whistles and applause. “Donald Trump was the right president at the right time. I don’t think he’s the right president now.”
After strong performances in the first two GOP debates, Haley has jumped in the polls, including in a recent USA TODAY/Boston Globe/Suffolk University survey of likely New Hampshire voters.
She surged ahead of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who lost the standing he once held as the dominant alternative to Trump.
But the 19% of likely New Hampshire voters who backed Haley is still far behind the 49% supporting former President Donald Trump.
Still, Trump has shifted his focus from attacking DeSantis to going after Haley.
Janet Jenkins, a retired teacher from Southbridge, Mass., drove two hours with her husband to Exeter, N.H., to hear Haley speak.
“I just think she has what it takes,” said Jenkins, who has read two of Haley’s books. “I like her demeanor, the way she talks.”
What both Janet and her husband, Bob, most wanted to hear from Haley was how she thinks she can win the nomination.
“Trump is so far ahead,” Bob Jenkins said.
Haley has recently expanded her operations in both Iowa and New Hampshire.
She’s stood out from the field with aggressive debate appearances that included criticizing Trump for adding to the national debt and telling entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.”
In a party that hasn’t unified beyond a position on a national abortion ban, Haley argues the focus should be on areas where Democrats and Republicans can find common ground.
“Stop demonizing this issue,” she said. “We have to humanize it.”
She also went after both parties for not addressing major problems facing the country. Minutes into her remarks, she said her party shares some of the blame for the federal debt.
“You don’t fix Democratic chaos with Republican chaos,” she said later in the town hall. "We need stability. We need focus. We need discipline."
That message appealed to Dixy Scott, 78, an independent from Raymond, N.H., who has been turned off by Republicans since Trump came on the scene.
"She's given me hope," Scott said of Haley.
Sapna Arvind had always dreamed of having a big career in finance.
“My dad, when I was a child, would say, ‘I wanna see you on CNBC,’ "she says. “So I did my undergrad in finance at New York University with those words ringing in my ears.”
Arvind embarked on a career in asset management in New York City after getting an MBA in finance from MIT Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, Massachusetts. By her mid-30s, she was also a mother of two children under the age of 10.
While she’d powered through the early years as a young mother and a professional woman, by the time her younger one was ready for kindergarten, she didn’t want to do it anymore – commuting back to her home in the suburbs at 8 p.m. just as the kids were getting ready for bed.
She decided to quit her job. Her husband, an investment banker, would be the sole breadwinner while she’d be the primary “on-call” parent.
It’s a decision scores of college-educated women have made over the years and which, in part, explains why the gender earnings gap is wider among college-educated women compared with those without a college degree.
In 2022, for example, women with at least a bachelor’s degree earned 79% as much as men who were college graduates, while women who were high school graduates earned 81% as much as men with the same level of education, according to the Pew Research Center.
That is also a topic Harvard professor Claudia Goldin, 77, who received a Nobel Prize in economics for her groundbreaking work on women in the labor market on Monday, has spent decades studying.
After collecting and analyzing 200 years of U.S. historical data to demonstrate how and why gender differences in earnings and employment rates have changed over time, she found that while historically, the wage gap could be explained through differences in education and occupational choices, recently, the differences among men and women in the same profession widens after the birth of the first child.
Goldin’s research also finds this trend: Differences in both pay and the ability to stay in the workforce reflect differences in the division of unpaid caregiving responsibilities between heterosexual couples.
Goldin's recent research has also found that while mothers make less than non-mothers because of the reduced number of hours they work, fathers make more than non-fathers over the course of their careers.
“Quite frankly, it's the most disturbing part of this," Goldin told USA TODAY in a phone interview Tuesday, a day after she won the Nobel prize. "Why is it that fathers are doing better (than non-fathers), even though they have kids? Why is the fatherhood premium growing over time?" she asks, adding that "the price of being a woman stays constant (due to social norms around gender), which is also somewhat disturbing.”
Goldin says women with children enable men with children to achieve more.
“Men are able to step forward because women step backward. It's not simply taking the shirts to the dry cleaner that women do, they are boosting their ability to do work,” Goldin says. “And therefore, if you are by yourself, you don't have the ability to have that help mate.”
The other explanation is the American notion of masculinity that places a self-imposed pressure to achieve more when you are a father.
“This internal sense that fathers have, that they really have to run fast because they are breadwinners,” she says.
When it comes to college-educated women, high-salary jobs with long, inflexible hours exacerbate the gender pay gap. When women take on “greedy” work, which pays disproportionately more when they work a greater number of hours or have less control over those hours, they tend not to last long because they opt out to raise families.
The pandemic, Goldin says had decreased the cost of flexibility as firms and workers have learned to use technologies that enable remote meetings. 
“One of the big hurdles is business travel," she says. "It’s an enormous barrier to individuals with care responsibilities. But “if that job now changed to, you don't have to travel to Tokyo, you have to Zoom with Tokyo clients every other weekend, you can do it.”
Making greedy jobs more flexible would allow more women to take them, Goldin says.
When Jane Vernon moved to the suburbs from New York City with two preschoolers, she worked for a Fortune 500 company that had offered her part-time work during her early days of motherhood.
“What part-time meant was partial pay for nearly full-time work but I made the deal because it allowed me to go to the office three rather than five days per week,” says the Yale graduate and Harvard MBA.
Her hard work didn’t go unnoticed—she was offered a promotion, but the catch was that needed to be physically present five days per week.
“Despite the fact that I had excelled while working ‘part-time’ my hiring boss required face time, being physically present every day of the week, and was not sympathetic to the demands of motherhood, “ Veron says. “She said that juggling family concerns was not relevant.”
She decided to quit her job.
If she’d had flexibility, things would have been very different.
“Without a doubt, I would have stayed in the workforce,” she says. “I did not want to quit my job.”
Her life as a Scarsdale mom, one of the most expensive zip codes in the country, landed her in familiar company: stay-at-home moms with degrees from prestigious universities and experience in the corporate world, including at white-shoe law firms, exclusive management consultancies and Fortune 500 companies.
Vernon established The Acceleration Project, a nonprofit consulting firm in 2012 to help small businesses that were dealing with the aftermath of the economic recession by channeling the talents of these “opt-out” moms with expertise in everything from law, business marketing and finance.
The nonprofit now has more than 200 volunteers who work part-time or full-time with the organization.
"While TAP started with moms who left their fast-paced careers, more of consultants hold full or part-time jobs," says Veron. "They say they choose to work with us as we provide opportunities for professionals to use their skills for meaningful impact."
Carol Fishman Cohen, a Pomona College and Harvard Business School graduate, took an 11-year break in the 1990s to raise her four children in a Boston suburb before going back to work full-time at Bain Capital.
In Cohen’s case, her husband had been working at a law firm for 20 years when she was going back to work. He had a demanding job but had little travel. This, and the fact that she had a nanny to take care of her children ages 5 to 11, enabled her to return to a high-pressure job that required travel.
“My husband handled things like doctor visits, sick kids, and unexpected events,” she says.
When considering childcare costs, couples should evaluate being able to afford childcare based on their combined projected income, not based on the incremental income the returning partner is making.
“Because initially, it can be a breakeven situation. However, this is temporary and an investment in the more profitable years to come,” she says. 
She is now the founder and CEO of career reentry firm iRelaunch, which produces the iRelaunch Return to Work Conferences and works with companies on career reentry programs.
The share of prime-age women who are employed hit an all-time high of 76% in June and experts believe the flexibility to work remotely contributed to the surge.
In June, 77.8% of women ages 25 to 54 were working or looking for jobs, up from 77.6% in May and the highest in U.S. history, the Labor Department’s July jobs report showed.
About 35% of people who can do their jobs remotely are working from home, up from just 7% before the pandemic, according to the Pew Research Center.
It depends, given that we are seeing various degrees of in-office requirements, says Cohen.
“In the past, we saw expectations of ‘facetime' in the office, 24/7 accountability and ‘spontaneous travel,’ meaning jumping on a plane with little or no notice, drive out female professionals disproportionately from finance roles that were fast-paced and transactional,” she says. “Less travel enabled by video calls is a huge factor in retaining mothers - and some fathers too.”
Goldin says couple equity, where each would share the “on-call at home” duties and each could also achieve in their career, would help narrow the gap. That would entail leaving a lot of money on the table, as each passes up the high pressure promotion, partner track or tenure track. 
Arvind, who quit her job as a vice president in asset management at Alliance Bernstein when her older son was nine, says mothering while working was an “emotional rollercoaster.”
“I'd feel so guilty. Like, they would call from school, and I'd be like, ‘Sorry, I'm in a meeting,” she says. “I felt the call to parent even more when they were in elementary and middle school when they’d bring back so much stuff .... mental and social stuff that I just couldn't solve in the moment. I felt like I was always trying to catch up.”
But staying at home wasn’t easy.“Every three months I go through this existential angst about what am I doing with my skillset," she says. "I don't want to be doing nothing. I don't want to be called just a housewife. I want to have a title that says I'm not just mom and wife.”
After four years of mulling over how her life had "devolved into nothingness," and looking for and giving up on part-time jobs in finance in Westchester, Arvind decided to expand her skillset and pivot from finance to education.
She went back to school for a master's degree in economics and education at Columbia Teacher’s College (taking more courses than required for her degree) and now works as a consultant at a firm that maps and analyzes the prenatal to five funding streams with various state governments. She also serves on the board of Child Care Council of Westchester.
The consultant job offers flexibility and is a remote position. Eventually, she hopes to get back into finance as a venture capitalist in the education-tech field.
Asked if the earnings gap would further narrow or even disappear in the future, Goldin says she’s terrible with predictions.
“I’m not very good at looking into the future. I’ve been wrong about every piece of device that has appeared, including the cell phone."
Laughing, she says she nailed one prediction: the Barbie movie.
"I said, this is going to be really, really, really big.”

The Kansas City Chiefs’ latest victory looked a lot like their last few.
Outplay the opposition, but let them stick around to make it a game. When it came time to execute in the fourth quarter, the game really wasn’t a contest.
Kansas City, winners of five straight, stifled the Denver Broncos 19-8 on “Thursday Night Football.” It's the Chiefs’ 16th straight victory over their AFC West rival. And yes, there was famous pop singer watching from the suite section of Arrowhead Stadium cheering on tight end Travis Kelce, who was questionable entering the game with an ankle injury. But Kelce went off with seven catches and 109 yards in the first half (and finished with nine catches for 124 yards). 
Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was 30 of 40 for 306 yards through the air with a touchdown and one interception. Rookie wideout Rashee Rice had four catches for 72 yards, while running back Isiah Pacheco rushed 16 times for 62 yards. 
Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson threw two picks and finished with just 95 passing yards (13-for-22) and 31 rushing yards (four attempts).

Harrison Butker made all four of his field-goal attempts; his 60-yarder as time expired in the first half made it 13-0 and his 52-yarder out of the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter iced the game. 
Here are the winners and losers of "Thursday Night Football":
Mahomes didn’t play a great game by his standards, but he was the best player on the field Thursday.
Mahomes went 30-for-40 passing for 306 yards. He tossed one touchdown and one interception and finished with a passer rating of 94.4.
Jones tallied four tackles, one sack, one pass deflection and three QB hits. Jones has recorded a sack in eight straight games.
Travis Kelce was more productive by himself than the entire Broncos offense in the first half.
Kelce had 109 receiving yards in the first two quarters. The Broncos produced 94 total yards in the first half.
Kelce ended with nine catches and 124 receiving yards in the win. Seven of Kelce’s nine receptions were on hitch routes, according to Next Gen Stats.
Rice is slowly become Kansas City’s best wide receiver.
He had a nice 28-yard catch and run on third down in the fourth quarter. The rookie wideout led all Chiefs wide receivers with four catches for 72 yards. He caught all four of his targets.
Mahomes’ connection with Rice is steadily improving.
The Broncos had the NFL’s worst defense entering Week 6, giving up the most points (36.2) and yards (450.6) per game. But Denver’s defense fought hard on the road and limited the Chiefs to 19 points and 389 total yards.
It was Denver’s offense that couldn’t get into a rhythm.
The Broncos’ lone touchdown didn’t come until the fourth quarter. They only managed one drive of over 50 yards.
Broncos QB Russell Wilson was subpar. He had a meager 95 passing yards and just one touchdown and two interceptions.
Wide receiver Courtland Sutton led the Broncos with four catches, 46 receiving yards and a touchdown.
The Chiefs have now defeated the Broncos 16 straight times. Denver’s last victory over Kansas City was on Sept. 17, 2015.
Unfortunately for Denver, it faces the Chiefs again in Week 8.
Thursday’s loss dropped the Broncos to 1-5 on the season.
Since 2015, the Chiefs have a 43-6 record against AFC West opponents.
The Chiefs have won the AFC West for seven consecutive seasons and are well on their way to winning an eighth straight division title. They are the only team in the division currently with a winning record.
Patrick Mahomes took a sack on third down that made Harrison Butker’s kick 50-plus yards. However, the distance didn’t matter.
Butker split the uprights on a 52-yard field goal that made it a 19-8 game.
Butker’s 52-yard field goal to give the Chiefs some breathing room also had significant wagering implications. The spread entering the game, according to BetMGM, was 10.5 points.
Butker is 4-for-4 on field goals in the game.
The Broncos have some life.
Denver finally scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter when wide receiver Courtland Sutton made an acrobatic 11-yard catch in the end zone for a touchdown. The officials initially called it an incomplete pass, but the Broncos challenged the call, and it was reversed. Denver then got the two-point conversion to make it a 16-8 game.
The Broncos’ scoring drive was eight plays and went 61 yards. It was Denver’s first drive of the game over 50 yards. 
— Tyler Dragon
Both teams ended the third quarter by trading punts. Both teams are under 40% on third-down attempts for the game. Russell Wilson had 44 passing yards entering the fourth. 
Broncos tight end Greg Dulcich is questionable to return with a hamstring injury. He'd missed the four previous games due to a hamstring injury suffered in Week 1.
— Chris Bumbaca 
Once again, a Russell Wilson interception killed a Denver drive in Kansas City territory.
This time, Chiefs linebacker Willie Gay leaped from the line of scrimmage and batted a Wilson pass intended for tight end Greg Dulcich. The ball landed in safety Justin Reid’s arms for Wilson’s second interception of the game. 
The Broncos had moved the ball 47 yards in six plays in a two-possession game. Kansas City took over at its own 25 with 5:40 left in the third. 
— Chris Bumbaca 
Harrison Butker has been a busy man, as the Chiefs offense stalled once again inside the red zone. 
Butker’s 25-yard field goal made gave Kansas City a 16-0 lead 5:44 into the third quarter and capped a 12-play drive. The big gain came via a 23-yard connection between Mahomes and rookie wideout Rashee Rice. Running back Isiah Pacheco (11 rushes, 55 yards) has eclipsed the 55-yard mark for the fourth consecutive game. 
— Chris Bumbaca 
A fairly stereotypical – as in, snoozy – first half of “TNF” ended with the Kansas City Chiefs leading the Denver Broncos 13-0. 
Harrison Butker’s 60-yard field goal as time expired was one of the more exciting plays of the half. A 13-yard Patrick Mahomes scramble set up the score. 
The flow of the game has made it seem like the Kansas City lead is more than 10, but Denver’s defense has stood strong in the red zone, holding the Chiefs to one successful trip in four tries. 
Mahomes is 15 of 23 for 162 yards with one touchdown, a 3-yard pitch-and-catch with Kadarius Toney in the second quarter. Travis Kelce, with beau Taylor Swift in attendance, has seven catches for 109 yards. 
Russell Wilson (7-for-11, 37 yards) has been sacked three times and is averaging 3.4 yards per pass attempt.
— Chris Bumbaca 
The Chiefs scored the game’s first touchdown on their fourth possession.
Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes found WR Kadarius Toney wide open outside on a flat route for a 3-yard touchdown. 
Chiefs TE Travis Kelce had two nice catches during the seven play, 62-yard touchdown drive, including a 19-yard catch that made Taylor Swift get up and cheer.
Kelce has a game-high seven catches for 109 yards in the first half. 
— Tyler Dragon
The NFL cannot get enough of the tush push. 
Problem is, nobody can execute the short-yardage play quite like the Philadelphia Eagles. 
With 8:10 left in the first half and the Chiefs facing a fourth-and-2 from the Broncos’ 6-yard line, head coach Andy Reid called for a fake field goal. Second-string tight end Noah Gray lined up under center and got a push from behind via punter Tommy Townsend and offensive lineman Wanya Morris. But Gray could not advance the ball past the first-down marker and the Broncos escaped another Kansas City red-zone appearance with zero points allowed. 
The Chiefs are 0-for-3 in the red zone and have three points despite winning the field position battle thus far. 
— Chris Bumbaca
The Broncos and Chiefs have traded turnovers in the first quarter.
Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes threw an interception right after Kansas City’s defense forced a takeaway.
Mahomes was standing in the pocket looking for an open receiver. With the pocket collapsing around him, he tossed an ill-advised pass near the end zone that was intercepted by Broncos safety Justin Simmons.
Simmons returned the interception 6 yards to the Denver 7-yard line.
The interception was the first of the season for Simmons.
— Tyler Dragon
The Broncos were having success running the ball. 
Then Russell Wilson ended the party. 
Wilson threw an interception to Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton, who was sitting underneath a Broncos receiver in zone coverage. Wilson never saw him, and the Chiefs got the ball back on the 43-yard line. It was Wilson’s third interception of the season. 
— Chris Bumbaca
The Chiefs’ opening drive stalled in the red zone, but they were able to get three points on kicker Harrison Butker’s 35-yard field goal.
Kansas City’s opening drive was highlighted by tight end Travis Kelce's 5-yard catch and lateral to fellow tight end Noah Gray. Gray was able to pick up an additional seven yards after the lateral. The play helped set up the Chiefs in field goal position.
The Chiefs covered 42 total yards on their opening drive. 
— Tyler Dragon
Denver came up empty on the opening drive of the game despite moving the ball into Kansas City territory. 
The Broncos converted a third-and-2 when Javonte Williams bounced off a pair of tacklers but Russell Wilson was driven out of bounds by Justin Reid on the subsequent fourth down.  
The drive lasted nine plays and took 5:36 off the clock.
— Chris Bumbaca
Fresh off attending the premiere of her "Eras Tour" movie in Los Angeles on Wednesday, Taylor Swift is off to Kansas City for another one of her passions: watching Kansas City Chiefs football games.
Swift was spotted Thursday arriving at the Chiefs' game against the Denver Broncos. The singer wore a black dress, paired with a red varsity jacket. She was then seen sitting next to Travis Kelce's mother, Donna.

All eyes were on the Chiefs' inactive list prior to Thursday night's for official word on Travis Kelce's game status. The star tight end is a go.
Kelce is active despite his ankle injury and will be suiting up against the Denver Broncos.
Former NFL wide receiver Steve Smith Sr. tried to make peace with Broncos wideout Jerry Jeudy. The interaction apparently did not go well and left the NFL Network analyst inclined to blast the 2020 first-round pick during the NFL Network pregame show. 
According to Smith, he used the term “JAG” – “just a guy” – to describe Jeudy on his “Cut To It” podcast. Trying to explain himself and wish Jeudy luck from the sideline set on Thursday, Smith said Jeudy had no interest, and apparently responded: “(Expletive), I don’t mess with you.” 
“I hope today that you actually show up in a way like you haven’t since they drafted you,” Smith said on air. 
Smith wasn’t done: “When teams call me and ask should they trade for Jerry Jeudy, I will say no. Because he is mentally unable to handle constructive criticism from people who watch specifically can he be a wide receiver? He can be a wide receiver. Tier 3.”
— Chris Bumbaca
Frank Clark’s tenure with the Broncos appears to be nearing an end. 
According to multiple reports, Denver will try to trade Clark before this month’s trade deadline. Clark is inactive for the matchup against the Chiefs – meaning he won’t face his former team in the AFC West contest – and has played in just two games (36 snaps) since signing with the Broncos this past offseason. NFL Network reported Clark and the Broncos reworked his contract to facilitate a potential trade. 
Clark spent the first four seasons of his career with the Seattle Seahawks before being acquired by the Chiefs ahead of the 2019 campaign. He won two Super Bowls with Kansas City and went to three straight Pro Bowls from 2019-21. 
Denver moved on from another veteran pass rusher, Randy Gregory, last week and sent him to the San Francisco 49ers for late-round draft compensation.

Tyler Dragon: Chiefs 28, Broncos 16
The Broncos are a mess and on the brink of a fire sale. Denver has very little chance against the defending Super Bowl champions. The Chiefs have won four in a row since losing their season opener. Kansas City surprisingly has a top-10 defense and their wide receivers are slowly improving. Patrick Mahomes targeted Rashee Rice, Kadarius Toney and Justyn Ross 15 times in Week 5.
Victoria Hernandez: Chiefs 30, Broncos 17
Are Patrick Mahomes and company the same team as last year? No. But the Broncos haven't shown anything that would make them competitive this year in the lopsided "rivalry." Last week, Sean Payton got served a slice of humble pie and a short turnaround doesn't help his cause.
Safid Deen: Chiefs 27, Broncos 17
Travis Kelce could be limited by an ankle injury, but Patrick Mahomes needs to get his other playmakers involved if Kansas City is going to repeat as champs. I like the Chiefs at home against the Broncos, who feel like a dysfunctional bunch during their 1-4 start under Sean Payton. 
The Chiefs entered Thursday as 10.5-point favorites, according to BetMGM NFL odds.
Inside Amazon's quest to create unique pregame and postgame shows around "Thursday Night Football."
There’s no love lost between Denver Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy and NFL Network analyst Steve Smith.
Smith, a five-time Pro Bowl selection during his playing career, claimed that he and Jeudy had a pregame confrontation that stemmed from a comment the retired wide receiver made about the Broncos player on his podcast.
“On my podcast I talked about guys that maybe have not showed up in a way,” Smith said on NFL Network before the Broncos and Chiefs kicked off Thursday night. “The word that I’ve used to describe him in the past was a J.A.G. — just a guy. When I saw him, he’s playing well. I wanted to say to him face to face, ‘hey, I know I’ve said some things in the past. I probably shouldn’t have and I’m sorry.’ That’s what I wanted to say to him. His response was, ‘(racial slur), I don’t mess with you.’ And it was a curse word. So I was like, ‘all right.’ And then he repeated it.”
Smith went on to deliver some not-so-subtle jabs.
“I’m sorry that I said you were a J.A.G., just a guy. Who’s an average wide receiver who they used a first-round pick on that isn’t doing anything," Smith said. "I hope today that you actually show up in a way that you haven’t showed up in the last couple years since they drafted you. So if you ever have a problem with Agent 89, I’m sorry, for saying that you’re an average wide receiver that they will eventually move on (from).”

Jeudy was seen on camera walking behind Smith’s live shot, but the retired wide receiver took the high road.
“When I used to play, I would engage and I love that. But right now, I’m 44 years old. I don’t need to have this drama and I also don’t need to have any problems on the sideline for me doing something that will jeopardize not just me but him,” Smith continued. “One of the biggest problems we have in the media, especially as a young Black man, sometimes is Black-on-Black crime. I’m not gonna participate in that. I’m not gonna participate where the national media can see two African American men acting like we don’t got no sense. He didn’t like what I said and that’s fine. I wanted to talk to him. He didn’t like it, so we move on.”
In 16 NFL seasons, Smith was selected to five Pro Bowls and was named a first team All-Pro twice. He was the NFL receiving yards leader and Comeback Player of the Year in 2005. The former Carolina Panthers and Baltimore Ravens wide receiver finished with 1,031 catches, 14,731 receiving yards and 81 touchdowns in 219 career games.
The Broncos selected Jeudy No. 15 overall in the 2020 NFL draft. He has 174 catches, 2,503 receiving yards and nine touchdowns in 45 career games. He’s never made a Pro Bowl or All-Pro team.
A St. Louis youth football coach is recovering from surgery after being shot four times by a disgruntled parent that was allegedly upset over his son's playing time, the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department confirmed to USA TODAY Sports.
Authorities said Shaquille Latimore, 30, is in critical, but stable condition after he was gunned down by Daryl Clemmons, 43, at a park in North St. Louis during the team's football practice Tuesday evening. The shooting followed an argument between the two.
"I didn't see his gun until it was already too late," Latimore, an assistant coach and defensive coordinator for the St. Louis BadBoyz, a city recreational league team comprised of children ages 9 and 10, told the St. Louis Dispatch from his hospital bed. "I ran, and he shot me in the back. I fell and he shot me a couple more times."
No one else, including the children that witnessed the shooting, was injured. Clemmons turned himself in to police and faces charges of first-degree assault and armed criminal action. He remains in custody.

Latimore told police that the confrontation with Clemmons started because he was "upset with (Latimore) for not starting his son," according to a St. Louis Circuit Attorney's Office probable cause statement obtained by The Associated Press.
"After every game, he would try to critique me," Latimore said. "After he shot me, was like … 'I told you I was going to pop your (expletive) … I heard people running and screaming."
Latimore was shot in the back, leg, arm and abdomen, with some bullets injuring some of his internal organs. His mother, SeMiko Latimore, told the Dispatch that her son is "thankful to be alive" after the "senseless shooting."
"I'm going to be OK," Latimore said. "It's more psychological than anything else."
This is the latest incident of harassment and acts of violence toward youth coaches and umpires. In May, a Florida man was arrested for sucker-punching an umpire at his son's baseball game. Last year, a youth softball umpire in Mississippi was punched in the face by a mom.
Scarlett Johansson is praising Pamela Anderson's "powerful" no-makeup look at Paris Fashion Week.
Anderson, 56, went bare-faced to the star-studded event earlier this month, sparking much conversation and praise, including from the "Black Widow" star. In an interview published Wednesday, Johansson, 38, told PopSugar the move was a "powerful message."
"I think it is definitely different to see somebody that's in the public eye, a woman in the public eye, go to a fashion show or big event with no makeup on," she said of the "Baywatch" star. "It's just very different from what we're used to."
"It's powerful for women to see other women rejecting standard beauty norms," Johansson continued.
The "Marriage Story" actress echoed comments Jamie Lee Curtis shared about the look earlier this month.
"THE NATURAL BEAUTY REVOLUTION HAS OFFICIALLY BEGUN!" Curtis wrote on Instagram, tagging Anderson. "This woman showed up and claimed her seat at the table with nothing on her face. I am so impressed and floored by this act of courage and rebellion."
Scarlett Johanssonloved playing a 'sociopath' in 'Asteroid City': Must be 'convenient!'
Anderson opened up about not wearing makeup to Paris Fashion Week events in an interview with Vogue France, saying she doesn't "want to compete with the clothes."
“I'm not into the makeup look right now," she added. "My mom always told me, 'At some point in your life, you’re not going to want to wear makeup on your skin,' and she’s right. You kind of have to challenge beauty sometimes."
Anderson said she hopes that by not wearing makeup she can help model the multitude of ways women can express themselves. "I'm not trying to be the prettiest girl in the room," she said. "I feel like it's just freedom. It's a relief."
Anderson has joined the ranks of celebrity women embracing no-makeup looks or aging naturally, including Justine Bateman, Kelly Ripa, and Alicia Keys.

Former president and current criminal defendant Donald Trump, the front-runner in the GOP presidential primary, is getting worse.
I realize that’s a mighty high bar for him to clear, but he’s doing it, each day showing independent voters and Republicans who still value sane leadership why he should never be allowed within 10 square miles of the White House.
In the wake of the hideous Hamas attack on Israel, with American lawmakers and both sides of the aisle pledging full support for our ally, Trump’s political instincts told him to slam Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and say: “Israel was not prepared.”
Trump then praised the terrorist organization Hezbollah, which on Wednesday was attacking Israel along its northern border. 
“You know, Hezbollah is very smart,” Trump said. “They’re all very smart.”
MAGA loyalists’ minds won’t be changed by anything, but those voters also won’t be enough, should Trump win the GOP nomination, to get him back into office. He’ll need to win over independents and even some moderate Republicans who put country over party while making headway with the ever-growing number of Generation Z voters who, based on recent elections, broadly reject Trump's MAGA movement.
How is he going to do all that when he's running around the country insulting an ally reeling from an unspeakable terror attack and generally sounding like his brain has turned to oatmeal?
After horrific Hamas attack on Israel,Biden acts presidential while Republicans act like fools.
Consider an assortment of baffling/disturbing comments Trump has made in speeches and on social media just in recent weeks.
He has repeatedly misidentified President Joe Biden as former President Barack Obama, recently saying at a rally “you take a look at Obama and look at some of the things he’s done” and then, in an interview this week about Biden’s response to the attack on Israel, saying, “It’s all coming through Iran, and Obama, he doesn’t want to talk about it. ... He doesn’t even mention them in a statement.”
The Fox News interviewer had to correct him afterward.
In another recent interview, Trump said: “We have the worst education almost in the large world, the world that people know about.” As opposed to the large world people don’t know about?
He said at a rally that the U.S. Capitol “looks like sh-t.”
Referring to Jeb Bush, Trump said: “He got us into the Middle East. How did that work out?” It was President George W. Bush who “got us into the Middle East.”
In a Sept. 15 speech in Washington, D.C., Trump suggested Biden will lead America into World War II, which ended in 1945: “We have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president in the history of our country, who is cognitively impaired, in no condition to lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war. Just think of it, we would be in World War II very quickly if we’re going to be relying on this man.”
When questioning someone’s lucidity, it’s generally best to sound lucid yourself.
Late last month at a rally, Trump mocked Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her husband, who was brutally attacked and beaten in their home last year.
“We’ll stand up to crazy Nancy Pelosi, who ruined San Francisco – how’s her husband doing, anybody know?” Trump said as the crowd laughed. “And she’s against building a wall at our border, even though she has a wall around her house – which obviously didn’t do a very good job.” 
Biden is too old.And so is Trump. As a Gen Z voter, I want younger candidates.
Speaking of immigrants, Trump said in an interview earlier this month: “It is a very sad thing for our country. It’s poisoning the blood of our country.”
That language mirrors lines in Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” and is in line with the way white supremacists discuss immigrants.
Trump has said recently that forest fires could be prevented “if you dampen your forests.”
He said anyone who robs a store should be shot – “If you rob a store you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store. Shot!”
And in a Florida speech this week, he went on this rant (I’ve used all-caps and phonetic spelling to illustrate the pronunciation of words he loudly emphasized): “Instead of keeping terrorists and terrorist sympathizers out of America, the Biden administration is inviting them in. You know why, because he’s got a boss. Who’s his boss? Barack HOO-SANE Obama. Barack Hoo-sane Obama. You remember the great Rush Limbaugh, Barack Hoo-SANE Obama. He’d go, Barack Hoo-SANE Obama.”
Petty criticism of Israel (Trump remains mad at Netanyahu because the prime minister accepted that Biden won the 2020 election), violent rhetoric, mixing up the names of political rivals, mocking an attack on a lawmaker’s spouse and generally sounding like the town drunk slouched at the end of the bar airing conspiratorial grievances. And that’s only a small sample of Trump’s madness over the past few weeks.
Setting aside his two impeachments, his incitement of an attack on the U.S. Capitol, his election denialism and the 91 state and federal felony charges he faces, I have to ask independents and on-the-fence Republicans alike: Would you actually vote for that mess? Is that really the best the Republican Party can offer America and the world?
People will keep taking swipes at Biden’s age, though Trump is only three years younger. But if you listen and pay attention to the former president, you’ll see a profoundly unhinged man teetering on a full separation from reality.
The ham has slipped off his sandwich. It’s time to stop pretending otherwise.

MADISON, Wisc. — The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Assembly passed legislation on Thursday banning gender-affirming care for minors and barring transgender athletes from competing in sports at the high school and college levels.
The three transgender-related bills were approved in a 63-35 vote, with all Democrats voting against the measures and nearly all Republicans voting for the measures. Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has vowed to veto the legislation.
"We continue to see harmful anti-LGBTQ rhetoric in Wisconsin—rhetoric that emboldens hate and violence and that we know only hurts our kids who are already facing significant mental health challenges," Evers said on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday. "We’re going to stop these attacks, and we’re going to do it together."
Two of the bills would prohibit transgender girls and women from participating in high school and college sports teams. Instead, students would have to play on teams that match the gender they were assigned at birth.
The third bill would bar doctors from providing gender-transition treatment to minors, such as performing gender-affirming surgery or providing hormones and puberty blockers.
The bills are moving quickly, hitting the Assembly floor a week after heated public hearings drew hundreds to the state Capitol. The legislation now moves on to the Republican-controlled state Senate. If it passes then the package will head to Evers' desk.
The highly contentious legislation comes amid a barrage of bills targeting the LGBTQ+ community, including limiting the rights of transgender youths, across the United States. Republican lawmakers have faced intense pushback and criticism from the LGBTQ+ community along with advocates, prompting discrimination lawsuits in many states.
Religion vs. LGBTQ+ rights:Supreme Court weighs 'conversion therapy' bans for minors
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos told reporters the Assembly is pursuing the legislation because Republican lawmakers "think they're the right thing to do for Wisconsin" and suggested the opinions of medical experts will change. Vos also likened gender-affirming surgery to lobotomies ahead of the debate on Thursday.
"If you go back in history, the way to treat mental illness 50 to 100 years ago was a lobotomy. And at the time, that was settled science. That was just the way it was supposed to be," Vos said. "We can go back to example after example after example where the human mind has been opened to say there are different ways of doing things and it shouldn’t necessarily be a one-size-fits-all solution because we have settled science.”
Democrats pushed back on Vos' rhetoric during an Assembly floor session Thursday and said allowing transgender athletes to compete in sports that match their gender fosters acceptance and belonging.
"The fact that legislators are creating an environment that pushes specific groups of children out of existence and sports teams in service to a political agenda is objectively terrible, it's discriminatory and it's cruel," said Wisconsin State Rep. Lee Snodgrass.
At the Capitol hearings, advocates representing the LGBTQ+ community testified that the proposals would harm transgender and nonbinary youth in Wisconsin, and worsen the mental health challenges and stigma they face.
Republicans argued the bills would ensure competitiveness in women's sports and prevent transgender individuals from regretting medical procedures — though reviews of research find regretting a gender transition is uncommon. GOP lawmakers made similar remarks during Thursday's floor session.
"Men have major physical advantages. They're bigger, they're stronger, they're faster," said Wisconsin State Rep. Joel Kitchens. "Title IX was created so that women can have the same access to the same advantages, the same character building that takes place [in sports] that men always have experienced."
In a letter circulated last week, Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Instruction Jill Underly cited data from the state's 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey that found more than half of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide and nearly a quarter attempted to take their own life.
"Let’s show respect to every single individual in the state, let’s stop interfering with their access to the medical care that they need," Wisconsin Rep. Lisa Subeck said earlier this week before voting against one of the bills in committee. "It’s time to stop pretending that politicians know better than physicians and know better than the experts. We don’t."
NYPD transgender sensitivity lawsuit:New York Civil Liberties Union sues NYPD for records on transgender sensitivity training
Several groups in Wisconsin have registered in opposition to the legislation, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Medical College of Wisconsin, the American Pediatrics Academy’s Wisconsin chapter and the Wisconsin School Social Workers Association.
The Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association (WIAA) also opposes the ban on transgender girls and women from competing in sports designated for women. And University of Wisconsin-Madison officials previously warned that the university's teams would be out of compliance with NCAA policies if the legislation is enacted. 
The WIAA's current policy for transgender participation in sports requires transgender athletes to undergo hormone therapy before they can play on the teams of their choice. The association's policy is derived from existing policies for transgender athletes from the NCAA.
Since 2022, GOP legislators have introduced dozens of bills aimed to prevent transgender youth from participating in school sports that are consistent with their gender identity, according to LGBTQ+ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign.
"By the end of the 2022 legislative session, a record 17 bills attacking transgender and non-binary children passed into law. 19 states exclude transgender athletes in school sports," the advocacy group said in a news release Thursday.
And at least 22 states have passed laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors.
Research has shown that gender-affirming surgery for minors is rare. According to a study published in August, fewer than 3,700 surgeries were performed in the United States on patients ages 12 to 18 from 2016 through 2019.
Experts have also said that receiving gender-affirming care — the social, psychological and medical support that people receive when their gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth — is crucial in supporting mental health for transgender people.

A Georgia-based firm known for collecting artifacts from the site of the Titanic is following OceanGate's lead by suspending future trips to the ship's wreckage after the company's director died on the Titan submersible that imploded and killed five people on a similar voyage.
The move comes after the U.S. Government argued the group's previously planned expedition to collect artifacts from the wreckage, including the famous Marconi wireless telegraph unit that was on board, would violate federal law and a federal pact with Great Britain requiring the Titanic site to be treated as a gravesite.
In the latest development in the case, on Thursday afternoon the US cancelled a hearing that was scheduled for Friday.
RMS Titanic Inc. previously planned to enter the Titanic's severed hull in May 2024 with late director Paul-Henri Nargeolet in charge, according to court records. The company and the federal government have been entangled in a legal battle in the U.S. District Court in Norfolk, Virginia since August.
Court records filed by a law firm representing the company in a U.S. District Court on Wednesday show it changed its plans from collecting artifacts to only conducting "unmanned imaging and survey work at this time," according to the Associated Press. Jessica Sanders, the CEO of RMS Titanic Inc., supported those claims in a statement, AP reported.
The company owns the salvage rights to the property.
“Out of respect for P.H. Nargeolet and his family, and the other four people who perished so recently at the site, and their families, the company has decided that artifact recovery would not be appropriate at this time,” a law firm representing the company wrote, according to the AP.
On June 16, OceanGate Expeditions, a privately-owned ocean tourism company, led a voyage of five people from St. John's in Newfoundland, Canada to the depths of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean in a 22-foot submersible called The Titan.
The submersible was built with titanium and filament-wound carbon fiber, according to the company's website, which are unconventional materials for deep-sea vehicles.
About one hour and 45 minutes after the boat launched, a support ship monitoring the vessel lost all communication with the submersible.
After connection was lost, the US Coast Guard led an urgent race to find the men before the oxygen tanks on the vessel ran dry. Search and rescue teams scoured the Atlantic Ocean to find the submersible.
Days later, the Coast Guard found the debris of The Titan on the ocean floor about 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic. They ultimately determined the Titan imploded on its journey.
Rear Admiral John Mauger of the U.S. Coast Guard said the debris was “consistent with catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber" at a news conference.
Shortly after, OceanGate announced that all aboard The Titan had died.
There were four men and a teenager on board, including Nargeolet, OceanGate's CEO Stockton Rush, British billionaire explorer Hamish Harding and a father and son from one of Pakistan’s most prominent families, Shahzada Dawood and Suleman Dawood.
"This is a very sad time for the entire explorer community, and for each of the family members of those lost at sea,” the company wrote.
Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, was the director of RMS Titanic Inc,, an affiliate of Experimental Media Group, which creates and tours world-class exhibitions, when he took the voyage to the wreckage with OceanGate in June.
He was a French maritime and known for his "impressive and tenured history with Titanic," according to his biography on the company's website.
"Widely considered the leading authority on the wreck site, P.H. has led several expeditions to Titanic, completed 37 dives in the submersible himself, and supervised the recovery of 5,000 artifacts, including the recovery of the “big piece” a 20-ton section of Titanic’s hull (now on display in Las Vegas)," the biography reads.
A memorial for Nargeolet on the website's homepage reads: "In loving memory of PH Nargeolet: Always in our hearts and thoughts. A true explorer of his time."
In court filings, attorneys for RMS Titanic Inc. said during the planned trip, the company "may recover free-standing objects inside the wreck" in addition to items in the outer debris.
Those could have included “objects from inside the Marconi room, but only if such objects are not affixed to the wreck itself."
The Marconi room holds the famous Marconi wireless telegraphic machine, named after its inventor Guglielmo Marconi. The senior wireless operator Jack Phillips used the device to send radio messages in Morse code for help as the Titanic collided with an iceberg on April 15, 1912, according to the ScienceMuseum. Harold Cottam, an operator on a Cunard Line passenger steamship named the Carpathia, received the Philiip's messages and traveled 60 miles on the steamship to the Titanic. More than 700 survivors on lifeboats boarded the ship and sailed to New York City.
A U.S. District judge previously granted the company permission to venture in a submersible to obtain the artifact, saying that it could "contribute to the legacy left by the indelible loss of the Titanic, those who survived, and those who gave their lives in the sinking," according to the AP.
The judge Rebecca Beach Smith said in 2020 it could soon be lost to decay. The US government also challenged RMS Titanic's expedition then, and the company cancelled its trips due to the pandemic, the AP reported.
The company didn't only cancel its May 2024 trip to the Titanic.
In court filings, it said it would halt all trips until “further investigation takes place regarding the cause of the (OceanGate) tragedy," the Associated Press reported.
OceanGate also suspended its operations, including voyages to the Titanic, the company said in June.

Max Gruver spent the early morning hours of Sept. 14, 2017, heavily intoxicated and passed out on a couch inside the Phi Delta Theta chapter house at Louisiana State University.
He had been forced to repeatedly chug 190-proof Diesel liquor in a hazing ritual called “Bible Study,” during which pledges are quizzed on fraternity facts. The incident caused Gruver, a freshman majoring in political communications, to inhale his own vomit into his lungs.
By the time fraternity members finally sought medical aid the next morning, Gruver’s pulse was weak and they couldn’t tell if he was breathing. Gruver’s blood alcohol level was .495, more than six times Louisiana’s legal driving limit, when he died from what an autopsy concluded was “acute alcohol intoxication with aspiration.” He was 18.
As college students begin a new semester this fall, many will participate in rituals to bring in new members of a fraternity or sorority, a sports team or other club. Sometimes, the initiations involve heavy alcohol use or physical assaults. Although awareness of hazing and its dangers has grown significantly, it still happens.
In June, New Mexico State University agreed to pay $8 million to settle a lawsuit over hazing allegations in the men’s basketball program. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she will be introducing anti-hazing and abuse legislation next year. In July, Northwestern University fired its head football coach after an investigation found widespread hazing on the team. And Boston College suspended its swim and dive team this month following hazing allegations.
At least 44 states and the District of Columbia have anti-hazing laws in place, most recently Ohio in 2021 and Pennsylvania in 2018. Kentucky and Washington strengthened their laws this past legislative session. Six states − Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and Wyoming − have none, according to StopHazing, an anti-hazing advocacy and research organization.
But state anti-hazing laws, most of which were approved in the past 15 years, differ in their definitions and the criminal penalties they impose. Depending on the state, participating in hazing activities may result in a fine, misdemeanor charge or a felony charge if the hazing results in serious bodily harm or death.
Some experts and anti-hazing advocates say the penalties in some states aren’t harsh enough to deter organizations from participating in hazing. And even in states that have laws, incidents like the one that left Max Gruver dead don’t necessarily lead to serious criminal charges.
Supreme Court says no:LSU can't claim immunity from lawsuit in death of fraternity pledge
Four former LSU students and ex-members of Phi Delta Theta were indicted in connection with Gruver’s death. Three of them faced misdemeanor hazing charges, while the fourth faced a felony charge of negligent homicide. The university also banned Phi Delta Theta from its campus until at least 2033.
Gruver’s parents – Rae Ann and Stephen Gruver – pressed for stiffer penalties for hazing, prompting Louisiana to enact the Max Gruver Act in 2018, which made hazing that results in serious bodily harm or death a felony; introduced a statewide definition of hazing; and mandated that hazing incidents and disciplinary actions taken against members of student groups be reported to the respective host institutions.
“It’s unfortunate that with the death of our son – it took that to get Louisiana to change their laws,” Stephen Gruver told Stateline. “It’s something that can be prevented; this never should have happened to our son.”
Since then, the Gruvers, along with parents of other hazing victims, have advocated for stricter state and federal penalties for hazing and greater transparency when such incidents occur.
“If you don't have a strong enough law, it’s not a deterrent for these kids and they’re just going to keep on being bad actors because they just don’t care,” Stephen Gruver said.
Hazing, a practice rooted in tradition and camaraderie, has long been a controversial and pervasive issue on college campuses. While hazing incidents have garnered significant national attention over the past decade, the earliest account of hazing is believed to date back to the fourth century – when Plato observed young boys playing “practical jokes” on other students in school, according to a book written by journalist and anti-hazing advocate Hank Nuwer. The first anti-hazing law in the United States was enacted in New York in 1894.
In the U.S., more than 280 people allegedly have died due to hazing since 1838, according to the U.S. Hazing Deaths Database. The database is maintained by Nuwer. Hazing deaths are not currently tracked by any U.S. government entity.
In 2017, the year of Gruver’s death, at least six other young adults also died a result of alleged hazing activities. Between 2018 and 2021, at least 23 people allegedly died due to hazing activities. No hazing deaths were reported in 2022.
According to a 2008 study by two University of Maine professors, more than half of college students involved with student organizations experience hazing, which often involves “alcohol consumption, humiliation, isolation, sleep-deprivation, and sex acts.” The study, which is considered the most comprehensive analysis of hazing in the United States, also found that about 47% of students come to college having already experienced hazing.
Frats slow to change:Young men have died in fraternities every year for 2 decades
“Hazing is prevalent throughout society. It’s not just a college thing. It’s really seen anywhere that there’s a differing power dynamic,” Todd Shelton, the executive director of the Hazing Prevention Network, told Stateline. Hazing appears in settings such as high schools, other student groups, the military and professional workplaces.
In many states, hazing carries misdemeanor charges – a fact that some advocates argue does little to effectively deter hazing incidents.
“Where hazing is a minor misdemeanor, it’s not taken seriously by law enforcement because it’s not worth the effort to prosecute,” Shelton said. “One of the biggest hurdles is getting the penalty or statute to match the seriousness of the crime.”
In Kentucky, Lofton’s Law was signed into law in March, increasing the penalty for hazing that leads to death or serious physical injury to a Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. Reckless participation in hazing can result in a misdemeanor.
And in Washington state, the Sam Martinez Stop Hazing Law, which was passed unanimously and signed into law in May, makes hazing a gross misdemeanor instead of a misdemeanor; if the hazing results in substantial bodily harm, it rises to a felony. The law bumps up penalties for hazing from a maximum of 90 days to up to a year – and up to five years for the felony charge.
Washington became the 15th state to elevate hazing to a felony if it causes severe injury or death.
“For the first time we’re talking about hazing in a very real way. There’s been a culture of secrecy, in my view, of hazing for many, many years,” Rep. Mari Leavitt, a Democrat who wrote the bill, said in an interview with Stateline. “Students will recognize that there is a pretty significant consequence for choosing to behave in these barbaric activities and it can change the trajectory of their lives.”
The new law follows the passage of Sam’s Law in 2022, named after the same student, which updated the definition of hazing and required universities and colleges, as well as fraternity and sorority chapters, to make hazing investigation records public.
“The more that people are aware, and willing to talk about it and willing to report what they see, that will start to change that culture of secrecy to something that holds people accountable and also is transparent in terms of what’s happening across states,” Leavitt said.
In 15 states, a major weakness in the anti-hazing law, according to StopHazing, is the absence of a “consent clause,” which asserts that an individual’s willingness to participate in potentially hazardous actions – as when a student agrees to a certain activity – does not protect those involved from hazing charges. Some anti-hazing laws explicitly spell out that consent is not a defense.
“The consent clause … is really important in terms of documenting hazing and having policy be really effective,” said Elizabeth Allan, the principal of StopHazing and a professor of higher education at the University of Maine. Allan co-wrote the 2008 national study on hazing.
Advocacy groups also have been pushing for national anti-hazing legislation to establish uniform definitions and penalties.
Proposed federal legislation, originally known as the Report and Educate About Campus Hazing Act, or REACH Act, was initially introduced in Congress in 2021. This year, it is set to be reintroduced under a new name, the Stop Campus Hazing Act. The legislation encompasses a range of transparency and prevention measures, including mandatory public reporting of hazing incidents and the implementation of comprehensive prevention programs.
“Hazing is often underreported, underrecognized and it’s really not being taken as seriously as it should be given the harmful impact that it has on individuals and communities,” said Jessica Mertz, the executive director of the Clery Center, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting campus safety.
Among fraternities and sororities, discussions around cracking down on hazing have gained momentum. Still, critics argue that most state anti-hazing laws should impose tougher penalties on national Greek life organizations and institutions, rather than individuals.
“As a founding member of the Anti-Hazing Coalition, the North American Interfraternity Conference and our member fraternities advocate for stronger federal and state hazing laws to increase criminal penalties and provide greater transparency to hold individuals accountable when found to be involved in hazing,” Judson Horras, CEO of the North American Interfraternity Conference, said in a statement.
“While in this partnership, we have seen stronger state laws passed in over a dozen states and are encouraged by the introduction of the bipartisan Stop Campus Hazing Act in the 118th Congress last week,” the statement said.
A 2020 paper by a Penn State University professor and published in the Journal of College and University Law underscores this argument. Law professor Justin J. Swofford argues that for legislation to be most effective in deterring future hazing injuries and deaths, there must be greater criminal and civil penalties imposed on both schools and fraternities.
However, some voices within the community question whether genuine change is achievable. Lucy Taylor, who disaffiliated from Alpha Phi at the University of Maryland and hosts “SNAPPED,” a podcast exploring Greek life, suggests that change within the organizations can often appear performative.
These initiatives may encompass disciplinary committees, mandatory anti-hazing programs or even the hiring of security teams, Taylor said.
“They make it seem like change is happening, but those things that they’re doing to create change don't actually have any power. If they wanted hazing to be gone, it would have been gone years ago,” Taylor said. “They don’t do anything or they don’t do what they’re intended to do, and the hazing culture just becomes even more secret.
“The more secret it becomes, the worse it gets.”
The drama burned so hot in the Bachelor Mansion that it's a small miracle Gerry Turner didn't pull the fire alarm during Thursday's third episode of "The Golden Bachelor."
Former "Bachelorette" Kaitlyn Bristowe stopped by to co-host a wild talent show that served as a group date, one contestant sizzled during a romantic dinner with the smitten Gerry, only to tearfully go home later for personal reasons, and two contestants exited after failing to receive roses from Gerry in a tense ceremony.
But all of that is ho-hum compared to the Bravo-esque intrigue that blew up in the household of female contestants who had been remarkably cordial through the first two episodes.
It's so on. Here's what happened.
With a Gerry solo-date prize on the line, the talent show brought some wild moments, including Leslie's provocative musical frolic that turned into a Gerry lap dance. This is, after all, the woman who claims Prince was her onetime beau, who wrote "Sexy Dancer" after he was inspired by her moves.
"She got a little dirty there, a little sexy there at the end," a mostly admiring Susan said in a redundant debriefing to the camera.
But the tense Joan, who nervously claimed she didn't have any talent, killed it reading her poem about meeting Gerry, titled "I Just Hope I Don't Vomit on Your Shoes." The simple verse got big laughs but also touched Gerry, who welled up for the episode's first tears. He picked Joan as the talent-show winner.
The two connected on their dinner date, which ended with Gerry giving Joan a rose, and a deep kiss.
And yet the budding passion was all for naught, as Joan tearfully exited "The Golden Bachelor" the next day. Joan received news that her daughter, who underwent a difficult C-section birth, required her mother's love and intervention in the real world. Weeping Gerry was devastated for, like, 30 seconds of TV time after Joan broke the news. Then it was time to move on.
Ellen was chosen for a dream date, with her choice of fancy frocks complemented by Champagne, and Gerry gifted her Neil Lane earrings he most surely didn't buy. They soared in a hot air balloon, and Gerry presented her with a rose before busting another signature move.
"Have you ever been kissed at 100 feet?" he asked before the big balloon sunset smooch. She has now! Joan who? The circle of "Golden Bachelor" life.
Enter Kathy, who has shown previous potential to shake things up as the once collegial season's much-needed vampishly controversial character. That promise finally became reality after Kathy conjured up a show-shaking feud with onetime confidante Theresa. Yes, Theresa. The Nice One.
Kathy was set off by Theresa's allegedly overly boastful talk about her deep connection to Gerry after last week's solo date. Actual discussion video footage suggests that Theresa was just baring her heart to a friend.
But Kathy was off, dissing Theresa behind her back, then taking more imagined offense before the women met Gerry wearing their evening gowns. It was a true reality show "Dynasty" moment.
"Theresa, you can tell that her eyes are saying, 'Yeah, you don't have a chance,'" Kathy fumed in a camera confession. "I don't like it."
Poor old Gerry was oblivious to the mansion intrigue, falling for Kathy's tears during a one-on-one meeting during which she subtly tried to throw Theresa under the bus.
"I think sometimes what you think you see is not what is," Theresa stammered in a Theresa-bashing effort that flew over Gerry's head. His face looked like a golden retriever listening to French.
Gerry shockingly presented Kathy with a rose, which is all that Kathy really ― I mean really ― wanted.
"This is crazy," Theresa lamented to the camera as she pieced together the feud she never saw coming. She cried and cried again in Gerry's hokily comforting arms without mentioning her clear antagonist.
Theresa even did the healthy thing by speaking to Kathy, who finally revealed her anger while maintaining her stubborn indignation. This dark genie is not going back into the bottle.
If Theresa can take one bit of solace from the emotionally bruising week, it's that Gerry gave her the last rose. So this drama will last another "Golden Bachelor" week. At least. And prospects for a TV feud-escalation look very promising.
Edith and Christina, who stayed out of the fray this week, will not go on this journey. They both went home.

It's not often that solar eclipses race across our skies, the moon blotting out the sun to usher in either a wave of darkness or captivating rings of fire such as what will occur Saturday.
Years and years pass between these spectacular celestial events, that last of which occurred in 2017 when a total eclipse transformed the afternoon American skies seemingly into dusk. It's been even longer since we've seen an annular solar eclipse such as the one that will on Saturday travel in the U.S. from the coast of Oregon to the Texas Gulf Coast.
The phenomenon is not only rare, but undeniably beautiful.
That's why astronomers say it's no surprise that the promise of catching a glimpse of such a dazzling spectacle — whether it be a complete eclipse or only a partial one — always manages to fascinate us.
"I think humans have a deep connection with the night sky," Cameron Hummels, director of astrophysics outreach at the California Institute of Technology, told USA TODAY. "Astronomical events like eclipses, meteor showers, and the northern lights are a way in which they can experience it first hand."
Need solar eclipse glasses?Where to find them and why you need them
Millions of Americans have now long been eagerly awaiting what will be their only chance until 2039 to catch a glimpse of the so-called "ring of fire" emanating around the moon as it partially eclipses the sun.
Americans across the county will flock this weekend to eclipse watch parties at libraries, national parks and other venues to catch a glimpse of the phenomenon. That even includes places without a view of the the annular eclipse itself, which occurs when the moon passes in front of the sun at the farthest point of its orbit from Earth.
Because the moon appears too small to completely block the sun, it instead appears as a small disc in front of the larger, brighter star, which causes a halo effect that resembles the ring of fire.
It's a process scientists have long understood, but it hasn't diminished the excitement that bubbles up anytime an eclipse approaches. Many astronomers like Christopher Sirola from the University of Southern Mississippi even view eclipses as an opportunity to harness public captivation to educate about the science behind the phenomenon.
"Solar eclipses are very predictable, but their regularities are not obvious," Sirola said. "Such events are awesome, especially total solar eclipses."
Roadtripping and stargazing:Top 15 roadtrips in the US and solar eclipse activities at National Parks
We may think of astronomers and astrophysicists as studious and objective observers of the skies, but solar eclipses are equally exciting for them.
And while much of that eager anticipation is purely for the celestial light show that will be on display, there's an academic reason as well.
Describing eclipses as "a cosmic masterpiece," Elsayed Talaat of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told USA TODAY that the celestial events afford scientists an opportunity to study the sun much closer than normal.
Taking photos of the eclipse:Here's what to know about viewing and capturing the solar eclipse with your cellphone camera
Total solar eclipses in particular, such as the one that will overtake a large swath of the country in April, allow for scientists to test and improve human understanding of the laws of physics, primarily those of the sun. Veiled by the massive star's bright light, the sun's outermost layer known as the corona becomes visible during a total eclipse, allowing astronomers to conduct observations normally impossible, said Talaat, director of NOAA's Office of Space Weather Observations.
The corona to this day remains shrouded in mystery, as Talaat said scientists are unsure of just why the outermost layer is able to reach a temperature of 1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit compared to the 10,000 degrees measured on the surface of the sun itself.
Scientists at NOAA use a telescopic device called a coronagraph to replicate the effects of an eclipse by blocking out the direct light from the sun in order to measure a corona year-round without relying on the moon's orbit.
NOAA’s newest geostationary satellite will carry a coronagraph onboard when it launches for deep space next year, while a 2025 mission will also bring another device roughly 1 million miles away from earth to allow for unobstructed observations of the corona.
However, Talaat admits there's nothing like seeing an eclipse for yourself.
"It's very different to be able to see it with your own eyes from the ground; that's a very powerful experience for me," Talaat said. "It reminds me — it reminds us — that the sun is powerful in ways we don't fully understand or quite appreciate."

WASHINGTON – A giant chunk of marble at least two feet long crashed into an interior courtyard of the Supreme Court last year, according to an Associated Press report Friday.
No one was injured, though the courtyard is used regularly by the justices and their aides. Justice Elena Kagan and her law clerks had been in the courtyard earlier in the day, the AP reported, citing court employees.
It's not the first time such an incident has taken place at the Supreme Court. A basketball-sized chunk of marble fell off the building in 2005, landing on the court’s front marble steps. No one was injured in that incident.
A Supreme Court spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The courtyard is currently closed for renovation, the AP reported, work that had been planned before the marble fell.
Friday the 13th may be an unlucky day by many superstitious standards, but it has become known as a lucrative one in the ink industry.
Just as with pumpkins at Halloween and turkeys at Thanksgiving, tattoos have become the American symbol of a day that is otherwise associated with bad omens and avoiding black cats or breaking mirrors. Like any bit of folk wisdom, tracking down the origins behind the unlucky number 13 and the even more specifically Friday the 13th are difficult. Likewise, the proliferation of the cheap ink tradition carries its own shroud of mystery and uncertainty.
That said, the act of warding off bad luck by adorning your body with a "13" design or another piece of art is a much more recent cultural phenomena than triskaidekaphobia, or the fear of the number 13.
So, while historians continue to ponder the perhaps biblical, perhaps violent or even simply mathematic reasoning behind the Western aversion to Friday the 13th, those of us interested in tattoos can look at the more recent past to find out how, exactly, tattoos and the 13th became synonymous.
Unlucky 13:Friday the 13th is here: What to know about the day many people consider unlucky
In Western culture, Friday the 13th is associated with the idea of unluckiness. At least once a year, the Gregorian calendar sees the 13th day of the month falling on a Friday, though it can sometimes come three times in one year.
As with many superstitions and traditions, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact origin of the belief. Some historians say the number 13 originally became an "unlucky" number thanks to biblical references. Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus Christ, was the 13th guest at the Last Supper, for example.
Christ was likewise crucified on a Friday in the Bible, drawing an association between the day and catastrophe. Yet another theory dates back to 1307, when the French king gave orders on Friday the 13th to arrest hundreds of Knights Templar who were later executed.
No matter how it began, the number 13 has been synonymous with bad omens in Western culture for many years. Of course, the cult-classic horror movie franchise featuring Michael Myers hasn't helped since the 1980s.
What is Friday the 13th?Why people may be superstitious about the day
Friday the 13th has become something of a Black Friday for tattoo shops. Many shops run special promotions charging steeply discounted prices to get work done, often for a flat rate at or even under shop minimum (the minimum fee a shop will usually charge on a tattoo to cover the cost of the basic supplies and overhead).
The average hourly price most artists charge is between $100 to $200 plus, making these flash sales a great deal. While affordable predesigned flash tattoos and flash sales are not uncommon practices throughout the rest of the calendar year, Friday the 13th is the one day you can depend on finding a wealth of markdowns at multiple shops near you.
The ability to pick a shop, walk right in without an appointment and choose a fun design, then sit for a relatively short and easy piece that costs far less than usual attracts heavily tattooed people and newbies alike.
People with many tattoos use the day as a quick and affordable means to fill a small gap in their sleeve or add to their collection between big projects, while people new to tattoos can walk in and navigate a new experience that is already largely pre-planned. Of course, there's always the added bonus of having what has become something of a good luck charm to combat the bad vibes that apparently come with the number 13.
While some businesses see the day as an opportunity to make connections, get more people in the door and more eyes on their work, other artists choose not to participate due to what they see as an undervaluing of their labor thanks to low pay and long days of churning out many copies of cheap, unoriginal art.
The modern model for Friday the 13th as a tattoo holiday is often credited back to co-owner of Elm Street Tattoo in Dallas Oliver Peck, who you may recognize from TV show "Ink Master" and his brief marriage to Kat Von D (he has since been remove from the show due to a blackface controversy).
Peck previously told Vice that he "definitely wasn't the first person to do it," saying he drew some inspiration from fellow artist Dave Lum's Halloween specials, but that he did "make it an event." He threw his first major Friday the 13th function in 1995 at the now-defunct Pair O' Dice in Dallas, a marathon session of tattooing the number "13" on as many people as possible in a 24-hour period.
His swing at creating his own tradition caught on, as he and his co-workers began hosting these 24-hour tattoathons each year, at one point winning a spot in Guinness Book of World Records for tattooing the number 13 on 415 people in 24 hours on Friday, June 13, 2008. While many tattoos done on this day still feature the number somewhere in the design, it is far from mandatory and plenty of artists and shops now branch out into different themes.
However, the presence of the unlucky 13 in tattoo stencils and pieces well predates the 1990s. Before heavy ink was associated with being a rock musician or a criminal in the U.S., it originally conjured images of sailors, who were well known for ornamenting their skin starting in the 18th century.
Having seen the practice performed by peoples native to other continents and countries they sailed to, the mariners took a liking to this cultural practice and brought news and demonstrations of it back to the Western world. While the actual tradition of tattooing dates back much further than the 18th century, it was around this time that sailors and ink were closely associated.
It's speculated that these sailors, known to be a superstitious bunch, already knew about the unlucky nature of the number 13 and, in some form of tattoo reverse psychology, would have the number etched into their skin as a means of warding off the bad luck.
Be ready to wait: Most tattoo shops offering Friday the 13th deals operate on a walk-in basis for the day, meaning you won't be able to make an appointment in advance. You are likely to have to wait in a line once you arrive, so be prepared.
Prepare to pick a design: Tattoos offered as part of Friday the 13th events are usually predesigned and laid out on what is called a flash sheet, or a collection of relatively simple and small images you can choose from. Often, these designs are in a traditional or neotradional style — think Sailor Jerry — and are themed for the day with the number "13" somewhere in the sketch.
Choose an appropriate placement: Once you're there, it's as simple as picking a design off the sheet and waiting your turn. Usually, these deals are for tattoos on the arms or legs only and are about the size of a quarter dollar up to the inner palm of your hand. Some shops also participate in a "get what you pick" style game where you pull a number or insert a coin into a gumball-style machine and commit to getting the tattoo you pick out.
Expect it to be crowded: The shop is likely to be crowded and full of artists working quickly on the day, so don't expect a private workstation or to spend a ton of time bonding with your tattooist. Due to the simplicity and small size of the pieces, your session will likely be quick, lasting roughly 10 minutes to half an hour.
Wear proper attire: Some shops see thousands of customers in a single day on Friday the 13th, so if you want to be one of their favorite clients of the day, be prepared for efficiency. Make sure you wear clothing that allows easy access to the area you want tattooed, that you come hydrated, with a full stomach and with clean, showered skin.
Be ready when it's your turn: Expect to wait but also be prepared to select your tattoo and tell the artist what you want when you sit down. Check ahead of time for what kind of payment methods the shop prefers; while many artists accept services like Venmo, some businesses may have different payment instructions for this hectic day.
Pro tip: Tip! Finally, the supreme rule is to tip! While you should always tip the person doing your tattoo, bear in mind that on this day they are seeing way more clients than usual for much, much cheaper than they would usually charge. Because of this, some tattooists find the tradition stressful, so a healthy tip is a great way to show appreciation for their hard work.
Editor's note: Part one of a five-part USA TODAY series revealing why America hasn't solved its long struggle with Type 2 diabetes.
For chef Robin Ray, newly married with young stepchildren, the turning point came when a stabbing chest pain sent her rushing to the emergency room. 
For Brian Castrucci, the gravity hit when the ER doc who had treated him for a near-heart attack a few weeks earlier gave him a big bear hug. “I didn’t think you’d make it,” the doctor said.
The crisis unspooled more slowly for James Haynes but started in 2019 when he stepped on a rusty nail and didn’t notice. 
The moments were turning points for all three to get serious about addressing their diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can’t properly regulate blood sugar, has become so common it’s almost considered inconsequential. More than 1 in 10 Americans have the disease (though many don't know) and another nearly 4 in 10 are at risk for it. In total, half of all adults and a quarter of teenagers have diabetes or pre-diabetes.
Its financial costs are astronomical. The country spends more than $300 billion a year to address diabetes, accounting for $1 out of every $4 spent on health care. 
And its personal tolls are even worse: heart attacks, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, double the risk of premature death. It also causes what’s known as “diabetes distress,” the daily burdens and emotional toll of living with and managing a chronic ailment that can lead to regular dips in energy, foggy thinking and depression, and a sense of isolation.
The most frustrating aspect of Type 2 diabetes, experts say, is that it has long been largely preventable and controllable. 
“We have made tremendous gains in understanding diabetes,” said Dr. Donald Berwick, a pediatrician and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “The best diabetes care can make a very big difference. You can’t say we don’t know what to do.”
And yet, diagnosed rates of Type 2 diabetes have soared over the past 25 years, and especially over the past dozen – particularly among working-age adults like Ray, Castrucci and Haynes. 
Roughly 40% of people who died early in the coronavirus pandemic had Type 2 diabetes, a rate four times higher than people without the disease. Even when elevated blood sugar levels are below the threshold for type 2 diabetes, the risk for heart disease jumps 30% to 50% compared with people with normal blood sugar levels. (Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 5% to 10% of diabetes, is caused by the immune system and is unrelated to diet or lifestyle.)
America’s failure to address Type 2 diabetes highlights larger problems with our food and medical systems, Berwick and other experts said.
A soda costs less than a bottle of water, a double cheeseburger and fries less than a carton of blueberries. Patients wait months for medical appointments only to see the back of a white coat for the short time they’re allotted. Treating disease costs society far more than preventing it but typically provides more profit for insurance companies, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry.
The USA TODAY Health team spoke with scores of health care providers, researchers, community leaders and patients for this five-part series to understand why Type 2 diabetes continues to worsen in America despite known solutions.
The answer isn't simple. It involves systemic problems facing everyone in society, not just those with diabetes: a food system designed to sell products; a medical system in which cutting off a leg is less expensive than saving it; the high cost of healthy living and the fact that breaking habits takes a lot more than just personal willpower.
This first story looks at what it takes for people to cope with or overcome the disease.
Then, we explore one community in a David vs. Goliath battle against a food system that fails to prioritize people's health.

The system is fixable, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.
But it will take "sensible action" from across many sectors, including health care, science, nutrition, business, public health and politics to change the financial and other incentives that drive so many Americans toward sickness instead of health.
"If we do it all, we could fix a lot of this in 10 years," said Mozaffarian, who serves on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. "If we do it incrementally or don't do it at all, we're all going to be toast in 50 years from diet-related illnesses and a depleted environment."
There’s no question personal responsibility plays a role in fighting diabetes. 
Haynes, Ray and Castrucci radically changed their lifestyles and sought help after their come-to-Jesus experiences. They’ve reduced their dependence on daily medication and hope to have saved themselves the horrors of more amputations, blindness and dialysis. They’ve extended their lives and improved the quality of that time.
But like many medical problems, the challenges of diabetes go well beyond individual responsibility and blame. 
“There are structural issues that we have to start paying attention to and addressing,” said Dr. Shivani Agarwal, an endocrinologist who specializes in research and treating young adults with diabetes at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Agarwal recently led a series of studies in the journal The Lancet that looked at diabetes rates around the world. 
Poverty, the studies showed, was a major driver of diabetes, along with racism and unequal access to healthy food and high-quality medical care.
Personal stories illustrate how these structural issues play out in the lives of so many Americans.
Ray, 45, director of culinary operations at HOSCO/North Sarah Food Hub in St. Louis, got weight-loss surgery and then put her culinary expertise to good use.  
Castrucci, 49, who runs a public health nonprofit outside Washington, D.C., used his advantages provided by his work, salary and insurance to “buy” himself better health.
 “I’m healthy because of privilege – not diet, not exercise, not determination,” he said.
Haynes, 58, a former truck driver and maintenance technician in Gulfport, Mississippi, has fewer material assets, but his attitude and the advantages he does have explain why he's still around, despite all he has been through.
“It’s going to be all right after a while, as long as I keep this spirit,” he said.
Ray’s love for food began when she was 8 years old, watching Julia Child on TV. During family gatherings, she would run around taking everyone’s dinner order. Then she’d scurry back to the kitchen with a notepad full of scribbles. 
Throughout her life, she made fried chicken, pork chops, baked mac and cheese, collard greens, and even a whole roasted chicken filled with wild rice and two sticks of butter – everything that made her soul sing. 
In her world, food was home. Food was family. Food was love. 
But that was some pretty tough love. 
In 2002, Ray was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Her father, grandmother, aunts and uncles all had diabetes. She knew what it meant.
“For you to tell me I can’t have ice blue raspberry Kool-Aid was like you shut down my world,” Ray said. “I didn’t want to accept it. So, I ate, because you eat through your emotions.” 
She didn't dwell on the diagnosis and continued with life. Her culinary career took her to Italy, where she learned and fell even more in love with food. She returned to St. Louis, got married and became a mom to her husband’s two children ‒ “beautiful bonus babies,” as she described them. Through the years, she continued to express love through cooking and eating. 
In 2015, a stabbing chest pain sent her to the emergency room. Doctors assured Ray she hadn’t had a heart attack, but they warned that her life was on the line. At 5-foot-2, she weighed 334 pounds and had an A1C, a measure of average blood sugar of 11%, well above the 6.5% cutoff to be considered diabetic. Her diabetes – and her diet – were out of control. 
“That scared me. … It was gut-wrenching and terrifying,” she said. “I’m fighting against something that’s fighting me back and I did not know how to win.” 
She and her primary care doctor decided she would pursue weight loss surgery. 
But she also decided to use her culinary prowess to transform her diet. She reconfigured favorite foods, substituting healthier ingredients: Collard greens cooked in smoked fats or ham hocks turned into a kale, turnip and rutabaga recipe flavored with natural chicken broth fat, oils and seasonings. 
She fostered her feelings into new recipes and brought them to North Sarah Food Hub, which partnered with Barnes-Jewish Hospital to make packaged, pre-made meals for St. Louis residents with diabetes and limited access to fresh food.
“I had to restructure the food that I put in my mouth. I had to think about what I was eating and how I was eating and how it was going to be good for my body,” she said. “I became excited about food again, and food became a joy.” 
It isn’t always easy, of course. Ray admits to an occasional cookie craving. But now she takes the time to think about how her body processes that cookie and whether it’s worthwhile. 
She hopes her cooking can help other people make the same transformation she did. Her staff at North Sarah helps her create new recipes for others. She wants to provide nourishment that allows people to avoid illness and medicine. 
“Nobody wants to take 55 pills, nobody wants to feel like a patient, but how do you fix that? It’s by our food,” she said. “That should be what we’re teaching our community and our culture and our children. … It’s not always about the macaroni noodle with a smile, it’s about what’s good for your body.” 
Castrucci is a third-generation diabetes patient. The lifetime risk of developing Type 2 diabetes if a parent has it is 40%. If both parents have it, the risk jumps to 70%.
He knew he was at risk, but he pushed his luck, he said, by eating poorly during the pandemic and falling out of his exercise routine. With the luxury of working from home, walking to the kitchen and bathroom was often the extent of his daily activity.
On Feb. 14, 2022 – Valentine’s Day – he went to an urgent care clinic, concerned his breathing trouble meant he had bronchitis. His blood pressure measured 210 over 110, well above normal levels that top out at 120 over 80. A chest X-ray showed fluid filling his lungs, leading to congestive heart failure. 
The clinic sent him straight to a local emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a blockage of the left descending artery – a clogged artery made worse by diabetes. If he had waited any longer, he would have had a massive heart attack, his doctor later told him.
After his release from the hospital, he went to the drugstore to fill his new prescriptions. The pharmacist told him she couldn’t fill one because it would cost $1,000. He’d have to wait until his insurance approved it. “Please fill it,” he said. She stressed the cost. “Fill it,” he pleaded, putting the charge on his credit card.
Medication helped him lose 70 pounds in three months. When his local drugstore ran out of the weight-loss drug, he easily drove to another pharmacy and then another to find what he needed. 
His 100 hours of high-quality cardiac rehabilitation were fully covered by insurance.  
"For my midlife crisis, I got healthy," Castrucci said.
He could devote all his energy to getting well because he didn’t have to focus on how to afford his care. “(I) paid almost nothing for the whole episode,” he said, “and never worried about it because I have really good insurance.” 
Even so, Castrucci pays out-of-pocket for a cardiologist and an endocrinologist because the best ones near him don’t accept insurance.
Every time he goes to Walgreens to refill his medications, Castrucci said, he sees someone turned away because they can’t afford their prescriptions. When they finally show up in the emergency room, “because they will,” they will cost the system far more, he said.
“Health outcomes are dictated by economics. It’s a whole side of privilege that we don’t always talk about.”
On the day Haynes stepped on a rusty nail in 2019, he walked all day as the nail pierced the sole of his sneaker and then his foot. By the time he took off his shoe that night, his foot was infected. He landed in the hospital for two months as doctors and nurses tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to get the infection and Haynes’ blood sugar under control.
By the time he was released, he knew enough about Type 2 diabetes to realize his daily blood sugar levels – typically in the mid-400s – were four times above what he had been told to shoot for.
But nothing he did or ate seemed to make a difference. He had long since traded ribs for salads, beer for water. 
His wife, Angela, barely noticed when James started wearing multiple pairs of socks, pouring powder on his feet and buying bigger shoes. His feet tingled a lot, he said, but he was coping with it. 
James ended up in the emergency room again, dehydrated and in need of antibiotics. The doctor amputated the baby toe on his right foot, leaving a large open wound. 
"We're going to leave this open because we'll probably have to take more,” Angela remembered the doctor saying. “I didn't like that we're not going to try to save anything, we're just going to start cutting.”
James was fading.
His arm muscles shriveled and he lost his Popeye physique. Antibiotics left him looking sickly, his voice so weak Angela could barely hear him. “I felt like I was watching my husband slowly dying,” she said.
Finally, taking her doctor sister’s advice, Angela emailed Dr. Foluso Fakorede’s office to ask for an appointment. She thought it would take months to get James in to see the heart disease specialist, but the office called and asked if they could come the next day. 
The Hayneses would end up going back to see Fakorede many times − sometimes twice in one week, driving more than five hours each way from Gulfport north to Cleveland, Mississippi.
“We started looking forward to these visits because there was always hope,” Angela Haynes said, though she felt guilty they were taking up so much of the important doctor’s time. 
Fakorede, who is on a personal mission to save people with diabetes from amputations, noticed what other doctors had missed. Haynes had blockages in blood vessels on both legs. 
Once he got the blood flowing again, Haynes began to feel better. His flesh returned to its normal color. The wound started healing at last. Walking became easier.
Then disaster struck again. 
On July 2, 2022, Haynes caught COVID-19. "Everything went downhill after that," he said.
During his 13-day illness, the bacteria in his foot raged out of control. He ended up back in the hospital and unable to withstand the long drive to Fakorede’s office.
Every week, a surgeon would come to the door of his hospital room and before even stepping all the way in ask Haynes whether he had decided to get his leg amputated. 
"This is my leg. I was born with this. And you're walking in like you're cutting a piece of cake," Haynes said.
He was worried about how he’d get around, how he’d be able to work to support his family if he had only one leg. No one took the time to explain why they thought the leg needed to come off or how he’d cope without it, Haynes said. 
In late November, he was finally sent home in a wheelchair. But just three weeks later, as he was getting out of the car after wound care, his right leg gave out and he fell to the ground. Back at the hospital, Haynes was told his foot was broken, essentially beyond repair. He agreed to a below-the-knee amputation.
Released right before Christmas, he spent the next three weeks in bed wondering how he’d manage the rest of his life.
Finally, it looked as if his luck might be turning around.
With the leg gone, his diabetes improved. His blood sugar dropped into the 120s or one-teens. His blurry vision cleared up.
During his long hospital stay, he befriended nurses and learned about a program for people who needed prostheses. The man who ran it called early in the year and said he had received a donated leg. If it fit Haynes, he could have it while waiting for insurance to pay for a personalized one. Miraculously, it did. 
Haynes spent the next six months teaching himself to walk again. The donor leg was heavy and uncomfortable. He wasn't mobile enough to hold down a job.
One late spring night, picking up dinner at a nearby restaurant, he headed to the bathroom for a pit stop. A sink had been leaking all day and Haynes slipped in the puddle, falling backward.
He's still recovering from the resulting wrist surgery.
He and Angela are living – barely – off her part-time salary as a secretary and a church organist.
Haynes has tried "at least three or four times" to receive government assistance, but they keep losing his paperwork, or not believing he's disabled, though he once checked himself out of the hospital and arrived at an appointment in his wheelchair to prove he didn't have a leg.
Still, he clings to his faith and the positive attitude he has long used to cheer up himself and others. These are his secret weapons against diabetes and everything else life throws his way.
"I try to put a smile on other people's faces," he said. "It keeps my day going."

The USA TODAY Best-selling Booklist is back!
After a brief hiatus, USA TODAY’s beloved bestsellers list has returned with the features and characteristics that have long made it the People’s Booklist.
Our goal remains the same: Provide book lovers with the best, most accurate snapshot of what people are reading by showing which titles are selling. It is a master list, unbound by genre and format, of what’s selling broadly across the U.S.
“I am so thrilled that the USA Today Best-selling Booklist is coming back!" says bestselling author Colleen Hoover in a statement. "It gives so many authors the wonderful opportunity to be recognized as bestsellers and for readers to discover their next favorite book.”
Hoover, the self-published writer turned bestselling powerhouse who's authored dozens of novels including "It Ends With Us" and "Verity," was the undisputed queen of the Booklist in 2022 and spent weeks atop the list. Her novel "It Starts With Us" claimed the No. 1 spot in its first week, her highest debut ever, selling more than 800,000 copies on its first day of sales. It was her fourth book to hit No. 1 in 2022.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
The USA TODAY list is a ranking of the top-selling titles each week from a broad range of businesses including major chains, independent bookstores and online retailers. It reflects combined sales of titles in print and electronic format, if available. Our data team weighs and compiles those numbers to generate the week's 150 top-selling titles. The rankings reflect sales from the previous Monday through Sunday. The full list will publish online at 6 a.m. Wednesdays, with the top 50 titles publishing in print Thursdays.
The list, which began in 1993, went on hiatus in December. It is the longest-running USA TODAY data journalism project.
In our continued commitment to bring readers more books coverage, USA TODAY is also excited to announce a new content partnership with The Novel Neighbor, an independently owned and operated bookstore in St. Louis. They are expert booksellers and passionate readers who are deeply connected to what their community is reading.

The Gaza Strip, one of the smallest territories in the world, may soon become a bloody battleground as Israeli Defense Forces strike back against Hamas for its brutal, hostage-taking attack on Israel.   
Gaza is at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian hostility, which has existed since the creation of Israel in 1948. The confrontation going on now is another in a long history of Middle Eastern disputes among Israelis, Palestinians, and others.
USA TODAY looks at this tiny Palestinian enclave, its people, and its place in the ongoing conflict.
The Gaza Strip comprises just under 140 square miles of relatively flat coastal plan bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It is central to the conflict involving Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian territories and various regional actors. Urban areas, refugee camps, border crossings and high-risk areas as defined by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs can be seen in the map above.

Gaza's area is slightly greater than twice the size of Washington, D.C. It is home to 2.3 million people in 139 square miles, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Gaza borders Israeli territory on its northeastern and southeastern sides and Egypt to its southwest. To its west, Gaza abuts the Mediterranean Sea.
At least 2.23 million people live in the Gaza Strip, according to the U.N., many of them displaced after leaving or being driven from Israel during its War of Independence and subsequent conflicts. Gaza is often described as one of the world's most densely populated areas, but population density varies across the territory. There are roughly an even number of women and men living there.
With 42,059 people per square mile, Gaza City is the 63rd-most densely inhabited urban region in the world. At least eight Palestinian refugee camps lie in the Gaza Strip and have some of the highest population densities in the world, according to the U.N.
Hamas is the largest Palestinian militant group and has fired rockets from Gaza at Israeli cities in the fighting. It was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and hasand has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2006, then wresting militarily control from another leadership group in 2007. It's committed to the destruction of Israel and is considered a terrorist group by the U.S., the U.K. and other nations.
According to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the socioeconomic situation in Gaza has been in steady decline for more than a decade. Longstanding restrictions on the movement of people and goods to and from Gaza have made living conditions extremely difficult. Israel prevents all access to and from the Gaza Strip by sea and air. Movement of people and goods is restricted to three crossings: Rafah crossing, controlled by Eqypt, and Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings, controlled by Israel.  
Sixty-three percent of the population of Gaza is considered food-insecure, and 81% are living in poverty. Access to clean water and electricity were at crisis levels even before this month's hostilities. The U.N. secretary-general says the blockade and related restrictions contravene international humanitarian law because they target and impose hardship on the civilian population, effectively penalizing them for acts they have not committed.

The United Nations is calling for Israel to rescind an immediate evacuation order it issued for about a million Palestinians living in Gaza, with the U.N. calling the order "horrendous" and warning of a deepening humanitarian crisis.
The Israeli military announced the Gaza evacuation Friday. It's an unprecedented order for about half the population of the sealed-off territory ahead of an expected ground invasion against the ruling Hamas militant group. Palestinians have said there is no real escape in Gaza, which has been under a suffocating 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt. 
"The scale and speed of the unfolding humanitarian crisis is bone-chilling. Gaza is fast becoming a hell hole and is on the brink of collapse," the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said in a Friday statement. "The call from Israeli Forces to move more than 1,000,000 civilians living in northern Gaza within 24 hours is horrendous. This will only lead to unprecedented levels of misery and further push people in Gaza into the abyss."
Hamas, which staged a shocking and brutal attack on Israel nearly a week ago and has fired thousands of rockets since, dismissed the evacuation as a ploy and called on people to stay in their homes.
Alarmed civilians and aid workers, who were already in distress from Israeli airstrikes and a blockade, were sent into chaos. Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City, told The Associated Press through tears that there was no way one million people could evacuate that fast.
“Forget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel. The only concern now is just if you make it, if you’re going to live,” Farsakh said.

Developments:
∎ The number of Palestinians displaced increased by 25% over the past 24 hours, according to an early Friday update from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. More than 423,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza and two-thirds are taking shelter at U.N schools.
∎ Airstrikes have left cities and refugee camps in ruins. And Gaza has been experiencing a full electricity blackout amid Israel's siege of the territory, "which has brought essential health, water and sanitation services to the brink of collapse, and exacerbated food insecurity" according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz has said electricity, water and fuel will not be provided until Israeli hostages are returned.
∎ Public officials and law enforcement agencies across the United States have expressed concern over potential protests on Friday in response to Hamas leadership's call for a global "Day of Rage." The D.C. region has enhanced its security in the area, including in the U.S. Capitol complex, and other major cities have also been on alert.
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.
Gaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian exclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.
Hamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.

Former president and current criminal defendant Donald Trump, the front-runner in the GOP presidential primary, is getting worse.
I realize that’s a mighty high bar for him to clear, but he’s doing it, each day showing independent voters and Republicans who still value sane leadership why he should never be allowed within 10 square miles of the White House.
In the wake of the hideous Hamas attack on Israel, with American lawmakers and both sides of the aisle pledging full support for our ally, Trump’s political instincts told him to slam Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and say: “Israel was not prepared.”
Trump then praised the terrorist organization Hezbollah, which on Wednesday was attacking Israel along its northern border. 
“You know, Hezbollah is very smart,” Trump said. “They’re all very smart.”
MAGA loyalists’ minds won’t be changed by anything, but those voters also won’t be enough, should Trump win the GOP nomination, to get him back into office. He’ll need to win over independents and even some moderate Republicans who put country over party while making headway with the ever-growing number of Generation Z voters who, based on recent elections, broadly reject Trump's MAGA movement.
How is he going to do all that when he's running around the country insulting an ally reeling from an unspeakable terror attack and generally sounding like his brain has turned to oatmeal?
After horrific Hamas attack on Israel,Biden acts presidential while Republicans act like fools.
Consider an assortment of baffling/disturbing comments Trump has made in speeches and on social media just in recent weeks.
He has repeatedly misidentified President Joe Biden as former President Barack Obama, recently saying at a rally “you take a look at Obama and look at some of the things he’s done” and then, in an interview this week about Biden’s response to the attack on Israel, saying, “It’s all coming through Iran, and Obama, he doesn’t want to talk about it. ... He doesn’t even mention them in a statement.”
The Fox News interviewer had to correct him afterward.
In another recent interview, Trump said: “We have the worst education almost in the large world, the world that people know about.” As opposed to the large world people don’t know about?
He said at a rally that the U.S. Capitol “looks like sh-t.”
Referring to Jeb Bush, Trump said: “He got us into the Middle East. How did that work out?” It was President George W. Bush who “got us into the Middle East.”
In a Sept. 15 speech in Washington, D.C., Trump suggested Biden will lead America into World War II, which ended in 1945: “We have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president in the history of our country, who is cognitively impaired, in no condition to lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war. Just think of it, we would be in World War II very quickly if we’re going to be relying on this man.”
When questioning someone’s lucidity, it’s generally best to sound lucid yourself.
Late last month at a rally, Trump mocked Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her husband, who was brutally attacked and beaten in their home last year.
“We’ll stand up to crazy Nancy Pelosi, who ruined San Francisco – how’s her husband doing, anybody know?” Trump said as the crowd laughed. “And she’s against building a wall at our border, even though she has a wall around her house – which obviously didn’t do a very good job.” 
Biden is too old.And so is Trump. As a Gen Z voter, I want younger candidates.
Speaking of immigrants, Trump said in an interview earlier this month: “It is a very sad thing for our country. It’s poisoning the blood of our country.”
That language mirrors lines in Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” and is in line with the way white supremacists discuss immigrants.
Trump has said recently that forest fires could be prevented “if you dampen your forests.”
He said anyone who robs a store should be shot – “If you rob a store you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store. Shot!”
And in a Florida speech this week, he went on this rant (I’ve used all-caps and phonetic spelling to illustrate the pronunciation of words he loudly emphasized): “Instead of keeping terrorists and terrorist sympathizers out of America, the Biden administration is inviting them in. You know why, because he’s got a boss. Who’s his boss? Barack HOO-SANE Obama. Barack Hoo-sane Obama. You remember the great Rush Limbaugh, Barack Hoo-SANE Obama. He’d go, Barack Hoo-SANE Obama.”
Petty criticism of Israel (Trump remains mad at Netanyahu because the prime minister accepted that Biden won the 2020 election), violent rhetoric, mixing up the names of political rivals, mocking an attack on a lawmaker’s spouse and generally sounding like the town drunk slouched at the end of the bar airing conspiratorial grievances. And that’s only a small sample of Trump’s madness over the past few weeks.
Setting aside his two impeachments, his incitement of an attack on the U.S. Capitol, his election denialism and the 91 state and federal felony charges he faces, I have to ask independents and on-the-fence Republicans alike: Would you actually vote for that mess? Is that really the best the Republican Party can offer America and the world?
People will keep taking swipes at Biden’s age, though Trump is only three years younger. But if you listen and pay attention to the former president, you’ll see a profoundly unhinged man teetering on a full separation from reality.
The ham has slipped off his sandwich. It’s time to stop pretending otherwise.

SDEROT, Israel − They are finding people in basements and stores. Hiding out in one of the rows of abandoned houses and small apartment blocks. On rooftops.
After regaining territorial control, elite Israeli police and military units are actively searching for remaining gunmen, whenever and wherever they find them, a little less than a week after Hamas stormed this town of 30,000 people on the edge of the Gaza Strip.
"Their food and water supply are running out," said a sniper in an anti-terrorism police unit in Sderot who USA TODAY spent time with on patrol Wednesday, referring to Hamas militants. "We're getting more of them now because they need to do something. Move from place to place."
Over 1,000 Hamas fighters infiltrated 22 towns and army bases in a multi-front attack that caught Israel's military off guard. For Israel, this represents the biggest intelligence failure in decades − a blow to a country known for having robust security that is the envy of the world.
Thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed, and thousands more on both sides injured. Over 100 were kidnapped, including more than a dozen Americans.
Such a dramatic and unprecedented attack set off a panic across the world's Jewish communities from the U.S. and Mexico to France and beyond along with Israelis scrambling to track down their loved ones. The attacks are being referred to as Israel's 9/11.
Tuesday night in Sderot and the surrounding areas, 23 gunmen had been hunted down and, ultimately, killed.
On Friday, the Israeli government announced it was evacuating the town.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has targeted Hamas, saying, "every Hamas member is a dead man." As he tries to regain complete territorial control of a country roughly the size of New Jersey, Netanyahu has mounted a large-scale air strike in Gaza that killed more than 1,350 people and put tanks along the border. Now, patrol cars are zooming the militarized streets of southern Israel.
The member of the police unit, a sniper, asked for his name to be withheld because of the sensitive nature of his work and concern over potential reprisals from Hamas against him or his family. He said he killed two members of Hamas on Saturday during the initial assault on Sderot. At least 27 police officers like him were killed in the area. As for civilians, police still won't say.
The sniper spent Tuesday night on a roof of an Israeli military base that was briefly captured by Hamas on the first day of the siege. The base sits off of a main road that looks over and across to the nearby Gaza barrier. He said his unit was authorized to kill anyone who tried to cross this road without permission.
"We are waiting for new waves of Hamas to come," he said.
Israeli authorities are also continuously mobilizing to trace, capture and kill, if necessary, Hamas holdouts in and around Sderot, even though Israel's Defense Forces says it has regained full control of the areas of the south like Sderot that were attacked by Hamas.
Roei Valdman, a commander in Israel's police who is responsible for an area that includes Gaza, Sderot and several other cities, said that his officers are being inundated with calls from people "who hear terrorists, who hear shootings... People are afraid."
Valdman estimated that approximately 1% of these calls turn out to be "a real case, a real event." However, he said that it was not possible to know for sure how many Hamas members could still be in Sderot or the surrounding area.
For the actual cases of Hamas infiltrators identified, "it's a hunt." His forces, side by side with the military, deploy helicopters, armored vehicles and other specialized equipment to catch or kill them.
Hamas, he said, was still managing to cross the Gaza border in "ones and twos" but so far, for the last several days, they have not been able to attack any civilians.
Valdman spoke from Sderot's temporary police headquarters, a community center in the town. On Saturday, Hamas seized Sderot's police station, leading to a standoff with security forces that lasted through the night until Valdman's commander, Amir Cohen, decided to have it demolished with bulldozers, with members of Hamas trapped inside.
Eight of Valdman's officers were killed inside the station as it was overrun by Hamas. They were heavily outgunned and outmanned. About two dozen Hamas members occupied the station, around which they had set up booby traps preventing police from storming it.
Cohen, a senior border police commander, sported a shiner on Wednesday in the halls of the center. The black eye was the result, an aide said, of Cohen fighting off Hamas as the attack on Sderot unfolded.
Valdman said that there were only 10 officers in Sderot on duty when they were attacked. The assault fell in the middle of a Jewish holiday. With the army overwhelmed along the border, the defense of the town fell to the police for the first hours.
Eventually, an elite counter-terrorism unit with the Israel Defense Forces came with reinforcements.
"Of course we are trained to deal with terrorism but most of the time we are dealing with crime and ordinary citizen concerns around here," said Valdman, who believes the fast response from his officers helped prevent a larger massacre in Sderot.
The makeshift police station at the center of town was swarming this week with hundreds of rescue workers, police, army and special forces. They filtered in and out on different missions. Donations − meals, soap and toothpaste, cases upon cases of water − sat on an outdoor concrete square that had a basketball court on it and was covered from the sun.
Israel's President Isaac Herzog paid a brief visit and urged the international community to demand the release of hostages taken by Hamas.
Throughout the hour, air raid sirens would go off, sending several dozen people who were loitering outside smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee and making small talk scrambling for cover inside. This was followed by loud thuds and bangs. On Sunday, the center received a direct hit from one of the barrage of missiles that Hamas is sending over the border each day. But the damage was not significant. And no one was hurt.
"A week ago, I had just come back from a vacation in Norway, and I thought I was about to go on a work trip to Canada. I barely had time to wash my clothes before I was called up for duty," said one soldier, who was passing by a USA TODAY reporter as he waited on a wooden bench inside the center for the latest all clear after a round of missile fire from Gaza.
The patrol unit that the sniper is part of is working 12-hour shifts to investigate every serious report that comes in about Hamas militants: sightings, strange noises, rumors.
It also rushes to the scene of rocket attacks in Sderot to assist any wounded and because, according to the sniper, "sometimes Hamas attacks places it has just fired on."
There's a lot of time sitting around, eating snacks, some good-humored roasting. At one point, the sniper was given a shoulder massage by another member of his unit.
"This work is not too scary if you don't think about it too much," confided another officer.
Like the sniper, none of the other officers can be identified for security reasons.
A lot of time sitting around − until there isn't.
A crackly message came through on the radio.
A dozen heavily armed police commandoes and one reporter piled into two large vans and sped around Sderot's deserted streets. Up front, in the passenger's seat, the unit's commander wedged his automatic weapon, ready to fire, between the vehicle's mirror and its windshield frame. Many of the town's residents have evacuated to other parts of Israel, but many have remained behind. They've been told to stay indoors.
The report that had come in was of a rocket attack on a house in Sderot.
The location was near a cluster of homes on a cul-de-sac.
Within a few minutes of arriving it became clear there was no sign of a rocket here. Just a dog barking in a high pitch and a couple of residents trying to communicate and gesture to the unit from behind a head-level wall outside their home about 50 feet away.
Then, another report came. There may have been shots fired.
"Get down," the unit's commander ordered.
That too was over before it started.
Back in the van, yet another order had arrived, this time to search a house where a rocket definitely had landed just 10 minutes earlier.
"We're going to do a quick check for casualties," said the sniper, shortly before the door was kicked open. In the sky above, small clusters of shiny smoke trails could be seen.
These could be rockets just launched from Gaza, where the intensity of Israel's bombing campaign has sent up large plumes of dust and ash and led to scenes of apocalyptic destruction. Or Israeli missiles sent to intercept them.
Inside, the house seemed lived in.
A half-eaten piece of chocolate cake, spoon resting quietly on a plate, sat on the dining table. There was a jumble of clothes strewn across the sofa. A musty human odor.
The rocket had fallen straight through what looked like the main bedroom and hallway upstairs, exposing a twisted and gnarly web of wires, plaster, wooden beams, steel mesh.
The stairway, walls, doors, floor and ceiling were covered in a light gray dust. A part of the missile was lying in the bathroom, near the toilet.
No wounded, no people, though. No signs of Hamas.
"It's clean," said the sniper. "We're leaving. Stay close."

The first school resource officer came into existence in the late 1950s under the guise that having a police officer in the school would "improve" the relationship between youth and law enforcement – a novel claim that helped SRO programs multiply. It's estimated that 20% of schools have an officer.
Yet, despite this original claim that relationships with the youth would improve, there has not been any conclusive evidence that an officer presence improves youth relationships with law enforcement. In fact, the research is quite mixed. 
The UAW strike against the Ford Kentucky Truck Plant is a signal that hourly workers are willing to inflict − and sustain − increasingly serious financial pain to achieve their goals during labor negotiations, as the union and the Detroit Three approach a full month without resolution.
The financial impact of the surprise strike called Wednesday night was swift and immediate.
LAS VEGAS – The Green Bay Packers aren’t a talentless team.
They probably have as much or more talent than two of the three teams that have beaten them this year.
But, boy, are they a bad team.
Their offense is a mess. Their defense can be pretty good but only to a point. They are affected any time one of their starters can’t play because of injury. And they have too many players who just do what they’re told and not whatever it takes to be a difference-maker.

Lior Onaly-Kelsey celebrated their 15th birthday two weeks ago. They also celebrated the end of a years-long battle against Greater Albany Public School District.
A federal jury in Eugene this month awarded them $317,353 in damages, concluding the district had discriminated against Onaly-Kelsey when they were in the third grade and failed to properly respond to harassment and bullying.
At a park near their house, Onaly-Kelsey seems happy and curious, eagerly sharing stories about rock climbing and participating in their current school's robotics club.
Their excitement to be a teen attending a Corvallis high school is a stark difference from their emotions as an Albany elementary school student.
Prepare yourself for a bit of a diminished product this weekend as the NFL steams into Week 6 of the 2023 regular season.
No compelling matchup to lase onto – 49ers-Browns, Lions-Buccaneers and Cowboys-Chargers probably the best offerings. If you've enjoyed the London element, the Ravens and Titans will meet in the final one of this season (though we're off to Germany in Week 9). And if train wrecks are your thing, the careening Patriots head to Las Vegas to face old friend Josh McDaniels and the Raiders, while the Vikings and Bears clash in a matchup of 1-4 teams.
Star power is also going to be a bit lighter, Minnesota WR Justin Jefferson and breakout rookies Anthony Richardson (Colts) and De'Von Achane (Dolphins) among those sidelined.
What does it all mean in terms of wins and losses? Our football experts try to make sense of this week's circumstances:

Spoon Daftary apologized into his headset for a slightly rushed segment, but the clock was already ticking on this commercial break. 
"Just go with the flow," the "Thursday Night Football" senior coordinating producer ordered from the command truck at FedEx Field, not long after the Chicago Bears defeated the Washington Commanders. "Everyone have fun here." 
That’s usually not an issue for the traveling studio crew of Richard Sherman, Andrew Whitworth, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Tony Gonzalez and host Charissa Thompson – the people Daftary is instructing from the truck. They were about to play a game, he said, as celebrity chef David Chang rejoined the set. 
It’s a simple premise. Producers from the truck will put up a name on the screen. The panel must answer whether that person played in the NFL or is a United States Congressperson – "On the Hill" or "On the Field" – all while chowing down on spicy chicken sandwiches from Chang’s restaurant.
"Roll the dice here," Daftary said. "What can go wrong?" 
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
The hijinks may lose a viewer more interested in a traditional NFL post-game show. But for the type of content Daftary’s bosses at Amazon Prime Video desire, this is par for the course. 
Now in the second year of exclusively streaming the games, Daftary wants the postgame show to be memorable enough – through both creative bits and substantive football conversation – sports fans are talking about it Friday morning. 
"My dream is somebody says, ‘Ah, (expletive), I fell asleep. What did I miss?’" Daftary told USA TODAY Sports. "That’s what I want to continue to push to our staff and to our talent. I want our show to be that: ‘I gotta stay up late to watch.’" 
As Daftary and executive producer Mike Muriano started building the “TNF” studio team, they were aware of the natural constraints all pregame, halftime and postgame shows have structurally. But as Amazon became the league's first new media partner in nearly 30 years, the company also saw the opportunity of a blank canvas. 
"We're OK with this feeling a little more raw and authentic, I think, than sort of the polished Sunday morning pregame shows that I've been a part of in the past," said Daftary, who spent nine years at FOX, where he held the same role for "FOX NFL Kickoff." 
Daftary said FOX’s takeover of the NFC package in 1993 ushered in the modern era of studio programming. A streaming giant taking center stage for the NFL one night per week represented a chance to take another step toward the boundaries. 
"Collectively, we're just like, ‘We have to take some swings, we know not everything’s gonna be great," Daftary said. "But like, we want to take the swings and see where we land." 
One place they landed this season was Intercourse, Pennsylvania, for a dispatch by contributor Marshawn Lynch from Amish country. 
That type of segment likely would not have been flown at network television. At Amazon, it’s encouraged. 
"It's refreshing," Muriano told USA TODAY Sports. "Sometimes, senior management is saying ‘No, push a little bit more’ and we're the ones going, ‘Hey, not that far.’" 
Finding talking heads who took the job seriously – but not necessarily themselves – has been essential in delivering a different type of show, Muriano said. Their willingness to pitch ideas makes the show that much better, he added. 
"We've got a group that is invested that way, which again, that's so rewarding to see that you're not the only one trying to come up with everything," said Muriano, who has been involved in producing every "Thursday Night Football" game in NFL history. "The show is better for it." 
Thompson, Fitzpatrick, Sherman, Whitworth, Gonzalez and the producers will have a video call – a 45-minute brain dump, as Daftary put it – every Monday to discuss that week’s upcoming game. From there, the producers begin outlining a show ahead of a Monday afternoon production call in which the sketch becomes more of a rundown. Last week, when Daftary mentioned that Fitzpatrick lost his mind upon hearing that Commanders part-owner Magic Johnson would be joining the pregame show, the producers started coming up with ideas to leverage his fanboying into a made-for-TV moment. 
Reading the letters Fitzpatrick wrote to Johnson as a boy was one idea. The crew brainstormed ways for Johnson to sign items for Fitzpatrick and how to place that into the segment. Of course, it would have to be right before commercial break. And they’d have to make sure Johnson sat next to the former quarterback. 
When it was showtime 72 hours later, Fitzpatrick was all smiles as he unveiled his No. 32 Lakers jersey beneath his signature zany button-down shirt. 
"Spoon allows for that creativity, allows for us to have a little bit of fun on set," Fitzpatrick told USA TODAY Sports. "So the fact we do have that leeway and he’s given us that creative freedom, I think really helps the process. We don’t feel limited or put in boxes."
The postgame show – "TNF Nightcap" – is the aspect of the production the team takes “a ton” of pride in, Daftary said.
"That’s a place we have an open canvas to do a lot of things that other shows don’t – between our guest interviews and our actual football conversations, which, by the way, I would put up against anybody else’s actual football conversations," Daftary said. 
Through four weeks, "TNF Nightcap" is averaging 2.08M viewers, which is an increase of 24% over last year’s full-season average (1.68M), according to Prime Video. (“TNF Tonight,” the pregame show, is averaging 500,000 more viewers per week compared to 2022.)
The morning of the Bears-Commanders matchup, the crew met in a hotel conference room to review the show rundown. On more than one occasion, as Daftary lead the meeting, the talent are told to save it for the show.
"We've been part of shows where almost every word is rehearsed and gone through," Muriano said. "And we've been shown we've been on parts of shows where not enough of that has happened as well."
Finding the sweet spot is the challenge of creating programming in 2023 for a streaming service. Other market forces, like podcasts, have influenced the way they construct the show too. 
"It's so less-produced," Daftary said. "So how do we still produce a show that feels network-level where our halftime is gonna be viewed by (millions of) people? So it's not a podcast, we don't want it to be a podcast. The elements in the show have to reach a bar." 
That type of transition made it easier on the trio of Whitworth, Fitzpatrick and Sherman, all of whom went straight from the playing field to analysts’ chairs (Gonzalez and Thompson both had ample television experience prior to joining “TNF”). Everyone had homework following an offseason of reviewing video, and former players' experience make them more coachable than other people Daftary has worked with in the past. 
Making sure they don’t lose their personality by improving for television is a fine line to walk. 
"If something becomes too rehearsed, it just feels like audiences have just gotten so savvy," said Muriano, who has an instant focus-group with four teenage children watching at home. "That teenage radar really just sniffs out when something's not authentic so quickly in this day and age. And I think it's because there's so much content they're consuming in different ways. As soon as they see someone kind of stiffen up, they’re like, ‘Why isn't he just talking normal? Why isn't she just talking normally?’ So we try to stay as real as we can." 
The "TNF" team met throughout the offseason to preview that year's upcoming games. During one of those sessions, it became clear that a "Quiz Bowl" for the Week 3 game between the San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants in the Bay Area would be the perfect setting. Sherman went to Stanford. Gonzalez is a proud Cal product. Fitzpatrick famously graduated from Harvard.
But that "TNF Tonight" led to the most viral moment of the season, with ex-NFL quarterback Andrew Luck dressing in meme version, "Capt. Andrew Luck," a social media account that likened Luck's football conquests to a Civil War-era Union soldier.
"I want a space where everybody can pitch an idea, and anyone can pitch an idea," said Daftary, who almost talked Luck out of dressing up in costume for his postgame appearance only to realize he was overthinking the bit.
"That would be the perfect amount of craziness," he realized.
To close out the Week 5 broadcast from the nation's capital, Daftary and Co. wanted to capitalize on a "wild" week in D.C. Kevin McCarthy had been ousted as Speaker of the House. Something political – but not polarizing – felt appropriate.
"Is this going to be the greatest thing ever? Probably not," Daftary said. "But it’ll be a fun way to end the show. We got David Chang, we got fried chicken sandwiches."
With the cameras rolling, Thompson – the only one who had prior knowledge of the game – accidentally gave away the answer to the first question.
No memes or viral posts came from the segment. A few laughs for sure. The show ended with Daftary shaking the hands of those around him in the truck. He said the segment featuring Fitzpatrick being honored at his high school the previous weekend was too much. Muriano assured him it was fine.
"I'm not going to lose sleep over it," Daftary said.
He hopes everyone else watching did.
Be careful what you wish for, Dallas Cowboys.
As fallout lingers from the blowout loss at San Francisco, the Cowboys are so deep into their feelings about the 42-10 result that it’s fair to wonder if they are capable of recovering – physically and mentally.
During his podcast, "The Edge with Micah Parsons," the Cowboys' star linebacker took exception to the "(expletive) Dallas" T-shirt that 49ers tight end George Kittle wore under his jersey as he scorched Dallas for three touchdowns. Kittle revealed his wardrobe accessory on a social media post on Monday.
 "I just feel like he’s making it way more personal than it had to be," Parsons said Tuesday. "Kittle’s my guy, but I'ma say this: laugh now, cry later. We got something for that. If we see them again, just trust."
Trust the Cowboys? No way.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
The Cowboys, 28 years and counting since the franchise’s last whiff of Super Bowl glory, have proven (again) that they cannot be trusted as a legitimate contender. Maybe that changes by January. But that needs to be proven in the flesh as they’ve over-promised so many times before in morphing from America’s Team to America’s Biggest Tease. Such an identity remains intact about now.
At this point, any threats coming from the Cowboys about what they’ll do to the 49ers have zero credibility. Remember, Dallas was supposed to use the prime-time showcase on Sunday night as a measuring stick. And the 49ers basically took that stick and cracked the Cowboys on the butt with it.
The defense that Parsons leads? The Cowboys went to San Francisco with the unit allowing the fewest points in the league, like 10 points per game. They left as the defense that gave up six touchdowns and 421 yards and had a terrible time getting off the field on third downs.
So, again, any promises about what will happen if they see them again would be ill-advised.
Thus, the 49ers are still scoring points in this rout – of which Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said “may be the most humbling game I’ve ever been a part of” after he faltered in yet another big game – with the social media aftermath.
Deebo Samuel, the electric and versatile 49ers receiver, had a pointed response to Parsons’ take:
"It was always personal before the game started," Samuel told Kay Adams on the "Up & Adams" podcast. "42-10, I don’t think you wanna see us again. It might be a little worse."
Ouch. Or touchdown, 49ers.
Can we stick a fork in the Cowboys already and declare that this season is kaput? Maybe not yet. It’s the NFL, with its week-to-week reality checks. Look at what happened to Buffalo, a week after destroying the Dolphins: They went to London to get served up by the Jaguars.
This is not the time of year to draw conclusions about what will happen in January – even though it seems clear that if they stay healthy, the 49ers and Eagles will be major factors. And as long as Patrick Mahomes is in the lineup, the Chiefs have a shot.
Dallas? Perhaps the Cowboys (3-2) peaked with a 40-0 beatdown of the Giants on opening night. A week after handing Bill Belichick the worst margin of defeat in his career, blasting the not-so-good Patriots, 38-3, Mike McCarthy suffered the most decisive loss in his three-plus years as Cowboys coach.
"It’s been a wide range of performance, as wide a range that I could ever recall in a 5-week period," McCarthy said after the debacle on Sunday night.
On paper, the Cowboys are not done yet.
There are 12 games left. Just one of Dallas’ next six opponents – Philadelphia (5-0) – currently has a winning record. A path to get back into the race in the NFC East still exists, given the two matchups looming against the Eagles in November and December. Then again, the Eagles will be just as eager as the 49ers to demonstrate a special kind of animosity toward Dallas.
In any event, the expectation correction for the Cowboys has just happened. After showing that figuratively they don’t belong on the same field with the 49ers, the Cowboys find themselves facing a must-win predicament when meeting the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium on Monday night.
Never mind the subplot of facing a Chargers offense now orchestrated by Kellen Moore, the former Cowboys coordinator. It’s about survival, or at least rebounding to restore some confidence after absorbing so many blows during the humiliating loss on Sunday night.
As Kittle, of all people, pointed out on Sunday night, there’s also a pattern to watch when it comes to what happens after teams play the 49ers. Kittle suggested that there’s a residual effect.
"We’re a violent, physical football team," Kittle said, alluding to the smashmouth style on offense that complements a punishing defense. "That’s the standard of the 49ers. Last year, every team that played us lost the next week."
It’s a striking pattern. Including the playoffs, teams that played the 49ers last season were 0-15 in games the following week. The Chiefs won their next game after facing San Francisco last October, but it came after Kansas City had a bye week. And the Eagles had a bye week following the NFC title game, although it indeed lost in the Super Bowl.
Pittsburgh snapped the “next-week” streak last month. Blown out by the 49ers in Week 1, the Steelers rallied to defeat Cleveland the following week. The next three 49ers opponents, though, followed suit with last season’s pattern and lost the following week.
Now the trend is attached to Dallas’ challenge to get back on track after a grueling loss to the 49ers. 
Tony Pollard, the Cowboys running back limited to 29 rushing yards at San Francisco, was upbeat on Sunday night when assessing how they can rebound.
"Get back to work," Pollard said. "Go back to the lab. You have to prepare. You have to get ready and brush it off. We’ll see this team again, so we have to lock in for the next one."
See the 49ers again? Officially, that’s a maybe for the Cowboys this season.
No, the Cowboys likely can’t achieve the dream of winning a championship without getting past the 49ers. But considering the way San Francisco has owned them in recent years, the Cowboys had better be careful of what they wish for.
NFL power rankings entering Week 6 of the 2023 season (previous rank in parentheses):
1. 49ers (1): What else is there to say about a team that's been in the top spot since the season started? S.F.’s +99 point differential is already 20 better than the next team. Probably have the best defense (though that can be settled at Cleveland on Sunday). Might have the best offense. Stars on basically every unit. And second-year QB Brock Purdy continues to effectively play mistake-free football, his league-leading 123.1 passer rating testament to that.
2. Eagles (3): They're 5-0 in successive seasons for the first time. Next up, the Jets – a team Philadelphia has never lost to in 12 previous meetings. Feels safe to slot the reigning NFC champs at 6-0 and look ahead to their Week 7 date with Miami.
3. Lions (5): For all the focus on rookie Jahmyr Gibbs, it's veteran RB David Montgomery who's fueled a ground game with more rushes than any team in the league save two. Sunday, Montgomery became the first Detroit rusher to top 100 yards in consecutive games since … Kevin Jones in 2004.
4. Chiefs (6): Here's a stat that might surprise you – RB Isiah Pacheco leads Kansas City with 424 yards from scrimmage, nearly double TE Travis Kelce's total (222).
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
5. Bills (2): Just as LB Von Miller returns from the PUP list following last year's knee injury, LB Matt Milano (leg) could be lost for the remainder of this season. Weird as this sounds, Milano might be the more valuable player to Buffalo's defense.
6. Dolphins (7): How fast is Miami? Per Next Gen Stats, the Fins have produced the five top speeds among all plays this season and seven of the top nine. WR Tyreek Hill and RBs De'Von Achane and Raheem Mostert are responsible for them (and WR Jaylen Waddle has also cracked the top 20). Big-play Achane is averaging a ridiculous 12.1 yards per carry and 115.0 rushing yards per game, both figures best in the NFL. But seems likely a knee injury will force veteran Jeff Wilson to spot Achane in the coming weeks.
7. Jaguars (14): The first team to play multiple international games in a season is now the first to win multiple – both coming against teams with winning records. Stay in Europe, Jags – it seems inevitable, and you're apparently better for it.
8. Cowboys (4): Good thing they're not part of the NFC West … even if it would make more sense geographically. In its two defeats (to Arizona and San Francisco), Dallas has lost by a collective 70-26. Worse, the Niners seemed to expose how limited the Mike McCarthy offense might actually be.
9. Steelers (12): They've gained the third-fewest yards in the league and surrendered the third most, the delta more than 600 yards. But 11 takeaways, 17 sacks and just enough clutch plays from QB Kenny Pickett can mask such warts … and propel you to the top of the AFC North.
10. Ravens (8): It's been an uneven start, to say the least, but it's also unusual to play four of five away from home so early in the season – and Baltimore's three-game roadie winds to a conclusion Sunday in London.
11. Rams (9): Sure, they're 2-3, but they've hung tough against the league's top teams, San Francisco and Philadelphia. Appears WRs Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua will complement each other nicely, each getting at least 11 targets Sunday, Kupp's 2023 debut.
12. Seahawks (10): Coming off their bye, they're currently not scheduled to face a team with a winning record until November. Time to make serious hay toward a playoff berth.
13. Browns (13): Semi-eventful bye week with GM Andrew Berry explaining QB Deshaun Watson's last-minute scratch in Cleveland's previous game while defending the trade of obviously capable veteran QB2 Josh Dobbs during preseason.
14. Buccaneers (16): This marks three times in four years that QB Baker Mayfield has won three of his first four starts. His only 4-1 beginning led to a deep playoff run in Cleveland.
15. Saints (20): Great sidebar to Sunday's 34-0 runaway in New England. TE Foster Moreau, a New Orleans native, scored his first TD with the Saints – and first since beating Hodgkin lymphoma during the offseason. Pretty cool story amid the NFL's annual "Crucial Catch" campaign for cancer screening.
16. Falcons (18): If you know anything about the NFL, and running backs in particular, best to appreciate their genius while you can. Thankfully, Bijan Robinson has been putting his on display week in and week out, Sunday's TD catch-and-run a thing of beauty.
17. Colts (17): QB2 Gardner Minshew II may be the league's best reliever, but Indianapolis surely didn't count on him playing 50% of the snaps to this point – a figure that's going to rise as Anthony Richardson's sprained throwing shoulder heals.
18. Texans (11): No matter Sunday's outcome, this will be their best six-game start since 2019. But it would help if Houston would run the ball better after cracking 90 yards just once so far this season.
19. Titans (21): WR DeAndre Hopkins' 100-yard day courtesy of Ryan Tannehill was the 11th time he's topped the century mark with a different quarterback. Get a C-note with two more passers, and Nuk sets a league record … so might be worthy lobbying for playing time for Malik Willis and rookie Will Levis.
20. Chargers (22): Did you know WR Keenan Allen owns the NFL record for most games – three – with at least 15 receptions? With wingman Mike Williams down for the count, wouldn't be a shock if Allen extends that mark before this year is out.
21. Jets (24): Only 12 games into his career, he hardly has enough totes to qualify – but if he did, Breece Hall's 6.3 yards per carry would be a record among RBs. Unfortunately, could be hard to sustain that with OL Alijah Vera-Tucker (Achilles) headed to injured reserve.
22. Bengals (26): They'll only be on the road two more times before December, so maybe the comforts of home are good for QB Joe Burrow's calf and team focus with a brutal upcoming schedule (Seattle, San Francisco, Buffalo) for a Cincinnati club that may finally otherwise be turning the corner.
23. Raiders (28): If they're going to salvage their season and use Monday's win as a catapult, now is the time. The Silver and Black face three one-win teams (Patriots, Bears, Giants) over the next four weeks.
24. Packers (19): No worse way to go into a bye week than off a terrible loss. But Green Bay's next three opponents (Broncos, Vikings, Rams) have a combined four wins, so hopefully a good time for the Pack to get healthy figuratively and literally.
25. Vikings (25): Why is offensive balance often a virtue? Consider one-win Minnesota, which has thrown more passes (204) than any team in the league while attempting the fewest runs (91). However that calculus might have to change with All-Pro Justin Jefferson's hamstring injury forcing him to IR.
26. Bears (32): The Justin Fields-to-DJ Moore Show has sparked Chicago's revival. But look closer, and you'll also note a running game averaging better than 170 yards the past two weeks and some encouraging signs of life on defense at Washington. The schedule also suggests Da Bears could easily be a .500 team from here on out.
27. Commanders (15): Only Denver has surrendered more points than Washington's 160. Only Minnesota has turned it over more times than Washington's 10. Lethal combo.
28. Broncos (29): Naturally, when you crown yourselves with dopey "snowcapped" helmets, another Rocky Mountain meltdown is completely inevitable.
29. Giants (30): S Jason Pinnock's 102-yard pick-six Sunday is the longest play of the season NFL-wide and provided Big Blue's first TD before halftime this season. Some consolation for a team that hasn't run an offensive play with the lead yet and has now been outscored by a league-most 91 points.
30. Cardinals (27): No NFC team is blitzing less frequently – worth wondering if that's the right approach given the way Arizona's D has been torn up the past two weeks.
31. Patriots (23): If the dynasty wasn't already dead, then life support has officially been unplugged. Bill Belichick wants to "start over" after suffering the two worst defeats of his career with an offense that's been shut out of the end zone for 10 consecutive quarters and has turned it over 10 times.
32. Panthers (31): The NFL's only winless team just turned in its worst defensive performance (42 points allowed) of the season. Its reward? A trip to Miami. Woof.

EXETER, N.H. — Doug Burgum is among the least known of the many long-shot candidates vying to be the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential race.
The North Dakota governor is stuck in the primary's basement, where he typically polls at 1%.
Worse yet, he has struggled to gain much attention or have a breakthrough moment during the two national GOP debates, where White House hopefuls have largely clawed at each other rather than knocking former President Donald Trump, who is the undisputed front-runner.
But Burgum's campaign maintains that he has a window once actual voters, not TV viewers, plug into the race.
The North Dakota governor is joining a series of town halls in Exeter, New Hampshire, hosted by Seacoastonline and the USA TODAY Network to speak directly with those Americans at 10 a.m. Friday.
Here are five things to know about Doug Burgum ahead of the event.
Polling shows that most Americans don't know who Burgum is, and those who do hold a slightly more unfavorable view of him.
But when Burgum, 66, first entered politics as a gubernatorial contender in 2016, he was a long shot most people hadn't heard of before. At that time, he trailed by 49% in the GOP primary against a popular attorney general in North Dakota.
During the state's 2016 Republican convention, the party held a series of votes to endorse a candidate. Burgum finished last in each of those ballots.
But when it came time for the voters to decide, he won his election by 20%, largely running as an outsider in the year that Trump first captured the Republican nomination for president.
Born in Arthur, North Dakota, a small town northwest of Fargo, Burgum attended Stanford University, where he earned a master’s degree in business administration.
In the 1980s, he and his relatives − including his grandparents, who owned an agriculture business − bought Great Plains Software, a software company that eventually was purchased by Microsoft for $1.1 billion in 1997.
Most of Burgum's fundraising comes from his own pocket. He has loaned his campaign more than $10 million.
One of the reasons Burgum hasn't broken away from the pack is how little oxygen is given to this favorite subject: energy.
In a sober delivery style that stays away from culture war or social issues, he has tried to shake the public consciousness about energy's role in America's domestic and foreign policy.
During an August event in Iowa, for instance, Burgum touted his state's pledge to be carbon neutral by 2030, and how they're "doing it with zero mandates, zero regulations."
The U.S. should be committed to alternative fuels, he said, such as ethanol and carbon pipelines. He also supports America having a "homegrown" energy agenda that would leverage a combination of renewable, fossil fuel and nuclear power.
Besides energy, foreign policy is a space Burgum has a wider vision, and he's criticized President Joe Biden's approach to countering America's competition around the world, particularly China.
"We're already in a cold war with China, we're in proxy war with Russia," he said in a video posted to X, formerly known as Twitter.
China being America's chief rival in the 21st century is one of his biggest concerns.
The first campaign ad Burgum launched focused on the foreign country's communist leadership, and he has been stark in saying that the U.S. is engaged in a cold war with Beijing that must be won economically and through democratic values − rather than military might.
North Dakota passed one of the nation's strictest abortion bans that blocks the procedure at all stages of pregnancy after six weeks, with the exceptions for rape, incest and medical emergencies.
And, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, many White House hopefuls on the GOP side have had to answer whether they support Congress establishing a federal ban on abortion, which some conservative voters and candidates have been demanding in recent months.
Burgum told USA TODAY he would not support such a move, however.
"It absolutely belongs to the states," he said. "What would fly in New York would never fly in North Dakota. Those are two very different things."
Former Vice President Mike Pence meets with New Hampshire voters Friday, the latest Republican presidential hopeful to participate in this week’s 2024 town hall forums hosted by Seacoastonline and the USA TODAY Network.
The presidential forums will be held at the historic Exeter Town Hall on Front Street in Exeter, New Hampshire, an iconic location that has long been a favorite of presidential candidates. It's where the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, spoke in March 1860, shortly before launching his successful campaign.
Pence is the first former vice president in modern times to run against the president under whom he served. He will take questions from voters at 3 p.m. Doors open at 2 p.m.
Here are five things to know about Mike Pence ahead of the event.
During most of his four years in the Trump administration, Pence was exceedingly loyal to President Donald Trump, being careful to never steal the spotlight from the president and keeping any disagreements they had out of sight.
That changed on Jan. 6, 2021, when Pence refused to use his ceremonial role overseeing Congress’ acceptance of the nation's electoral college vote to try to overturn the election.
Trump branded him a coward, and Pence’s safety was threatened by rioters storming the Capitol.
Pence has since said Trump’s actions disqualify him for a second shot at the White House.
"I believe that anyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States,” Pence said while launching his campaign in June. “And anyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president of the United States again.”
While Pence entered the race with high name recognition, he argued he was well known but not known well. He’s sought to reintroduce himself to voters as a former Indiana governor and congressman. In the U.S. House, he was a leader among conservatives pushing back on government spending, including a Medicare drug benefit and President George H.W. Bush's signature education bill.
As Indiana governor, Pence pushed through tax cuts and expanded health care through an alternative Medicaid program. He also drew national attention for signing and then backtracking on a bill that critics said would have allowed businesses to deny services to LGBTQ people.
Before being elected to office, Pence was the host of a conservative radio talk show that he called “Rush Limbaugh on decaf.”
Pence regularly tells voters that his fight “for the babies” was his motivation for running for Congress, where he was willing to shut down the federal government in 2011 in an effort to defund Planned Parenthood.
As Indiana’s governor, he signed one of the nation's most restrictive anti-abortion laws. As vice president, he was the Trump administration’s most prominent opponent of abortion.
And as a presidential candidate, he’s criticized Trump and other rivals for not taking a strong enough stance on an issue that Pence said requires “unapologetic leadership.”
He has vowed that he won’t rest or relent “until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the country.” Pence supports a nationwide ban on abortion, as opposed to the state-by-state approach adopted after the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade last year.
Before Pence rode Trump’s populist wave to the White House, his political hero was former President Ronald Reagan. Now that Pence wants to return to Washington as president, he's warning his party that Trump’s populism is a “road to ruin.”
“Will we be the party of conservatism or will we follow the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principles?” Pence said at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in September. "The future of this movement in this party belongs to one or the other - not both.”
Pence is trying to revive Reagan’s “three-legged stool” rubric of uniting social, economic and defense conservatives.
He’s criticized Trump for not being sufficiently conservative on restricting abortion and reforming federal benefits, as well as accusing him of wanting the U.S. to retreat from playing a strong international role.
Pence said that the populist movement in the Republican Party would rather “substitute our faith in limited government and traditional values with an agenda stitched together by little else than personal grievances and performative outrage.” 
Pence has long called himself a “Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.”
He frequently references his faith and has said he can create the conditions for solving the big issues facing the nation by restoring civility in public life.
“It's always been our aspiration to treat others the way we want to be treated, to show that you can take a strong stance on your principles but be respectful of differing viewpoints,” he told USA TODAY.
Democracy, he argues, depends on heavy doses of civility.
“Part of the reason I’m running," he tells voters, "is because I think there’s a real desire across the country for us to elevate the debate."
EXETER, N.H. − Americans need to stand behind Israel − and that includes former President Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said Thursday.
“While we have their back now that they’ve been hit, what’s more important is that we have their back when they hit back,” Haley said at a New Hampshire town hall sponsored by the USA TODAY Network.
The former ambassador to the United Nations said Hamas must be eliminated and “we need to remember who the true backer of all this is – Iran.”
Haley, who served under Trump, also went after her former boss who, at a rally Wednesday, called Hezbollah – an ally of Hamas –“very smart.” And Trump said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “let us down” just before the U.S. killed a top Iranian general in 2020.
Haley said such comments are why it’s time for a new generation of leaders to “leave the negativity and chaos and the baggage” in the past.
“We can’t have someone who is so clouded with the past that they can’t see the future,” she said to whistles and applause. “Donald Trump was the right president at the right time. I don’t think he’s the right president now.”
After strong performances in the first two GOP debates, Haley has jumped in the polls, including in a recent USA TODAY/Boston Globe/Suffolk University survey of likely New Hampshire voters.
She surged ahead of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who lost the standing he once held as the dominant alternative to Trump.
But the 19% of likely New Hampshire voters who backed Haley is still far behind the 49% supporting former President Donald Trump.
Still, Trump has shifted his focus from attacking DeSantis to going after Haley.
Janet Jenkins, a retired teacher from Southbridge, Mass., drove two hours with her husband to Exeter, N.H., to hear Haley speak.
“I just think she has what it takes,” said Jenkins, who has read two of Haley’s books. “I like her demeanor, the way she talks.”
What both Janet and her husband, Bob, most wanted to hear from Haley was how she thinks she can win the nomination.
“Trump is so far ahead,” Bob Jenkins said.
Haley has recently expanded her operations in both Iowa and New Hampshire.
She’s stood out from the field with aggressive debate appearances that included criticizing Trump for adding to the national debt and telling entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.”
In a party that hasn’t unified beyond a position on a national abortion ban, Haley argues the focus should be on areas where Democrats and Republicans can find common ground.
“Stop demonizing this issue,” she said. “We have to humanize it.”
She also went after both parties for not addressing major problems facing the country. Minutes into her remarks, she said her party shares some of the blame for the federal debt.
“You don’t fix Democratic chaos with Republican chaos,” she said later in the town hall. "We need stability. We need focus. We need discipline."
That message appealed to Dixy Scott, 78, an independent from Raymond, N.H., who has been turned off by Republicans since Trump came on the scene.
"She's given me hope," Scott said of Haley.
Sapna Arvind had always dreamed of having a big career in finance.
“My dad, when I was a child, would say, ‘I wanna see you on CNBC,’ "she says. “So I did my undergrad in finance at New York University with those words ringing in my ears.”
Arvind embarked on a career in asset management in New York City after getting an MBA in finance from MIT Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, Massachusetts. By her mid-30s, she was also a mother of two children under the age of 10.
While she’d powered through the early years as a young mother and a professional woman, by the time her younger one was ready for kindergarten, she didn’t want to do it anymore – commuting back to her home in the suburbs at 8 p.m. just as the kids were getting ready for bed.
She decided to quit her job. Her husband, an investment banker, would be the sole breadwinner while she’d be the primary “on-call” parent.
It’s a decision scores of college-educated women have made over the years and which, in part, explains why the gender earnings gap is wider among college-educated women compared with those without a college degree.
In 2022, for example, women with at least a bachelor’s degree earned 79% as much as men who were college graduates, while women who were high school graduates earned 81% as much as men with the same level of education, according to the Pew Research Center.
That is also a topic Harvard professor Claudia Goldin, 77, who received a Nobel Prize in economics for her groundbreaking work on women in the labor market on Monday, has spent decades studying.
After collecting and analyzing 200 years of U.S. historical data to demonstrate how and why gender differences in earnings and employment rates have changed over time, she found that while historically, the wage gap could be explained through differences in education and occupational choices, recently, the differences among men and women in the same profession widens after the birth of the first child.
Goldin’s research also finds this trend: Differences in both pay and the ability to stay in the workforce reflect differences in the division of unpaid caregiving responsibilities between heterosexual couples.
Goldin's recent research has also found that while mothers make less than non-mothers because of the reduced number of hours they work, fathers make more than non-fathers over the course of their careers.
“Quite frankly, it's the most disturbing part of this," Goldin told USA TODAY in a phone interview Tuesday, a day after she won the Nobel prize. "Why is it that fathers are doing better (than non-fathers), even though they have kids? Why is the fatherhood premium growing over time?" she asks, adding that "the price of being a woman stays constant (due to social norms around gender), which is also somewhat disturbing.”
Goldin says women with children enable men with children to achieve more.
“Men are able to step forward because women step backward. It's not simply taking the shirts to the dry cleaner that women do, they are boosting their ability to do work,” Goldin says. “And therefore, if you are by yourself, you don't have the ability to have that help mate.”
The other explanation is the American notion of masculinity that places a self-imposed pressure to achieve more when you are a father.
“This internal sense that fathers have, that they really have to run fast because they are breadwinners,” she says.
When it comes to college-educated women, high-salary jobs with long, inflexible hours exacerbate the gender pay gap. When women take on “greedy” work, which pays disproportionately more when they work a greater number of hours or have less control over those hours, they tend not to last long because they opt out to raise families.
The pandemic, Goldin says had decreased the cost of flexibility as firms and workers have learned to use technologies that enable remote meetings. 
“One of the big hurdles is business travel," she says. "It’s an enormous barrier to individuals with care responsibilities. But “if that job now changed to, you don't have to travel to Tokyo, you have to Zoom with Tokyo clients every other weekend, you can do it.”
Making greedy jobs more flexible would allow more women to take them, Goldin says.
When Jane Vernon moved to the suburbs from New York City with two preschoolers, she worked for a Fortune 500 company that had offered her part-time work during her early days of motherhood.
“What part-time meant was partial pay for nearly full-time work but I made the deal because it allowed me to go to the office three rather than five days per week,” says the Yale graduate and Harvard MBA.
Her hard work didn’t go unnoticed—she was offered a promotion, but the catch was that needed to be physically present five days per week.
“Despite the fact that I had excelled while working ‘part-time’ my hiring boss required face time, being physically present every day of the week, and was not sympathetic to the demands of motherhood, “ Veron says. “She said that juggling family concerns was not relevant.”
She decided to quit her job.
If she’d had flexibility, things would have been very different.
“Without a doubt, I would have stayed in the workforce,” she says. “I did not want to quit my job.”
Her life as a Scarsdale mom, one of the most expensive zip codes in the country, landed her in familiar company: stay-at-home moms with degrees from prestigious universities and experience in the corporate world, including at white-shoe law firms, exclusive management consultancies and Fortune 500 companies.
Vernon established The Acceleration Project, a nonprofit consulting firm in 2012 to help small businesses that were dealing with the aftermath of the economic recession by channeling the talents of these “opt-out” moms with expertise in everything from law, business marketing and finance.
The nonprofit now has more than 200 volunteers who work part-time or full-time with the organization.
"While TAP started with moms who left their fast-paced careers, more of consultants hold full or part-time jobs," says Veron. "They say they choose to work with us as we provide opportunities for professionals to use their skills for meaningful impact."
Carol Fishman Cohen, a Pomona College and Harvard Business School graduate, took an 11-year break in the 1990s to raise her four children in a Boston suburb before going back to work full-time at Bain Capital.
In Cohen’s case, her husband had been working at a law firm for 20 years when she was going back to work. He had a demanding job but had little travel. This, and the fact that she had a nanny to take care of her children ages 5 to 11, enabled her to return to a high-pressure job that required travel.
“My husband handled things like doctor visits, sick kids, and unexpected events,” she says.
When considering childcare costs, couples should evaluate being able to afford childcare based on their combined projected income, not based on the incremental income the returning partner is making.
“Because initially, it can be a breakeven situation. However, this is temporary and an investment in the more profitable years to come,” she says. 
She is now the founder and CEO of career reentry firm iRelaunch, which produces the iRelaunch Return to Work Conferences and works with companies on career reentry programs.
The share of prime-age women who are employed hit an all-time high of 76% in June and experts believe the flexibility to work remotely contributed to the surge.
In June, 77.8% of women ages 25 to 54 were working or looking for jobs, up from 77.6% in May and the highest in U.S. history, the Labor Department’s July jobs report showed.
About 35% of people who can do their jobs remotely are working from home, up from just 7% before the pandemic, according to the Pew Research Center.
It depends, given that we are seeing various degrees of in-office requirements, says Cohen.
“In the past, we saw expectations of ‘facetime' in the office, 24/7 accountability and ‘spontaneous travel,’ meaning jumping on a plane with little or no notice, drive out female professionals disproportionately from finance roles that were fast-paced and transactional,” she says. “Less travel enabled by video calls is a huge factor in retaining mothers - and some fathers too.”
Goldin says couple equity, where each would share the “on-call at home” duties and each could also achieve in their career, would help narrow the gap. That would entail leaving a lot of money on the table, as each passes up the high pressure promotion, partner track or tenure track. 
Arvind, who quit her job as a vice president in asset management at Alliance Bernstein when her older son was nine, says mothering while working was an “emotional rollercoaster.”
“I'd feel so guilty. Like, they would call from school, and I'd be like, ‘Sorry, I'm in a meeting,” she says. “I felt the call to parent even more when they were in elementary and middle school when they’d bring back so much stuff .... mental and social stuff that I just couldn't solve in the moment. I felt like I was always trying to catch up.”
But staying at home wasn’t easy.“Every three months I go through this existential angst about what am I doing with my skillset," she says. "I don't want to be doing nothing. I don't want to be called just a housewife. I want to have a title that says I'm not just mom and wife.”
After four years of mulling over how her life had "devolved into nothingness," and looking for and giving up on part-time jobs in finance in Westchester, Arvind decided to expand her skillset and pivot from finance to education.
She went back to school for a master's degree in economics and education at Columbia Teacher’s College (taking more courses than required for her degree) and now works as a consultant at a firm that maps and analyzes the prenatal to five funding streams with various state governments. She also serves on the board of Child Care Council of Westchester.
The consultant job offers flexibility and is a remote position. Eventually, she hopes to get back into finance as a venture capitalist in the education-tech field.
Asked if the earnings gap would further narrow or even disappear in the future, Goldin says she’s terrible with predictions.
“I’m not very good at looking into the future. I’ve been wrong about every piece of device that has appeared, including the cell phone."
Laughing, she says she nailed one prediction: the Barbie movie.
"I said, this is going to be really, really, really big.”

People on Social Security will receive a much smaller bump of 3.2% in their benefits checks next year, as the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, after government data on Thursday showed inflation steadied in September from the prior month.
Annual inflation was 3.7% in September, matching August’s increase but off a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Without the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called “core” inflation rate fell to 4.1% from August’s 4.3%. 
Although inflation remains about double the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, it remains mostly lower, which means Social Security recipients will see a lower COLA.
The 3.2% increase in 2024 is about one-third of the four-decade-high 8.7% COLA in 2023. And while the hike in benefits remains higher than the 2.6% average over the past 20 years, older adults are pessimistic about their finances and the growing possibility of Social Security benefit cuts, according to the latest retirement survey of 2,258 people by The Senior Citizens League, a nonprofit seniors group. 
Protect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023
“Worry that retirement income won’t be enough to cover the cost of essentials in the coming months is a top concern of 56% of survey respondents,” said Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst at The Senior Citizens League, in a release. “Social Security benefit cuts are an even bigger concern.” 
Various reasons the COLA is falling short include: 
◾ Inflation: 68% of older adults say their household expenses remain at least 10% higher than one year ago, although the overall inflation rate has slowed, according to the League’s survey. They said this situation has persisted over the last year. 
◾ Benefit cuts: Nearly 6 out of 10 respondents rank this as their top worry. “Significant numbers of lower-income older households have lost access to some safety net programs over the past 12 months,” Johnson said.  
Some faced a double whammy. The 5.9% and 8.7% COLAs in 2022 and 2023, respectively, boosted incomes just enough to make some ineligible for low-income assistance programs such as supplemental nutrition assistance program, or SNAP (food stamps) and rental assistance, and federal emergency COVID-19 assistance for SNAP and Medicaid ended earlier this year. 
◾ Taxes: Because Social Security recipients received the highest COLA in 40 years in 2023, Johnson expects more beneficiaries to owe federal income taxes on their Social Security benefits for the first time in the upcoming 2024 tax season.  
Up to 85% of Social Security benefits can be counted as taxable income when income exceeds certain thresholds. Unlike other parts of the federal income tax code, the income thresholds that subject Social Security benefits to taxation have never been adjusted for inflation. So, as Social Security income increases due to COLAs, both the number of retirees subject to taxation of benefits and the portion of benefits that may be taxable rise.

A few states want some too:These states want a cut of your Social Security check. Do you live in one of them?
Congress could pass legislation to allow income tax thresholds for taxing Social Security to be adjusted annually for inflation, the same way the IRS adjusts tax brackets. 
Here’s an example of what that might mean for someone: 
◾ Current law says if an individual’s income is between $25,000 and $34,000, you may have to pay income tax on up to 50% of benefits, and if it’s more than $34,000, up to 85% of benefits may be taxable. 
◾ If those thresholds were adjusted for inflation to 2023 dollars, then the individual filing status of $25,000 would be about $74,614, and $34,000 would be about $101,475, Johnson said. 
Congress also could change how the COLA is calculated to better reflect how seniors spend their money.  
“If that was the law today, the COLA in 2024 would be higher – about 4.2%,” Johnson estimates, using the government’s consumer price index for the elderly.  
Social Security Administration bases its COLA each year on average annual increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from July through September. The index for urban wage earners largely reflects the broad index that the Labor Department releases each month but differs slightly. Last month, while the index remained at 3.7%, the index for urban wage earners was 3.6%.   
The Seniors Citizens League uses the most recent inflation data to keep a running projection of what COLA might be next year. September is particularly important because it makes up the final month SSA officially uses to calculate 2024’s COLA. 
About 70 million Americans receive benefits from programs administered by SSA, with retired workers and their dependents accounting for 76.9% of benefits paid in 2022.    
Nearly 9 out of 10 people aged 65 and older received a Social Security benefit as of Dec. 31. Among them, 12% of men and 15% of women rely on Social Security for 90% or more of their income.   
In August, the average monthly check for Social Security beneficiaries was $1,705.79, according to SSA. A 3.2% COLA would mean about an extra $54.58 each month.   
The new COLA will be effective starting in January.

The United Auto Workers’ strikes came to Louisville, Kentucky, this week when the 8,700 workers at the Ford Kentucky Truck Plant held a surprise walkout. They join the 25,300 employees now on strike at other Big Three facilities across the country.
And the movement they’re leading is gaining momentum – the strikes are popular with the public and infectious with workers. They’re drawing on the energy of recent labor efforts at Starbucks, UPS, Hollywood and elsewhere. And in the UAW’s case, they’ve struck a chord by calling out eroding compensation and unjust transitions that have harmed production workers across the economy in recent decades.
Now the members of Louisville’s UAW Local 862 could help shape the outcome of these negotiations. The Local says its members are responsible for 54% of Ford’s North American profits, including through the production of SUVs and Super Duty pickups. 
Ford is now a special target of UAW after some progress in negotiations with General Motors, which recently conceded to putting new electric vehicle and battery manufacturing facilities under the master UAW contract.
The need for good union jobs in the transition to EV production at Ford and Stellantis is still one of the major sticking points in the negotiations. 
Not coincidentally, on the same day the Louisville truck plant workers hit the bricks, Ford BlueOval SK battery facilities under construction in Kentucky and Tennessee announced a starting salary increase for their not-yet-union job openings. Solidarity is contagious, and these corporations are worried.  
That’s why the Big Three are starting to make other concessions as well.
A deal may be closer than we think:UAW strike talks show progress with Ford, Stellantis
That includes over 20% wage increases, agreements to bring back cost-of-living adjustments that had disappeared in recent years and a shorter path for workers to reach top wage rates. But along with the need for a full just transition to EV jobs, the companies’ wage proposals fall short after years of failing to keep up with inflation and in the context of soaring CEO pay. And the UAW is rightly calling for an end to employment tiers that have denied pensions to workers hired after 2007.
I got to hear directly from UAW President Shawn Fain last week at a policy conference in Detroit. Fain grew up in Indiana as the grandson of unionized auto workers who moved there from Kentucky and Tennessee.
His refrain is common sense: These corporations have never been more profitable, and “record profits must mean record contracts.”
Trump doesn't have union's back:In UAW strike, Trump pretends to support workers. He's used to stabbing them in the back.
Auto workers made huge sacrifices when the Big Three nearly failed after the Great Recession, and it’s past time that the workers share in the industry’s tremendous gains.
But Fain is also unflinching in his vision that the UAW’s fight is about the future of the broader American economy. We’ll either continue on the path that enriches billionaires and squeezes the working class, or we’ll build something better. To the plutocrats claiming that the UAW aims to wreck the economy, Fain clarifies that they only aim to wreck “their economy.”
Now these Louisville workers are joining the growing picket line, and marching for a place in history.

From getting stuck in traffic and the extra effort put into getting dressed, many employees would much rather clock in from home. However, a recent survey found that one of the biggest reasons could simply be how costly it is to make money.
Owl Lab's 2023 "State of Work" report found 66% of U.S. employees who returned to the office to work five days a week or full time, spend an average of $51 every workday.
“There’s no question” about whether working in-person is “wildly more expensive” today than it was before the pandemic, the videoconferencing company's CEO Frank Weishaupt told CNBC.
How long does retirement last?Most American men don't seem to know
Working in the office costs pet owners an extra $20 a day on average, the report states.
The report also states that 49% of workers feel it's easier to maintain a work life balance with a remote job while 31% believe it's easier with a hybrid and only 20% at the office.
The survey shares information on what work tasks are easier to complete during a remote shift, what perks exist at the office and which work models managers feel their teams better thrive in.
The report found that employees working at the office pay about $51 a day on the following expenses:
Your connection with your coworkers can often make or break a job.
Owl Labs found that 46% of employees find it easier to build colleague relationships when working from home. 23% found doing so harder with a remote job while 26% said it made no difference whether they saw their fellow staff in-person or not.
Does remote work increase anxiety?For parents, work from home may hurt mental health
Between August and September 2022, around 27% of the U.S. workforce worked remotely at least part-time, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Multiple academic servers suggested that actually about half of Americans worked remotely at least part-time, the MIT Sloan School of Management reported in June.
The workplace doesn’t look like it did four years ago, namely because of the lack of the “workplace” itself. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers were more likely to work from home in 2022 than in 2019, with 34% of employees doing all or some of their work at home. 
The “American Time Use” survey also found for full-time workers, men worked an average of 8.3 hours per day and women 7.8 hours.
Here’s a glimpse at the American work year in numbers: 
There are about 2,080 working hours in a year for an employee who works a traditional 40-hour workweek. The average employee works around 8 hours per weekday, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you multiply a week's worth of work by the 52 weeks in a year, you get 2,080 hours.
That number doesn’t include holidays or paid time off, however. There are 11 federal holidays recognized by the U.S. government. Federal employees have all 11 off, and if you’re lucky enough to receive the same benefit, you’ll get an extra 88 hours off your annual tally. 
U.S. employees receive an average of 7.6 paid holidays per year, according to a Forbes survey, with the most common being Thanksgiving, Christmas, Independence Day, New Year’s Day, Memorial Day and Labor Day.  
The mystery of Presidents Day:Not every state celebrates the same. We found out why.
For a traditional five-day workweek, there are 260 working days in a year. Without accounting for time off, that means you spend approximately 71% of your year working. 
Subtract however many federal holidays your company allows (and the vacation time you’re planning) and that’s how many working days you’ll have this year. 
With 365 days in a year and 24 hours in a day, there are 8,760 total hours in a year.

Though different people experience attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in different ways, it is something that can significantly disrupt a person's life. Whether in the classroom, workplace, or at home, ADHD has been shown to affect grades, job performance and can even cause relationship problems.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders among children, but it's also known to be common among people 18 and older. 
It's a disorder that many have learned to live with every day, explains Wan-Ling Tseng, PhD, an assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine. They've done so through behavioral therapy or by adopting coping mechanisms.
In many cases, medication is also prescribed to improve focus and ease ADHD symptoms. "There are many effective, evidence-supported medical and non-medical treatments and other supports for ADHD across the lifespan," says J. Russell Ramsay, PhD, a licensed psychologist and retired professor of clinical psychology with the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine
ADHD is a chronic neurodevelopmental condition (referring to the way one's brain grows and develops) that "is characterized by difficulties with inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity or both," explains Emma Hepburn, PhD, a clinical psychologist and author of "A Toolkit For Your Emotions." 
Though many people refer to ADHD and ADD (attention-deficit disorder) as separate conditions, they are mostly identical, so the term ADD is simply an outdated reference to ADHD, according to the Child Mind Institute. (One distinction between the two that some people point to is that some individuals with ADHD have hyperactive behaviors while others don't, but medically, the diagnosis is labeled ADHD either way.)
Symptoms of ADHD can "cause impairments in multiple life settings," Ramsay says.
Though it's considered more common in children, with at least 6.1 million kids in the U.S. between the ages of 2-17 living with the condition, per the CDC, it's also common in adulthood. "6.8% of adults around the world have ADHD," says Ramsay.
Indeed, childhood ADHD symptoms often persist into adulthood with such traits "usually consistent with one's age and development level," explains Tseng.
The symptoms of ADHD are pretty straightforward and include inattention - an inability to concentrate or focus; hyperactivity - frequent movements not fitting to the setting; and impulsivity - sudden actions that occur without thinking them through. 
These symptoms can manifest as a person seeming to daydream a lot, forgetting or losing things often, talking or interrupting a lot, having a tendency to squirm or fidget, or having a hard time resisting temptation, per the CDC. Tseng adds that a person with ADHD might also "have trouble following through on instructions, finishing tasks, or trouble with organizing thoughts," and/or "trouble waiting their turn."
It's also important to note: "Some people may experience more inattentive symptoms while others experience more hyperactive/impulsive symptoms," says Hepburn. She adds that such traits may also change over time as a person develops or circumstances change. 
Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this story misstated the price of Steve Jobs' Birkenstocks, which sold at an auction in November 2022.
Birkenstock has gone public.
Birkenstock Holding Ltd. sold about 10.8 million shares in the offering, its shareholders selling an additional 21.5 million. The German sandal company raised about $495 million, the Associated Press reported.
Birkenstock sandals came to the U.S. in the mid-1960s – today, they're a staple of comfort and style. But the shoe has, in part, come into mainstream footwear because of its emphasis on foot health over fashion. They're sometimes referred to as “Jesus sandals," not because of the water-friendly options that allow you to (partially) walk on water but because of a signature B.C.-era style. Even the designer credited with popularizing them in the U.S. called them “odd-looking sandals.”
Here's a look back on the sandal from its family shoemaker beginnings to its place in modern-day fashion.
The story of the iconic sandal goes like this, according to the history and heritage section of Birkenstock's website: The modern-day Birkenstock has roots in an 18th-century family shoemaking dynasty – the earliest mention of the shoemaker Johannes Birkenstock is from 1774. Generations later, Konrad Birkenstock designed a unique anatomical shoe featuring a rounded heel, malleable sole and different left and right feet, allowing the foot to roll. He sold flexible footbed insoles and contoured arch support. 
His son launched the physician-endorsed “System Birkenstock” in 1932, a series of podiatry and specialist courses with an accompanying podiatry textbook in 1947. It was here that Carl Birkenstock laid out his plans to design a shoe based on the concept of “Naturgewolltes Gehen” or natural walking. His son, Karl Birkenstock, created the original “footbed sandal” with a flexible base and adjustable strap.
It was a time when stilettos were all the rage, and the first launch of the “Madrid” shoe at the 1963 shoe trade fair in Düsseldorf failed. They were the “laughingstock” of the fair, Karl Birkenstock said. 
He pivoted and distributed pamphlets to doctors to drum up support for his sandals. Berlin-born American designer Margot Fraser, who suffered from foot pain, found her antidote in Birkenstocks while on a trip to Germany. Fraser brought Birkenstocks to the U.S. in 1966 and secured distribution rights to sell them in California by 1972. 
From there, American popularity spread thanks to a loyal fan base of Northern California hippies, the Los Angeles Times reported. Birkenstocks were originally sold in health stores because of mainstream retail skepticism.
Apple founder Steve Jobs famously loved the sandals around this time. A “well-used” pair of brown suede Birkenstocks from the mid-1970s sold for nearly $220,000 at an auction in November 2022. It was the highest price ever paid for a pair of sandals. 
Buying stocks for the first time?:How to navigate the market for first-time investors
During its early years (and perhaps even now), the words “Birkenstocks” and “ugly” went hand-in-hand.
“In the 1950s and 1960s, really design was heavily based on aesthetics over necessarily the function of the shoes,” says Liz Tregenza, a fashion historian, in Birkenstock’s 2022 “Ugly for a Reason” documentary series. “It was really about ... creating a total look and I think comfort had a secondary place.”
But the hippie and grunge circles quickly embraced the shoe as a symbol of counterculture. In 1992, Marc Jacobs drew inspiration from this and styled Tyra Banks in Arizona Birkenstock sandals in the infamous show that got him fired from Perry Ellis.
This wouldn't be the last time Birkenstocks appeared in high fashion. The 2012 Céline collection morphed them into what’s since been referred to as “Furkenstocks,” an adapted Arizona sandal lined with mink, Vogue India reports. Dior has a collection with them.
Heidi Klum even designed her own line of bejeweled Birkenstocks.
But even as the decades roll on, they’ve been called the “Jesus sandals,” deemed geeky and hallmarks of hipster culture. They’ve even been the subject of the hot socks and sandals debate – just see the “Socks and Sandals” jingle from Disney Channel’s “So Random!” 
But since COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, today's styles place a greater emphasis on comfort. Birkenstocks are worn by celebrities and spotted in viral TikTok styling videos. They’re now part of a “cool girl” aesthetic. Margot Robbie even traded her pink heels in for a pair of them in the 2023 “Barbie” movie, though with great reluctance. 
Birkenstock sandals are made at the company’s production facilities in Germany and the brand’s closed-toed shoes are made in Portugal. The four German factories are located in Bernstadt, Görlitz, Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse.
An IPO is an initial public offering – you can think of it as a fundraising effort. 
When a company is private, the shareholders often include comprised of founders, family, friends and professional investors, according to Investopedia. When a company goes public, it means they’re offering shares to the public for the first time, allowing the company to grow and public investors a front-row seat.
After going public, a company is subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
What to expect:Stock market outlook for 2024
Birkenstock's IPO comes two years after it was acquired by private equity firm L Catterton and the investment company of Bernard Arnault, the billionaire owner of the LVMH conglomerate. 
Birkenstock is valuing the company at $8.46 billion, the Associated Press reported. The stock opened at $41 each and ended the day down 12.6%.
Birkenstock sales boosted this year in part because of the Barbie movie’s use of the famous sandal. Bloomberg News reported a 29% rise in revenue last year. 
Many adults have worries when it comes to their sleep. The focus ranges from sleep hygiene to wanting to fall asleep faster and even coping with sleep apnea. For others, the prospect of bedtime comes with a frightening – and often recurring – condition of being temporarily unable to move at night, a state of being known as sleep paralysis.
While prevalence varies (one study found it in as many as 38% of participants) researchers believe that generally, about 20% of people experience sleep paralysis at some point in their life. Whether you've experienced this sensation once, or do so frequently, it's important to understand what sleep paralysis is, what causes sleep paralysis and what options there are for sleep paralysis treatment.
Sleep paralysis is "a condition where you feel paralyzed just before falling asleep or, more commonly, when you first wake up in the morning," says Kevin Walker, MD, the medical director of Intermountain Health Sleep Disorders Center in Utah. It most often occurs between stages of wakefulness and sleep when, for a very brief period of time, a person may be unable to move or speak.  
Sleep paralysis symptoms vary. During sleep paralysis, a person may also find it difficult to take deep breaths or feel like their chest is constricted. A tendency to hallucinate has also been associated with the condition. Colloquially, these hallucinations may be referred to as “sleep paralysis demons.”
While the exact cause of sleep paralysis remains unknown, experts say there are often multiple contributing factors or disorders involved, including insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep apnea, substance abuse and sudden changes to one's sleeping schedule. Most commonly though, sleep paralysis is merely a continuation of what occurs naturally in one's body during sleep. 
"When we go into a dreaming state of sleep at night (REM), our body has a mechanism that paralyzes our muscles, which is a great thing so that we don’t act out our dreams," Walker explains. "We often dream more the second half of the night, including just before we wake up, so sleep paralysis is thought to be a carry-over of this REM sleep-related paralysis into wakefulness."
As such, sleep paralysis can happen to anyone but may also be triggered by other factors. "Sleep paralysis can happen when a person is sleep deprived and is more common in people with other sleep disorders," says Melissa Lipford, M.D., a neurologist at Mayo Clinic, Rochester. 
While startling and even frightening for some people, sleep paralysis is not harmful and should pass quickly. Still, because the condition is alarming to children and adults alike, it has been linked with heightened cases of anxiety and increased stress at home, school or work. 
"The most important strategy is to tell yourself this is a temporary experience and will be over soon," says Lipford. "Most individuals will then drift back off to sleep and wake up with no issues." She also suggests making small movements of one's fingers or toes and taking slow breaths to recover more quickly.
"Although it may feel like an eternity while you're going through it," Walker says, "your body will naturally come out of sleep paralysis." He says one's body, "typically self resolves sleep paralysis within seconds to a few minutes at the most." 
The best way to avoid sleep paralysis altogether is to "keep a regular sleep schedule and get an adequate amount of sleep consistently," Walker says. Doing so includes straightforward practices such as avoiding caffeine, large meals (or late-night snacking) before bed and putting away screens prior to bedtime to reduce stimulating blue-light exposure. "Only go to bed when drowsy and minimize time in bed awake," Walker suggests. 
Lipford reassures that episodes of sleep paralysis aren't anything to panic over, but should be discussed with a physician if the condition seems to persist. 
"Sleep paralysis is usually not a serious health concern," she says, "but if you experience the symptom frequently, speak to your healthcare provider to evaluate for other underlying sleep disorders or medical conditions that can contribute."  
The United Auto Workers’ strikes came to Louisville, Kentucky, this week when the 8,700 workers at the Ford Kentucky Truck Plant held a surprise walkout. They join the 25,300 employees now on strike at other Big Three facilities across the country.
And the movement they’re leading is gaining momentum – the strikes are popular with the public and infectious with workers. They’re drawing on the energy of recent labor efforts at Starbucks, UPS, Hollywood and elsewhere. And in the UAW’s case, they’ve struck a chord by calling out eroding compensation and unjust transitions that have harmed production workers across the economy in recent decades.
Now the members of Louisville’s UAW Local 862 could help shape the outcome of these negotiations. The Local says its members are responsible for 54% of Ford’s North American profits, including through the production of SUVs and Super Duty pickups. 
Ford is now a special target of UAW after some progress in negotiations with General Motors, which recently conceded to putting new electric vehicle and battery manufacturing facilities under the master UAW contract.
The need for good union jobs in the transition to EV production at Ford and Stellantis is still one of the major sticking points in the negotiations. 
Not coincidentally, on the same day the Louisville truck plant workers hit the bricks, Ford BlueOval SK battery facilities under construction in Kentucky and Tennessee announced a starting salary increase for their not-yet-union job openings. Solidarity is contagious, and these corporations are worried.  
That’s why the Big Three are starting to make other concessions as well.

That includes over 20% wage increases, agreements to bring back cost-of-living adjustments that had disappeared in recent years and a shorter path for workers to reach top wage rates. But along with the need for a full just transition to EV jobs, the companies’ wage proposals fall short after years of failing to keep up with inflation and in the context of soaring CEO pay.

Former president and current criminal defendant Donald Trump, the front-runner in the GOP presidential primary, is getting worse.
I realize that’s a mighty high bar for him to clear, but he’s doing it, each day showing independent voters and Republicans who still value sane leadership why he should never be allowed within 10 square miles of the White House.
In the wake of the hideous Hamas attack on Israel, with American lawmakers and both sides of the aisle pledging full support for our ally, Trump’s political instincts told him to slam Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and say: “Israel was not prepared.”
Trump then praised the terrorist organization Hezbollah, which on Wednesday was attacking Israel along its northern border. 
“You know, Hezbollah is very smart,” Trump said. “They’re all very smart.”
MAGA loyalists’ minds won’t be changed by anything, but those voters also won’t be enough, should Trump win the GOP nomination, to get him back into office. He’ll need to win over independents and even some moderate Republicans who put country over party while making headway with the ever-growing number of Generation Z voters who, based on recent elections, broadly reject Trump's MAGA movement.
How is he going to do all that when he's running around the country insulting an ally reeling from an unspeakable terror attack and generally sounding like his brain has turned to oatmeal?
After horrific Hamas attack on Israel,Biden acts presidential while Republicans act like fools.
Consider an assortment of baffling/disturbing comments Trump has made in speeches and on social media just in recent weeks.
He has repeatedly misidentified President Joe Biden as former President Barack Obama, recently saying at a rally “you take a look at Obama and look at some of the things he’s done” and then, in an interview this week about Biden’s response to the attack on Israel, saying, “It’s all coming through Iran, and Obama, he doesn’t want to talk about it. ... He doesn’t even mention them in a statement.”
The Fox News interviewer had to correct him afterward.
In another recent interview, Trump said: “We have the worst education almost in the large world, the world that people know about.” As opposed to the large world people don’t know about?
He said at a rally that the U.S. Capitol “looks like sh-t.”
Referring to Jeb Bush, Trump said: “He got us into the Middle East. How did that work out?” It was President George W. Bush who “got us into the Middle East.”
In a Sept. 15 speech in Washington, D.C., Trump suggested Biden will lead America into World War II, which ended in 1945: “We have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president in the history of our country, who is cognitively impaired, in no condition to lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war. Just think of it, we would be in World War II very quickly if we’re going to be relying on this man.”
When questioning someone’s lucidity, it’s generally best to sound lucid yourself.
Late last month at a rally, Trump mocked Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her husband, who was brutally attacked and beaten in their home last year.
“We’ll stand up to crazy Nancy Pelosi, who ruined San Francisco – how’s her husband doing, anybody know?” Trump said as the crowd laughed. “And she’s against building a wall at our border, even though she has a wall around her house – which obviously didn’t do a very good job.” 
Biden is too old.And so is Trump. As a Gen Z voter, I want younger candidates.
Speaking of immigrants, Trump said in an interview earlier this month: “It is a very sad thing for our country. It’s poisoning the blood of our country.”
That language mirrors lines in Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” and is in line with the way white supremacists discuss immigrants.
Trump has said recently that forest fires could be prevented “if you dampen your forests.”
He said anyone who robs a store should be shot – “If you rob a store you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store. Shot!”
And in a Florida speech this week, he went on this rant (I’ve used all-caps and phonetic spelling to illustrate the pronunciation of words he loudly emphasized): “Instead of keeping terrorists and terrorist sympathizers out of America, the Biden administration is inviting them in. You know why, because he’s got a boss. Who’s his boss? Barack HOO-SANE Obama. Barack Hoo-sane Obama. You remember the great Rush Limbaugh, Barack Hoo-SANE Obama. He’d go, Barack Hoo-SANE Obama.”
Petty criticism of Israel (Trump remains mad at Netanyahu because the prime minister accepted that Biden won the 2020 election), violent rhetoric, mixing up the names of political rivals, mocking an attack on a lawmaker’s spouse and generally sounding like the town drunk slouched at the end of the bar airing conspiratorial grievances. And that’s only a small sample of Trump’s madness over the past few weeks.
Setting aside his two impeachments, his incitement of an attack on the U.S. Capitol, his election denialism and the 91 state and federal felony charges he faces, I have to ask independents and on-the-fence Republicans alike: Would you actually vote for that mess? Is that really the best the Republican Party can offer America and the world?
People will keep taking swipes at Biden’s age, though Trump is only three years younger. But if you listen and pay attention to the former president, you’ll see a profoundly unhinged man teetering on a full separation from reality.
The ham has slipped off his sandwich. It’s time to stop pretending otherwise.

Ever since USA TODAY broke the news last month about Michigan State University’s investigation into Mel Tucker’s alleged sexual misconduct, the former football coach has been playing defense.   
Statements from Tucker or his legal team have vehemently denied allegations he sexually harassed Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor and activist the coach had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence. The alleged harassment – an April 2022 phone call with Tracy during which Tucker masturbated and is accused of making sexual comments without her consent – was not harassment at all, according to Tucker.
While he has admitted to masturbating during the call, Tucker claims it was consensual phone sex.   
No matter what happened in that phone call, Tucker’s public behavior since then has gone well beyond just denying sexually harassing Tracy.
In his first public statement addressing MSU’s investigation into his alleged sexual misconduct, Tucker went on the attack. He accused Tracy of fabricating the harassment to “revive her career” and “destroy” his life, and called the allegations “character assassination.”
Other swipes at Tracy are sprinkled throughout the rest of the statement: Tucker implied she provoked him into having phone sex (and blames her for neither objecting nor hanging up the phone), claimed she spread rumors about his marriage, and propped up the idea that Tracy was motivated by greed.   
In a second statement following news that MSU was planning on firing the coach, Tucker repeated his claim that Tracy had made false allegations and called the investigation into his alleged misconduct a “miscarriage of justice,” a sentiment that appeared again in Tucker’s 25-page response from his legal team to MSU’s notice of termination.
Tucker has insisted that Tracy is untrustworthy, and that he is the real victim of this situation by using a common tactic called DARVO. It’s an acronym that stands for deny, attack, reverse victim and offender. Perpetrators of wrongdoing – especially those who commit sexual misconduct – often use it to deflect blame and responsibility. It never happened, she’s lying, I’m being falsely accused.   
Surviving sexual assault:President Biden's Title IX promise to survivors is overdue. We can't wait on Washington's chaos to end.
In his statements, Tucker has checked all the DARVO boxes: He has denied any wrongdoing, attacked the alleged victim (as well as the investigative process), and adopted a victimized role while portraying the alleged victim as the real wrongdoer.
Even Tracy herself noticed his use of this tactic. In a post to social media, the sexual assault survivor and activist called his initial response “just more of the same DARVO.”     
We are psychology researchers who first named this response (Jennifer J. Freyd in 1997) and continue to study the tactic. Our research on DARVO finds it is a common tactic that can influence people’s perceptions in ways that favor perpetrators.
People who are exposed to a perpetrator’s DARVO responses are more likely to find victims less credible and perpetrators less responsible for the wrongdoing they committed. Whether Tucker is guilty or not guilty of what Tracy has alleged, DARVO itself is harmful. It promotes victim blaming and prevents thoughtful discussions of sexual violence from happening.  
In cases of sexual violence, DARVO capitalizes on common misconceptions. If it were really harassment, she would have just hung up, she would have said something, she would have reported it sooner.
In reality, people who are subjected to sexual violence often do not conform to stereotypical ideas about how victims should respond. For instance, many victims “freeze” while experiencing sexual harassment. But for those who subscribe to incorrect assumptions about how people respond to sexual violence, DARVO appears to make a compelling argument.   
Outdated statutes of limitations:E. Jean Carroll lawsuit against Trump shows why Adult Survivors Act is needed
DARVO is a venomous response that seeks to silence victims, confuse observers and empower perpetrators. And when a prominent public figure like Tucker amplifies DARVO, its legitimacy and cultural contagion are boosted. She’s lying, just like that woman who falsely accused Mel Tucker. Happens all the time.   
That’s why it’s important to identify and name DARVO when it happens. Research tells us that DARVO is less likely to influence observers’ perceptions when they are educated about this tactic. In other words, knowing about DARVO renders it a less effective tool.
When Tracy called attention to Tucker’s use of DARVO, she contained this disorienting tactic into a more understandable package. His denials, attacks and victim-playing make more sense – and are potentially less impactful – when viewed through the lens of DARVO.   
Perhaps it was an awareness of his DARVO responses that contributed to MSU’s decision to fire Tucker. In its termination letter to the coach, the university called attention to his “unconvincing rationalizations and misguided attempts to shift responsibility.”
By rejecting the narrative Tucker had promoted, the university made a decisive statement against victim-blaming tactics like DARVO. Which, in the shadow of MSU’s initial failure to stop former employee and convicted sex offender Larry Nassar, is a move in the right direction.   
Tucker’s DARVO defense was ultimately a bad play. It was ineffective in helping him retain his job, and it injected more victim-blaming sentiment into a cultural landscape already hostile toward people who experience and report sexual violence.
Tucker didn’t have to resort to DARVO to defend himself; he might have easily offered that, from his perspective, he did not engage in sexually harassing behaviors – and he could have left it at that. The attacks and attempts to portray himself as the victim of malicious false allegations were a toxic and unnecessary addition.   
DARVO has always been bad for victims, and it has always been counter to the prevention of sexual violence. But, with enough awareness and education about this destructive tactic, its power and frequent use can be curbed.

The first school resource officer came into existence in the late 1950s under the guise that having a police officer in the school would "improve" the relationship between youth and law enforcement – a novel claim that helped SRO programs multiply. It's estimated that 20% of schools have an officer.
Yet, despite this original claim that relationships with the youth would improve, there has not been any conclusive evidence that an officer presence improves youth relationships with law enforcement. In fact, the research is quite mixed. 
Though different people experience attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in different ways, it is something that can significantly disrupt a person's life. Whether in the classroom, workplace, or at home, ADHD has been shown to affect grades, job performance and can even cause relationship problems.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders among children, but it's also known to be common among people 18 and older. 
It's a disorder that many have learned to live with every day, explains Wan-Ling Tseng, PhD, an assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine. They've done so through behavioral therapy or by adopting coping mechanisms.
In many cases, medication is also prescribed to improve focus and ease ADHD symptoms. "There are many effective, evidence-supported medical and non-medical treatments and other supports for ADHD across the lifespan," says J. Russell Ramsay, PhD, a licensed psychologist and retired professor of clinical psychology with the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine
ADHD is a chronic neurodevelopmental condition (referring to the way one's brain grows and develops) that "is characterized by difficulties with inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity or both," explains Emma Hepburn, PhD, a clinical psychologist and author of "A Toolkit For Your Emotions." 
Though many people refer to ADHD and ADD (attention-deficit disorder) as separate conditions, they are mostly identical, so the term ADD is simply an outdated reference to ADHD, according to the Child Mind Institute. (One distinction between the two that some people point to is that some individuals with ADHD have hyperactive behaviors while others don't, but medically, the diagnosis is labeled ADHD either way.)
Symptoms of ADHD can "cause impairments in multiple life settings," Ramsay says.
Though it's considered more common in children, with at least 6.1 million kids in the U.S. between the ages of 2-17 living with the condition, per the CDC, it's also common in adulthood. "6.8% of adults around the world have ADHD," says Ramsay.
Indeed, childhood ADHD symptoms often persist into adulthood with such traits "usually consistent with one's age and development level," explains Tseng.
The symptoms of ADHD are pretty straightforward and include inattention - an inability to concentrate or focus; hyperactivity - frequent movements not fitting to the setting; and impulsivity - sudden actions that occur without thinking them through. 
These symptoms can manifest as a person seeming to daydream a lot, forgetting or losing things often, talking or interrupting a lot, having a tendency to squirm or fidget, or having a hard time resisting temptation, per the CDC. Tseng adds that a person with ADHD might also "have trouble following through on instructions, finishing tasks, or trouble with organizing thoughts," and/or "trouble waiting their turn."
It's also important to note: "Some people may experience more inattentive symptoms while others experience more hyperactive/impulsive symptoms," says Hepburn. She adds that such traits may also change over time as a person develops or circumstances change. 
You know you're not going to win. Still, you can't help but buy a ticket. Why?
The Powerball is making headlines once again after the winning ticket was sold in California Wednesday for the whopping $1.76 billion jackpot.
It's a hefty prize, but the odds of winning, as with most lotteries, were astronomically small − about 1 in 292.2 million. For context, you're more likely to get killed by a shark, fatally hit by a meteor or struck by lightning.
You're also more likely to worsen your mental health in the process of playing the lottery, experts say.
"If you're struggling with your bills and you're looking to make the money through buying scratchers or playing the lottery, and you lose that money, it's money that you really can't afford to lose," Steve Kobashigawa, a marriage and family therapist specializing in addiction, previously told USA TODAY. "Of course, it creates more stress, anxiety, depression and it has a very significant impact on mental health."
If the odds of winning the lottery are so low, why do people bother playing? Dan Field, a therapist specializing in gambling addiction treatment, says the lottery holds such a prominent place in American culture because it gives people the opportunity to indulge in fantasies about how their lives could change if they win.
"There's this desire to be financially unburdened and free − the fantasy that I'm going to always have enough money to do whatever I want, and no one is going tell me what I do," he previously told USA TODAY. "That fantasy can become almost an obsession for some people."
It also becomes a problem, he says, when people of lower socioeconomic status see the lottery as their only chance of joining the ranks of the mega-wealthy.
"With gambling, like with other activities, it can become a single-minded focus, and all other avenues of potential joy fade away," Field said. "They're not as important as the gambling activity."

Most people are able to play lotteries for fun without falling into addictive or destructive patterns. For example, Kobashigawa notes, only about 2% of people in California, the state with the third largest lottery sales in 2022 according to Statista, suffer from a severe gambling disorder or pathological gambling addiction.
Still, when gambling addictions occur, they can wreak disastrous consequences, including job loss, homelessness, family fractures, bankruptcy and criminal activity, like fraud and embezzlement, he says.
"It isn't a very large number, but when it does happen, it's pretty significant," Kobashigawa said, adding he's worked with many clients who became addicted to buying lottery tickets. "There's a very high prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide with people who struggle with gambling disorder. It's very, very serious."

If you do play the lottery, experts say to keep these tips in mind:

Cardi B crying while eating a painfully spicy chicken wing. Jack Harlow dodging a pointed question about his type while sipping a juice box. Mark Cuban attempting a Pittsburgh accent.
If you've kept up with celebrity media tours over the last few years, you've likely come across interview shows like "Hot Ones," hosted by Sean Evans; "The Really Good Podcast" by Bobbi Althoff (next interviewing Scarlett Johansson); or Amelia Dimoldenberg's "Chicken Shop Date." Though these shows' setups vary, their strategy seems the same: Place a celebrity in an extremely awkward situation and capture as many candid moments as possible.
Cringeworthy clips from these shows regularly go viral on TikTok and Instagram, begging the question: What is it about celebrities and excruciating awkwardness that makes us feel like we can't look away?
"There's a reason we are obsessed with this, and much of it has to do with the fact that, whether we mean to or not, we put celebrities on a pedestal," says Henna Pryor, a workplace performance expert and author of "Good Awkward: How to Embrace the Embarrassing and Celebrate the Cringe to Become The Bravest You." "From where we sit, they tend to be extremely good looking, extremely successful. They've got talent that drips from the sky … There's something very relatable and real about seeing them in their element and remembering they're human."
Pryor defines awkwardness as the emotion experienced when the person we believe we are isn't the person who is being perceived.
This gap between the idea of the self versus the true self is especially compelling when observed in celebrities, she says, because we feel we're getting a glimpse into who a star really is behind their carefully crafted persona.
"For a moment in time, that external reality doesn't match the identity we painted for them, and we find that fascinating," she says.
Ty Tashiro, a psychologist and author of "Awkward: The Science of Why We’re Socially Awkward and Why That’s Awesome," says awkwardness can also be instructional and therefore captivating. By watching other people's social blunders, he says, we learn what not to do.
"It's a great opportunity for us to learn about social life and social expectations and social behavior without having to risk any of our social capital," he says. "It's a real advantage to be able to learn vicariously from watching other people's awkward moments."
People love seeing celebrities in uncomfortable situations in particular, he says, because of a phenomenon called downward social comparison. Tashiro describes this as feeling better about oneself from seeing another person feel worse.
"Hot Ones," which shows celebrities struggling to eat chicken wings dipped in extraordinarily spicy hot sauce, capitalizes on this to great effect, he says.
"At that moment, we're actually doing better than the celebrity is," he says. "Something feels a little bit extra sweet about that."

Though intentionally awkward interviews may appear to put celebrities in an unflattering light, they actually do just the opposite, says Ellen Hendriksen, a clinical psychologist and author of "How to Be Yourself: Quiet Your Inner Critic and Rise Above Social Anxiety." By showing their awkward side, celebrities give the impression of vulnerability, which endears them to fans even more.
As a result, a sweaty interview over hot wings may do more to bolster a celebrity's public profile than a traditional news interview.
"When the guests put themselves in these situations and are either sweating profusely or trying to get through this super awkward interview, it's vulnerable," Hendriksen says. "What they're doing is signaling we are the same, the celebrity and the viewers, because who among us hasn't tried to play it cool or act casual when we're suffering a little? Who hasn't been stuck in an awkward conversation that has no graceful way out?"
Awkward interviews are also more prone to go viral, because they fit into the unfiltered aesthetic that's currently popular on social media.
"We went through a very perfectionistic, self-presentational phase," Hendriksen says. "The Gen-Z aesthetic is deliberately weird and ugly and cringe-y as the pendulum just swings the other way. I think we're all sick of perfection and want to see some authenticity."
Whether cringe interviews are a passing fad or here to say remains to be seen; regardless, Tashiro hopes that, in the meantime, they can empower all of us to abandon perfection and embrace our true selves − even if doing so feels a little awkward.
"There's so much pressure in celebrity culture or even influencer culture these days to present this perfect self to the rest of the world. As we know, a lot of people really suffer under that kind of pressure," he says. "I think it's great, whether it's in these shows or podcasts, to create these more genuine and real moments."
LOS ANGELES – Call it a Tay-quake. A seismic ground shift that will overtake movie theaters on Thursday, but first trembled Wednesday night, when Taylor Swift's "The Eras Tour" concert film made its world premiere.
The movie, which the savvy Swift innovated primarily as a way for fans who couldn’t experience her colossal – and equally impressive – Eras Tour, received a debut befitting the comely superstar, whose every footstep seems to require breathless attention.
At the AMC Grove 14 in LA, about 2,200 people – a mix of fans, celebrities including Adam Sandler and Maren Morris, and entertainment industry insiders – filled every theater inside the complex. The surrounding ritzy outdoor shopping mall was closed for the day to allow for the setup and to better patrol ticketless Swifties yearning for a glimpse of their (decidedly not anti) hero.
More:Watching the world premiere of 'Eras Tour' movie with Taylor Swift felt like a dance party
After popping in to visit invited moviegoers in 13 of the theaters, Swift arrived at the one offering Dolby sound – the most effective presentation of this faithful-to-the-live-show movie – with a casual, "Hi, guys."
Swift stood at the front of the theater for a few minutes to express how much fun she's had performing during her Eras Tour and praised her backup singers and dancers, several of whom sat alongside her, pumping fists and singing along as the film unfolded.
"We pranced on that stage grinning because of what met us on the other side," Swift said. "You are main characters in this film. You cared so much about these shows."
Fans enthralled by the Eras concert will undoubtedly thrill at the opportunity to relive the magic and enjoy "The Eras Tour" as a communal concert experience more than a staid movie.

At just under three hours, the celluloid version of Swift's live spectacle is about 30 minutes shorter than her in-person performances throughout her six-month U.S. tour (her overseas dates kick off in November).
Her live shows offered an incredibly fulfilling set list of 45 songs – once she added "Long Live" to the rundown in July – and the film, directed by Sam Wrench, shaves off only a handful of tunes for a more efficient run time.
The songs that didn’t make the cut: "The Archer," "No Body, No Crime," "Long Live," "Illicit Affairs," "Cardigan" and "Wildest Dreams."
The concert footage comes from Swift's final U.S. shows of 2023 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California – she played an astounding six nights at the 70,000-capacity venue – and the film pulls from her Aug. 4 and Aug. 5 dates for her customary "surprise" songs.
Swift opted for "Our Song" to "thank the people who liked me when I was a little teenager writing songs for my ninth-grade talent show," she says on stage in the film.
After leading a crowd singalong of the sweet acoustic strummer, Swift takes her place behind the piano for "You're On Your Own, Kid," from her "Midnights" album.
The entire film offers a front-row seat to the grandeur. The staging is so massive that even the best seats in a stadium – and the King Kong-sized video screens – could provide only so much detail.
But on the big screen, the close-ups are glorious, whether zooming in on Swift's cat-eye makeup outlining her crystal blue eyes, the moss covering her piano and the sweat sticking to her bangs during "Champagne Problems" and her meticulous table setting at the start of "Tolerate It."
Among the performances, "Look What You Made Me Do" sizzles. The detailed shots of the various Swift incarnations in glass cases spotlight the intricacy of the number, while Swift is in her snarling, sexy glory as the camera whirls around her.
"Blank Space" – already one of the meatiest songs in her extensive catalog – also receives a boost from Swift's uncanny ability to find the camera for a coy wink and to unleash her long-legged strut.
Theaters will set their own rules, but the general consensus is that fans are encouraged to have fun, just not at the expense of fellow moviegoers.
At the premiere, it was difficult to tell the screams from the crowd on film from the cheers in the audience, and throughout, several fans stood to sing and dance along. By the time the show-closing "Karma" rolled out, the atmosphere felt like the encore at a concert, a joyful encounter full of love that indicated Swift isn't the only one having a blast at her shows.

Is there anything that Jamie Foxx can't do? Not really, which is why he can play both a street-smart Boston Terrier and soul man Ray Charles.
From his days as a stand-up comedian and starting out on "In Living Color" in the 1990s to snagging a Grammy Award, Foxx's career has been one of joyful versatility – which we've been reminded of in a year full of his movies but also scary health issues. In Foxx's Oscar-winning filmography, he's sung and danced, took snaps as a big-screen quarterback and inhabited a number of real-life roles, including his latest: Foxx, 55, stars as flashy lawyer Willie Gary, who takes the case of a Mississippi funeral home owner (Tommy Lee Jones) in the dramedy "The Burial" (streaming Friday on Amazon Prime Video).
But how does it compare with his outings as a comic-book supervillain and an animated band director? Here are Foxx's 15 essential movies, ranked:
A talking dog comedy just edges out "Miami Vice" on this list, simply because of the vocal energy Foxx brings to the delightfully crass Bugs. He's an independent pooch who humps inanimate objects and trips on magic mushrooms, yet Foxx also adds needed depth to scenes where the canine comes clean about his complicated past.

Who wouldn't vote for Foxx for president? But the actor's POTUS role, James Sawyer, is also an action hero in Roland Emmerich's political thriller. When the White House is under siege and taken over by Secret Service bad guys and mercenaries, Sawyer teams with a Capitol cop (Channing Tatum) to save the day and look cool doing it.

Foxx's supervillain Electro was a blue-skinned travesty we'd all like to forget in "The Amazing Spider-Man 2." However, Foxx nailed a second chance at the character in "No Way Home," giving the dude an electrifying menace and making the most of a rare quiet moment opposite his Spidey (played by Andrew Garfield).
Where to watch: Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon
Sam Mendes' stirring look at life as a Marine during the Gulf War starred Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford, a new recruit following in his dad's military footsteps, and Foxx as Sykes, a staff sergeant who sees his potential and takes him to sniper school. Sykes also really loves his job, revealed via a scary good Foxx in the film's best scene.

'I can see the light':Jamie Foxx took 'an unexpected dark journey' with his health
Playing pimp Slick Charles, Foxx's groovy style fits well in the satirical sci-fi pulp mystery. With his associates, a drug dealer (John Boyega) and a clever prostitute (Teyonah Parris), his character dives deep into a sinister underground conspiracy in the Black community that involves mind control and doppelgangers.

With this revved-up, innovative crime thriller, writer/director Edgar Wright crafts exhilarating car chases and gun fights fueled by catchy songs, and Foxx’s bank-robbing Bats is a bonkers delight that ties into the movie's subtext about the 1% and the downtrodden doing bad things to get what they think they deserve.

Foxx made a little history with this existential animated comedy: He voiced Pixar's first Black lead character, a middle school band teacher named Joe who dreams of being a jazz pianist before falling down a manhole and right into the afterlife. Foxx brings warmth, humor and an occasional touch of exasperation when Joe's dealing with 22, an irascible little soul played by Tina Fey.

The boxing biopic is obviously a Will Smith vehicle – he stars as the iconic Muhammad Ali, after all. Yet Foxx was brilliantly cast in the key role of Drew "Bundini" ("rhymes with Houdini") Brown, the trainer who fought to be in Ali's corner, gave the champ some of his best lines and was with Ali through his most victorious times.
Where to watch:Apple TV, Vudu, Prime Video
In the true-life story, Foxx plays a Black logger wrongfully convicted of strangling and fatally shooting an 18-year-old white woman while Michael B. Jordan is the lawyer out to make sure he gets justice. Both turn in powerful performances as men moving from a place of distrust to making an immeasurable mark on each other.
Where to watch: Apple TV, Vudu, Prime Video
Foxx's first dramatic role came in Oliver Stone's over-the-top football drama. Before the acting and the comedy, Foxx was a high school quarterback in Texas and he lined up under center again on the big screen, as the insanely talented, hard-partying third-string passer who butts heads with teammates (like LL Cool J's star running back).
Where to watch: Apple TV, Vudu, Prime Video
In Quentin Tarantino's brutal take on the spaghetti Western, the title character (Foxx), a former enslaved man, and a dentist bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) take down Southern sibling outlaws and then head off to find Django’s wife in Mississippi. Foxx's watchably righteous fury plays well off Leonardo DiCaprio’s sinister plantation-owning villain.
Where to watch: Apple TV, Vudu
Starring the likes of Beyoncé and Jennifer Hudson, not to mention Eddie Murphy, Bill Condon's Motown-influenced musical is rife with A-listers. Foxx gets a lot to chew on dramatically as Curtis Taylor Jr., an ambitious Detroit car salesman who becomes the manipulative manager of a girl group and gets too close to his singers.
Where to watch: Apple TV, Vudu, Prime Video
Foxx's sheer and sizable charisma is in full force for the real-life legal dramedy as Florida attorney Willie Gary, who helps the cash-strapped owner (Tommy Lee Jones) of a Mississippi funeral home business take on a corporate "deathcare" behemoth. Foxx dazzles as a showboat with heart while holding court in a movie that balances humor with a deeper message.
Where to watch: Prime Video
In Michael Mann's noir action thriller, Foxx is low-key fantastic – and earned a supporting actor Oscar nomination – as LA cab driver Max, who picks up a fare wanting to go a bunch of different places. Worse, the guy (Tom Cruise) turns out to be an assassin on a killing spree, and Foxx is an ace at playing Max's fear and frustration through a harrowing night.
Where to watch: Netflix
Foxx actually scored two Academy Award nominations in the same year but while he didn't win for "Collateral," though no one was going to beat him out for best actor. Bringing all his skills to bear, Foxx's portrayal of Ray Charles – in a movie chronicling his life, loves and songs – is absolutely breathtaking, not just playing the genius musician and businessman but inhabiting the soul of a soul legend.

PHILADELPHIA – Another juggernaut got dismissed here Thursday night, the 104-win Atlanta Braves once again meeting their end at Citizens Bank Park. The 100-win Los Angeles Dodgers are home, the 101-win Baltimore Orioles not yet ready for prime time, and any notion of “top seeds” still alive in this made-for-TV tournament masquerading as the baseball playoffs is pretty much dead.
The Philadelphia Phillies play on, a concept the man who laid out more than $1 billion in salary to produce a club that’s equal parts talented, tough and together tries not to overanalyze.
“I think luck has to be a factor in life,” John Middleton, a man worth an estimated $3.7 billion and assembler of this baseball bacchanalia in South Philly, was saying in the wee hours of Friday morning, streams of champagne and Anheuser-Busch products trickling by him.
“And if anybody who’s successful doesn’t acknowledge that luck has played a part in their success, I think they’re just not paying attention to reality.”
Reality is suddenly this for Middleton and the club he owns: The Phillies are advancing to the National League Championship Series for the second consecutive year, will be heavily favored to defeat the Arizona Diamondbacks and claim back-to-back NL pennants, and somehow have turned a pair of unsettling baseball trends on their ear.
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
And much of it almost certainly wasn’t luck.
Spending big bucks on talent doesn’t work out? (As the Mets, Padres and Yankees discovered that this year).
Since 2019, Middleton has committed $1.04 billion to Bryce Harper, J.T. Realmuto, Zack Wheeler, Kyle Schwarber, Nick Castellanos and Trea Turner. All took their “welcome to Philly” lumps – and have come out the better for it.
Superstars don’t correlate with playoff success?
Well, just ask the Braves how that’s working out in Philly.
Thursday night in NLDS Game 4, the Phillies sent the NL’s likely Cy Young Award winner, Spencer Strider, and MVP, Ronald Acuña Jr., home for the winter behind the brilliance of their own, well-heeled stalwarts.
In their series-ending 3-1 victory, Castellanos, signed to a $100 million deal in March 2022, hit a pair of home runs for the second consecutive night – the first person in playoff history to pull that off – including a game-tying shot that eerily resembled his Game 3 equalizer.
Turner, the final piece of the puzzle, a $300 million shortstop that GM Dave Dombrowski, Middleton and Harper just had to have, had a perfect night: Two singles, a double, a go-ahead home run in the fifth.
As for Harper?
Middleton planted his flag with the then 26-year-old, signing him to a $330 million contract that preceded all the rest. It took four years, but what Harper’s done to Atlanta the past two postseasons almost defies belief:
Fourteen hits in 29 at-bats, five home runs – two in a stunning Game 3 revenge game – and 10 RBI.
Strangely enough, Middleton just kept coming with his checkbook – all the while adding players seemingly as relentless as his spending.
Adding Castellanos to the mix was poignant, in some ways. It reunited the longtime Detroit Tiger with Dombrowski, the GM who drafted him in Detroit, along with former Team USA teammate Harper, roomies in Venezuela as teens, Brave-killers in Philly as adults.
They shared a moment Thursday night, after Castellanos tied the game with a booming shot off Strider and later ended his night with a 112-mph rocket, the hardest-hit ball in his career.
“I said to Casty, that’s why you’re here,” Harper said in the postgame clubhouse. “That’s why I wanted you here. Because of those big moments. That’s what we were doing when we were 16, 17 years old playing in big tournaments.”
Says Castellanos: “I remember him saying like, hey, we are the next A-Rod and Jeter combo. And obviously we're not in their category yet. Derek has five championships, but it's cool.”
They’re working on it.
The Phillies will roll out Wheeler and Aaron Nola in NLCS Games 1 and 2 and will welcome the Diamondbacks to a ballpark where they’re now 26-11 in the postseason – 10-2 in this two-year run.
The Braves, the Padres, the Marlins – they’ve all discovered in the past two years how hard it is when Citizens Bank is in full throat, as it was with 45,831 on hand for Game 4. It makes sense: By the time a club acclimates to this atmosphere, the series is over.
After all, it took all the Philly stars time.
Castellanos acknowledged that year one last year moved too quickly. Harper even had a rough couple months way back in 2019. And Turner famously played so below his standards in this, his first season in Philly, that the notoriously angry masses decided to turn tail and give him a midseason standing ovation.
Just to get his head right.
It worked: Turner finished the year strongly and perhaps reinforced his belief that failure is nothing to fear.
The NLDS was a nice microcosm: Turner made two errors in a crushing Game 2 loss, and Harper finished it with a baserunning misadventure that created plenty of talk the past three days.
Harper and Turner’s response in Games 3 and 4? Nine hits in 15 at-bats, four homers, potential sainthood in Pennsylvania.
“You gotta move on. And I think we've been really good at that,” says Turner. “We have the right clubhouse for that. And you're not going to be perfect throughout the season. You're not going to be perfect in the postseason.
“It's being able to move on and pick each other up. So we got a good group, man. I think that's the only way to put it is someone messes up, so what. We can fix it. We can overcome it. And I think that belief is true. I don't think we're faking it.”
Again, Middleton believes there’s nothing coincidental about that. He believes he and Dombrowski are sterling judges of character, and the recent evidence is hard to dispute.
“Ultimately, when we handed Harper $330 million guaranteed, he was going to respond,” Middleton said of his bell cow. “Bryce looked at that contract and said, I need to live up to this. I need to earn this. As opposed to, I’ve earned it, now I can coast. I’ve got it made.
“And that’s what I think has helped us: Every time we look to sign these guys we ask – what is their character? How are they going to fit in? We make a lot of effort to talk to players, talk to coaches, to make sure they’re going to fit in here.”
As for the early struggles? Middleton is quick to credit the fans for providing both accountability and full-throated support when his stars struggle – along with internal support in the clubhouse.
“Let’s give the fans some credit for that,” Middleton says of Castellanos’ and Turner’s trial periods. “The passion of the Philadelphia fans is unmatched. And when you channel passion positively, it’s an extraordinary motivating force.
“Passion, when directed negatively, is a really corrosive force. These guys stood up and supported Nick, supported Trea, supported Bryce.”
If there’s a unifying theme for both smaller-market teams and analytically inclined big-budget clubs like the Dodgers, it’s that the aim is to provide your team a chance to win in as many years as possible. The Phillies’ approach feels much more scorched earth – see a need, sign a guy, fill the hole.
At some point, the spigot will be turned down, if not totally off. The Phillies are getting close to their ideal, a gritty but wildly talented club that’s both entertaining and successful.
Monday, they’ll take aim at the Diamondbacks, and perhaps will get a revenge date with the Houston Astros in the World Series.
If they fall short, it certainly won’t be for lack of effort – from the owner’s suite to the front office, from the grandstands to the clubhouse, all the factors combining to shoo away the bad playoff mojo that’s befallen so many titans of the game this autumn.
“Winning teams find ways to win,” says Harper, shirtless and clad in socks amid the Phillies’ booming celebratory playlist.
“At all costs.”
SANTA CLARA, Calif. – Holding court in front of his stall in a near-empty San Francisco 49ers locker room, Trent Williams prompted his audience to ponder what Brock Purdy can become in time.
Imagine that. Purdy, 23, has never lost an NFL regular-season game, leads the league in pass efficiency and has a legitimate chance of leading the 49ers to a Super Bowl crown, but the young quarterback is still a baby in NFL terms. Make that an overgrown baby.
“Brock was a rookie last year,” Williams said. “Thrown into the fire. At the end of the year. The player you’re looking at now and the player you saw in early January, late ’22, it’s a different player. The mental bank has so much more in it.
“Obviously, you can’t buy experience. It’s the one thing that can help any player in any system.”
Williams knows. None of this is automatic. Stuff happens. Toiling in his 14th NFL season (Purdy was in elementary school when Williams broke into the league), the burly left tackle has experienced all sorts of drama and flash-in-pan circumstance on his journey. For instance, he was there (with 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan) for the entire rise and fall of the Robert Griffin III phenomenon in Washington.

After Purdy fired four touchdown passes to slay the Dallas Cowboys 42-10 on Sunday night, though, the takeaway from Williams was as good of a warning as any for the NFL universe.
Said Williams: “He’s going to continue to grow. What we’re seeing now is not what he’s going to be.”
If that sounds like something you’ve heard in a horror movie, so be it. Purdy’s rise after being the last player picked in the 2022 NFL draft makes you wonder whether he’s really a monster created by Shanahan and GM John Lynch in some lab hidden below sea level at 4949 Centennial Boulevard.
It’s no wonder George Kittle said after hauling in three TDs from Purdy, “It’s like he’s a robot.”
What a compliment – and subliminal dig at the haters – which speaks to cold efficiency reflected with an NFL-best 123.1 passer rating.
The 49ers (5-0) can set a franchise record at Cleveland on Sunday by winning a 16th consecutive regular-season game, while Purdy can keep piling his cache of superlatives. In winning his first 10 NFL starts since he was thrust into the lineup in December after since-departed Jimmy Garoppolo suffered a foot injury, no player ever posted a higher passer rating than Purdy (121.1).  Only Chad Pennington (70.8%) topped Purdy’s 70.4% completion rate over that 10-game sample size. And just one quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger with 15 in a row, notched more consecutive wins to start a career.
Beneath the numbers are the elements that Kittle raves about.
“He throws some ridiculous passes in practice,” Kittle said.
Purdy is also the same player on Sunday than he is in practice on Wednesday, Kittle insists. That consistency matters when it comes to gaining trust as a quarterback, which goes hand in hand with his preparation and grasp of the details.
“I think really the best thing he does…is his ability to move in the pocket and keep his eyes up and see things develop,” Kittle said. “So, if he doesn’t hit you where he’s supposed to, he sees a second window. He’s very good at that.”
Shanahan said that other than an early incompletion over the middle that was behind Brandon Aiyuk, Purdy was “pretty flawless” against the Cowboys.
If the 49ers keep winning, in time it will be natural to ponder whether Purdy belongs in the conversation about the NFL’s elite quarterbacks. Having 10 regular-season starts and one playoff finish doesn’t provide the track record that declares “elite” but Purdy may be on his way to that level.
Purdy is undoubtedly a beneficiary of great fortune, landing with one of the deepest, most balanced teams in the NFL. If your job is to feed the football to weapons such as Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel, Aiyuk and Kittle, how hard can that be? Add to that the powerful front wall fortified by Williams and a stingy, star-studded defense that won’t leave you having to win shootouts (even though San Francisco is capable, scoring at least 30 points in each game), and a ton of pressure is relieved.
But those factors also overshadow how well Purdy has handled his role. It’s not automatic. Remember, the 49ers traded a bundle to move up and draft Trey Lance in 2021, and he’s gone now. They wanted Lance to become the franchise quarterback and that never materialized. And Garoppolo, who led the 49ers to a Super Bowl berth four years ago, has moved on, too.
Purdy has seized his moment – now and perhaps in the future – because he just doesn’t make the glaring mistakes that can derail young quarterbacks. The reps he had during four years as a starter at Iowa State surely provided a tremendous head start for his NFL career. His big passer rating this season, however, is enabled by the fact that he hasn’t thrown an interception while firing 9 TD passes.
Maybe you were waiting for Purdy to wet his pants in a big moment. Well, it still hasn’t happened. The NFC title game setback at Philadelphia was “incomplete” as he suffered an elbow injury in the first quarter that required surgery.
The latest case, against Dallas, wound up as an example of what Williams talked about regarding Purdy’s learning curve. Purdy had his worst game during the 19-12 NFC divisional playoff victory against the Cowboys in January, when the offense bogged down in the red zone. He learned from it, sensing that he had a better grasp of Dallas’ defensive schemes the second time around.
“Obviously, watching the film from last year, it’s like, ‘Man, I want to be better,’ “ Purdy said.
“Was that my only motivation and goal? No, man, I was just doing what I was asked. Knew the game would come to me over time. You’ve got to get into a rhythm, hit the open guys and do my part as a quarterback. Don’t try to be a superhero and that’s that. So, I learned from the game last year.”
Purdy was in such a rhythm that Shanahan had to remind himself not to call too many passes.
In any event, Purdy sees his flow as part of a bigger picture.
“It feels like everyone’s just on a mission,” he said. “Like the mindset is right where it needs to be. Everyone is so detailed in what they do. The play calls are great. So, it’s like all I have to do is go out there and do my job and that’s it, and just play ball.”
The prized pupil is ready for some more tests.
When NFL teams botches an offseason move, it doesn't always take long for them to own up to the mistake and move on.
Last week alone, two teams orchestrated trades to part with marquee acquisitions from the 2022 offseason: The Chicago Bears, who cast off Chase Claypool after getting just 10 games from a wide receiver for whom they traded the No. 32 overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft, and the Denver Broncos, who sent pass rusher Randy Gregory packing in a trade to the San Francisco 49ers just 19 months after inking him to a five-year, $70 million contract.
That got us thinking about what recent moves are already showing troublesome signs.
With that in mind, we asked USA TODAY Sports' NFL writers and columnists: What has proven to be the most regrettable move or decision from this past offseason?
Their answers:
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
Ezekiel Elliott pretty much sums it up … times two. Seven of his 12 touchdowns for the Dallas Cowboys in 2022 came from 1 yard out and all of them occurred in the red zone. But he was not re-signed in the offseason for a team allegedly committed to running the ball – and one now succeeding on 37% of its red-zone opportunities. Zeke did take a very team-friendly, one-year, $3 million deal to go to the New England Patriots, a club that really needed to add juice to its offense – and we’d argue a heavily used 28-year-old running back doesn’t really qualify. Foresight was 20/20 on this one – Dallas should’ve kept Elliott, and the Pats should have found a dynamic weapon for their dead-in-the-water offense. – Nate Davis
Not trying to lure Tom Brady back to the New England Patriots. I'm kidding about another TB12 unretirement. I think. Not kidding, though, when considering how Bill Belichick didn't do more to improve New England's quarterback position. If not TB12, B.B. could have made a run at Baker Mayfield, who is faring rather well (3-1) so far as Brady's replacement with the Bucs. Then there were two others -- Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett -- who might have been enticed back to Foxborough. Instead, Belichick rolled with Mac Jones as QB1, to disastrous, last-place results (1-4) and the league's 26th-ranked offense. Jones' 74.2 passer rating is third-worst in the NFL. And it looks even worse when Zach Wilson and Daniel Jones are the only QBs ranked lower for efficiency. Belichick's decision to bring back Bill O'Brien to run the offense seemed like a shrewd move, especially when compared to the offensive Matt Patricia-Joe Judge experiment. Yet O'Brien really needs to prove that he's a miracle worker. When the young quarterback regresses with no viable alternatives in sight, you get what the Patriots are living with: a hot mess. – Jarrett Bell
The Denver Broncos trading for Sean Payton and not allowing him to start from scratch immediately. Instead, the organization stays mired in one of the most brutal stretches in franchise history. From the get-go, it was clear Russell Wilson and Payton were not going to be simpatico off the field. Perhaps they could work it out on the field? Thus far, that has not been the case, either. And Payton made it much worse by criticizing former coach Nathaniel Hackett, who lasted less than one season. Denver gave its first-round pick in the 2023 draft (and a 2024 second-rounder) to the New Orleans Saints for Payton’s services. Hiring Payton, and making him one of the highest-paid coaches in the NFL, is a long-term play. But the Wilson-Payton pairing was ill-conceived and set the franchise back another year. – Chris Bumbaca
The Giants pledged their allegiance to Daniel Jones when they signed him to a four-year extension worth $160 million ($82 million guaranteed) in March. Jones has responded with just two touchdowns and six interceptions to begin the season. Jones’ 176 passing yards per game average is the worst mark among NFC East starting quarterbacks. While Jones’ 71.7 passer rating ranks dead last among NFL starting quarterbacks. Jones is hardly the sole problem in New York. The Giants have a patchwork offensive line and a below average receiving corps. But the Giants gave Jones franchise quarterback-type money. Franchise quarterbacks are supposed to elevate their team. Jones hasn’t been able to do so. 
Maybe the Giants are beginning to figure out what many of us already believed; Jones isn’t a franchise quarterback. The Giants should have prioritized running back Saquon Barkley, who re-signed on one-year in July, over Jones. Barkley might be oft injured, but New York’s offense runs through him when he’s on the field. – Tyler Dragon
In a relatively restrained offseason, Jawaan Taylor landing a four-year, $80 million contract with the Kansas City Chiefs stood out as one of the few truly controversial moves. Sure, that's essentially the going rate for top offensive tackles these days. But Taylor, 25, hasn't established himself in that class yet, meaning this was a substantial bet on his growth potential. In the early going, that wager has gone bust. Through five weeks, Taylor had a solid lead as the NFL's most penalized player with nine accepted flags. Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid have come to the right tackle's defense, saying he was being unfairly targeted by officials. But beyond the penalties, Taylor hasn't been nearly good enough as a protector for Mahomes. In the cutthroat AFC, the margin for error is slim, especially with the young receiving corps yet to find its way. Things are still salvageable, but a significant leap will be required for Taylor's deal not to go down as one of the franchise's bigger missteps in recent history. – Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz
It’s true: we’re one step closer to flag football being an Olympic sport. Yes, that’s totally absurd. Yes, adding flag football would be one of the dumbest things the International Olympic Committee has ever done (and that’s saying something).
The IOC will soon decide on which of the five proposed new sports will be allowed into the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. One of those proposals is to add flag football. When news of that possibility became public this week, it was met with a positive response from at least one NFL star: Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill.
"Calling all NFL guys let's bring one home," Hill posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, speaking about a gold medal.
If Hill gets his wish, he'd be part of the flag football version of the Avengers. While the idea of flag football as an Olympic sport is goofy, if it’s going to happen, let’s dominate this sucker, the way Americans dominated the Russians at Lake Placid. Do you believe in flag miracles? Yes!
Our flags? They will be made in America. In Texas. At the Alamo. We’ll have the best flags. The greatest flags. Flags so pristine and beautiful we’ll be able to eat our hot dogs and apple pie off of them. There will also be no soft flag pulling. We’re not France. Plus, when we pull a flag, every American will stop and stand for the anthem.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
In all seriousness, the NFL says that flag football is one of the world’s fastest-growing sports. That it’s played by over 20 million people in more than 100 countries and women and girls are driving the fastest growth.
This may all be true but all of this still smacks of a rich American corporation, acting in its own self-interest, using flag football, and the Olympics, as a way of spreading the NFL gospel around the world. Can’t blame the NFL for trying this. Many sports have done the same thing. Hell, the NBA had the Dream Team, and it was a marketing bonanza. But the primary reason for its existence was the 1988 Olympic team failing to win gold. The NFL's attempt at this feels far more artificial.
Yet, I have to admit, if this does happen, people will watch. Lots of people. Because the NFL as an organization will push for some of its top stars to compete. Individual teams will be horrified at such an idea fearing a catastrophic injury. Can you imagine Hill blowing out his knee?
But if the flag football Olympics do happen, maybe the team will look like mine below. Some caveats. This is assuming the teams are standard five-on-five. This also assumes the NFL and union would even allow its biggest stars to participate. Also, remember, not every player in the NFL can be on the team. Don't send me 500 emails saying Stefon Diggs needs to be on the squad.
And yes, this team can't account for future star players who might emerge between now and the time of the Games. I'm not a time traveler, buddy.
Let's all say it together: U...S...A.
COACH, TOM BRADY. Age in 2028: Immortal being. Normally, you'd have Bill Belichick lead this team, but have you seen the Patriots lately? Plus, there'd be a built-in backup quarterback.
QUARTERBACK, LAMAR JACKSON, Ravens. Age in 2028: 31. Even in his 30s, Jackson would still be one of the fastest humans on the planet.
CENTER, TRAVIS KELCE, Kansas City. Age in 2028: 39. Once the center snaps the football, he can go out for a pass. At 6 feet 5 inches, Kelce could just post up defenders. Also, Kelce would bring the Taylor Swift fanbase with him. Assuming they're still together. If they're not, it would be a sad day for the planet.
WIDE RECEIVER, TYREEK HILL, Dolphins. Age in 2028: 34. A very public flag football backer. Also, runs in attoseconds.
WIDE RECEIVER, JUSTIN JEFFERSON, Vikings. Age in 2028: 29. His abilities would rupture the flag space-time continuum.
WIDE RECEIVER, MARVIN HARRISON JR. Age in 2028: 26. He'll be a top five pick in this upcoming draft, a Super Bowl winner with the Chicago Bears, and then a gold medalist.
RUSHER, DE'VON ACHANE, DOLPHINS. Age in 2028: 26. Any player who rushes the passer must be a minimum of seven yards past the line of scrimmage at the snap. Achane can cover that distance before you learn how to properly pronounce his name ("duh-VON AY-chan").
DEFENSIVE BACK, TARIQ WOOLEN, SEAHAWKS. Age in 2028: 29. Ran a 4.26 40-yard dash at the scouting combine in 2022.
DEFENSIVE BACK, KALON BARNES, JETS. Age in 2028: 29. Ran a 4.23 40-yard dash at the combine. Somehow, he ran faster than Woolen.
SAFETY, JA'MARR CHASE, BENGALS. Age in 2028: 28. My team will feature receivers as safeties. Because why not.
SAFETY, AMON-RA ST. BROWN, LIONS. Age in 2028: 28. If his stint at safety works out in the Olympics, he should play the position in the NFL.
So this is the team. The Flag Dream Team.
But we have to come up with a better name than that.
Tourists were officially welcomed back to West Maui on Sunday, exactly two months after devastating wildfires displaced thousands of residents, killed 98 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings.
Historic Lahaina Town – once the capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom – was, and is still, unrecognizable. Cleanup of debris has barely begun. 
Hawaii Gov. Josh Green announced on Sept. 8 that the unaffected areas just north from where the fire took place would reopen to travelers so “people from Hawaii and around the world can resume travel to this special place and help it begin to recover economically,” he said in a news conference. 
To kick off the reopening, five hotels and eight timeshare condos in West Maui started accepting guests and owners, starting with 3 miles of the northwestern coast.
Tourists and residents alike have been grappling with the island’s reopening plans, with some wondering if it’s insensitive to bring back visitors months after the deadliest wildfire in recent U.S. history. Besides palpable grief, residents fear the government will prioritize visitor dollars over their urgent needs, like education and housing, but what hangs in the balance is the livelihoods of many of them.

“Maui on its own is clearly the biggest tourism hub of the neighbors, even in comparison to Honolulu,” said Peter Fuleky, professor of economics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. While the island only accounts for 12% of the state’s jobs, it makes up one-third of the visitor spending statewide, according to a recent report by the Economic Research Organization at the University of Hawaii. In 2021 and 2022, Maui was the most visited island over Oahu. 
Visitor arrivals on Maui in August dipped more than 60% compared to the month prior, according to data from the Hawaii Tourism Authority.
The reopening of West Maui – home to over half of all the accommodations on the island – has been controversial as recovery from the fires has been slow and emotional for residents. Some West Maui residents accept respectful visitors looking to support local businesses and volunteer while others want to delay the reopening for more time to heal. 
Prior to the reopening, the state and county released sensitivity messaging, asking tourists to be respectful and not take inappropriate photos.
“I know we are still grieving, and it feels too soon, but the reality is there are those in our community who are ready to get back to work. Bills need to be paid, keiki (children) have needs and our kupuna (elders) face continued medical care,” Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen said in a video statement. 
The reopening of West Maui has been billed as a “phased setting” by Bissen. During the first phase, all travel restrictions to Kaanapali, Napili, Honokowai and Kapalua have been lifted. Hotels will open in groups. 
“No one should be discouraged or reluctant to go and support the businesses and workers that rely on tourism in West Maui for their families’ livelihood,” according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority website. 
Meanwhile, Lahaina remains closed to the public “until further notice out of respect to the town’s residents.” About two weeks ago, the first group of Lahaina residents were allowed to visit their properties and survey the damage in protective gear due to highly toxic ash.  
Even though state officials dated the reopening on Sunday, tourism recovery is expected to be “very slow,” according to Carl Bonham, professor of Economics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and founding member of the Economic Research Organization. 
An 80% recovery of pre-fire visitor levels isn’t expected in Maui until the end of 2024, according to the Economic Research Organization. 
“Even if they didn’t do a phase reopening, there’s no reason to believe there would suddenly be tens of thousands of visitors rushing into West Maui,” he said. 
The date is to help travelers plan future trips to the island. “It’s about learning some of the lessons from the pandemic where we didn’t make the announcement that we were reopening on a date in the future until well behind the point when we were ready, then it takes time for people to plan,” Bonham said. 
'We need responsible tourism':Maui businesses plead tourists to help economy after fires
Merriman’s Kapalua, an oceanfront restaurant in West Maui since 2009, is one of those businesses ready to reopen its doors. Since the fires, the restaurant has been delivering hundreds of free meals and operating as a place with free Wi-Fi for West Maui residents. When in operation, about 90% of the produce used is sourced from local farmers. 
“It’s absolutely not too soon (to reopen West Maui),” the restaurant’s owner, Peter Merriman, told USA TODAY. He said many of his employees want to go back to work. “If people feel like it’s too soon, that’s fine, they don’t have to go back to work.” 
Merriman said that without the official reopening, the restaurant would have stayed closed for a little longer, but he feels like it’s his “civic duty” for travelers to West Maui to have somewhere to go eat. “We’re probably going to lose money for the first several months we’re open, but it’s our responsibility,” he said. 
Even though his doors will be open, Merriman’s “really worried” how many patrons will even walk through his doors. “I think it’s going to take close to a year where people will feel comfortable to go to West Maui,” Merriman said. 
Jesse Imbach, a 46-year-old Maui resident, lost his restaurants in Lahaina to the fire and is looking for a new location to relaunch the business. Imbach said he’s OK with a phased reopening but worries that it will take away resources from locals or bring over “macabre-type tourists” who are interested in seeing the aftermath of the tragedy.
The day before the reopening, Bissen shared in a statement how he wants “visitors to understand that our island is making its way through a devastating tragedy.” Officials have launched several online resources for visitors to find more information about how to donate, volunteer and plan their trips to Maui, such as the Maui Strong website and the Hawaii Tourism Authority website. A list of local businesses to support can be found at Maui Nui First. 
“We should be really thoughtful about impacting the folks who are still emotionally reeling from the loss of their heritage and their livelihood, and their history and their family home,” Imbach said. “The key thing is encouraging tourists to behave well is really important, because the community is definitely still hurting.”
To access the parts of West Maui that are reopening means people will have to drive through burn zones, which have mostly been covered by fencing. Many residents aren’t ready to enter the tragedy-stricken area yet. 
Earlier this month, people gathered at the state Capitol in Honolulu to speak out against the Oct. 8 reopening and drop off a petition with 14,000 signatures to the Governor’s office. 
One of those in support of the petition is Blake Ramelb, who was born and raised in Lahaina but lives in Napili. He told USA TODAY that the "timeline of this just felt so rushed in so many ways, two months is definitely not enough time."
"People didn’t get a chance to grieve, not only because it’s just been two months but they don't know where they’re going to live tomorrow," he said. He added that the quick reopening has also taken a toll on the mental health of many residents, who are already struggling from the tragedy itself.
The Maui City Council voted unanimously for a resolution on Friday that echoed pleas to delay the reopening, saying the two-month anniversary was not “trauma-informed.” 
“It's really hard to know what is the right decision, honestly, because you're balancing between protecting your community and people who are completely devastated, and economic, financial implications of not opening,” said Jan Jones, a lecturer and coordinator for hospitality and tourism management at the University of New Haven.
But some argue that small businesses need tourists, especially after taking a hit from the pandemic. One recent study found the island lost more than $13 million of visitor spending per day in the weeks after the fire, according to the Economic Research Organization.   
“The small businesses can’t weather another storm. They just can't,” said Jerry Agrusa, a hospitality and tourism management professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa’s Shidler College of Business. 
Agrusa said tourists can help the island’s recovery by being mindful of where they spend their money.
“Eat lunch in a family-owned restaurant. Look for the smallest person that does tours. Look for the local guy who gives surf lessons. Look for the ones that are greatly affected, where they don't have these great companies behind them,” he said. “That would be so helpful right now.”

UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay.
Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports.
Their partnership should have been a force for good. Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.
The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.
Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.
But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.
According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.
“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”
In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”
“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”
Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.
The stakes are high for everyone.
Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.
Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.
Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.
Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.
“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”
USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.
Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.
For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.
Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.
For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.
“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”
Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.
Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.
At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.
By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.
Tucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.
Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline
Tucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.
Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.
Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.
Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.
During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.
They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.
In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”
It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.
Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.
Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.
They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.
Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.
By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.
Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.
Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”
Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.
Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.
Twelve days later came the call.
Tracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.
According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.
“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”
Tracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”
She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.
“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”
Tracy said she thought to herself, "Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it." In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”
When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.
Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.
Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.
At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.
Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.
When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.
Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.
Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”
Tucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.
The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.
Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.
She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.
Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.
“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”
The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.
A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.
Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.
Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.
Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.
Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.
Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.
“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.
Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.
Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.
Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.
Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.
They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.
“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”
Michigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.
The case would go forward.
Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22.
He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.
For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.
Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.
An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.
Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.
During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”
Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.
“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”
Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.
Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.
Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.
Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.
At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.
Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.
Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”
Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.
One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.
A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”
“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”

On a sunny Thursday morning, Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker strolled through tomato fields at a farm in Immokalee, Florida, toured its processing plants and loaded baskets of bright green fruit into a truck. 
It was a private event thrown by the school to promote its migrant student services program, which provides financial aid and support to farmworkers seeking college degrees. After the April 28, 2022, tour, disclosed in records obtained by USA TODAY this week, Tucker met with community leaders and alumni.
That night, Tucker would make the now-infamous phone call from his hotel room in nearby Naples, during which he is accused of masturbating and making unwanted sexual comments to Brenda Tracy, a prominent rape survivor and activist he had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence.
Yet, when Tucker met with the university’s outside investigator in March for his interview in the sexual harassment case against him, he insisted the trip was not work-related – a claim the investigator would disprove in her report.
It’s just one example of Tucker failing to keep his story straight at the most consequential moment of his career. 
With his job, reputation and the roughly $80 million left on his contract at stake, Tucker repeatedly made false statements to the investigator and misled her about basic facts, such as his location during the phone call and the date it occurred, a USA TODAY review of more than 1,200 pages of case documents found. 
The investigator, Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, and the news organization both obtained documents and witness statements that discredit key aspects of Tucker’s version of events. 
Michigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sept. 10, hours after Tracy went public for the first time with her story in USA TODAY. On Monday, the school informed Tucker it plans to fire him for cause based on the conduct he had admitted to and the embarrassment he had caused the school. 
Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivor
Although Tucker denied sexually harassing Tracy, he acknowledged masturbating on the call, saying he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex.” Tracy said Tucker’s romantic interest in her was completely one-sided and that she had tried to set boundaries multiple times during their yearlong business partnership.
Per his contract, Tucker has until Tuesday to make a case for keeping his job. Regardless, a formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated school policies against sexual harassment and exploitation is expected to proceed on Oct. 5 and 6. 
Since his suspension, Tucker has issued multiple public statements defending himself, attacking Tracy and accusing Veidlinger of bias. He accused the school of conducting a “sham” hearing and having “ulterior motives.” Yet even in these written statements, the central details of his story changed entirely.
Tucker, who previously hung up on a reporter who called him on his cellphone asking about the case, did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. His attorney, Jennifer Belveal, has not responded to phone calls and emails. Tracy declined to comment for this story.
In the absence of eyewitnesses or recordings, sexual harassment cases usually boil down to whose account is more credible, said Elizabeth Abdnour, a Lansing-based attorney and former Michigan State Title IX investigator who has taken part in dozens of campus cases.
“It’s very, very unusual that you would have some outside piece of evidence that would give you a clear decision,” Abdnour said. “Very often you’re weighing credibility based on little bits and pieces of information.” 
In multiple cases she has worked, Abdnour said the respondents lost because they were found to have a greater propensity for lying than the complainants. The hearing officer must determine how much weight to give Tucker’s false and conflicting statements, Abdnour said, and they could sway the case in Tracy’s favor.
“I believe a fact finder could assess these pieces of evidence about credibility and make a determination that Brenda is more credible than Mel,” she said. “In my experience, a clear sign of a lack of credibility is generally taken very seriously.”
By the time Tucker met with Veidlinger for his interview, he had had months to prepare.
The school had informed him of Tracy’s complaint on Dec. 22, the day after she filed it. Veidlinger had interviewed Tracy and all six of her witnesses by the end of January. Tucker was the only holdout.
Rather than tell his side of the story right away, Tucker and his attorney spent three months trying to stop the investigation, case documents show. They wrote legal arguments urging Michigan State to drop the case and twice approached Tracy’s attorney proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no, and the school pressed forward.
On March 22, the day of his interview, Tucker sent Veidlinger a seven-page written account of his interactions with Tracy and lists of their “currently existing” text message and call history, which he said his legal team had compiled. Only a handful of text messages remained; he and Tracy both told the investigator they had deleted their texts with each other in the months after the April 2022 phone call.
In his interview, which lasted 3 ½ hours, Tucker questioned whether Tracy had mixed up the date of the call. He said he recalled being at his home in East Lansing when it occurred, but his own records showed that he had been in Florida on April 28, attending a charity function that was “absolutely not a University-sponsored event.”
His seven-page account told a different story – that he had called her while he was “alone in a hotel room.”
Veidlinger does not appear to have asked Tucker about the discrepancy, based on case documents. But by then she knew what he told her in the interview was untrue: she had already obtained records proving he had not been home in East Lansing.
An expense report he had submitted to the university for reimbursement of his hotel and meals shows Tucker flew to Naples, Florida, to attend a golf fundraiser hosted by The Greg H. Montgomery Jr. Foundation for Ultimate Growth, which raises awareness for suicide prevention. It showed he stayed at the Hilton from April 27 to 29, that the trip’s purpose was “administrative” and that it did not involve personal travel. He had flown there on a donor’s private plane.
The trip is when Tucker toured the farm in Immokalee to help promote Michigan State’s College Assistance Migrant Program. The event was titled “Working to make dreams a reality,” according to an agenda obtained from the university by USA TODAY through a public records request. The agenda features Tucker’s name prominently. Tucker posted photos from the tour on his Twitter account.
That Tucker was on a university-sponsored work trip during the incident was a contributing factor in the university’s determination that it had jurisdiction to investigate, the investigation report shows. 
Tucker’s lists of calls and text messages also were missing an important detail: They did not show any communication with Tracy on April 28. He acknowledged in the interview, however, that he had not reviewed the lists before submitting them and that they may have been incomplete.
Tracy, meanwhile, had already provided Veidlinger with her official cellphone records from Sprint that confirmed the date of their call: April 28.
Tucker and Tracy did not speak in the three months after the April 28 call.
Meanwhile, their assistants were planning Tracy’s third visit to campus – an in-person training with coaches and players scheduled for July 25.
Tucker canceled that training three days before, the investigation report shows. When Tracy spoke to him by phone on Aug. 2 seeking to find out why, she would tell the investigator in her interview that Tucker insinuated he would harm her career if she spoke about his conduct. He never rescheduled her visit, and they never spoke again.
The cancellation became a key focus of the investigator – one of a series of alleged incidents that taken together would meet the definition of sexual harassment, which can include pressuring someone into engaging in sexual behavior for an employment benefit and threatening that rejecting such behavior will carry a negative consequence.
“Reported allegations that a University employee is engaging in misconduct within the vendor-vendee relationship for which they are the decision-maker, and/or impeding in such a services relationship based on a quid-pro-quo sexual harassment allegation, is within a University sponsored program or activity,” Veidlinger wrote in the report, so school policy covered it.
Tucker tried to distance himself from the cancellation in a public statement on Sept. 11, the day after Michigan State suspended him without pay.
“I never cancelled any presentation,” he wrote. “Given a personnel change and scheduling challenges as football season approached, we merely postponed it until January 2023. She chose to file her complaint instead of proceeding with the training.”
But that statement contradicts what he told the investigator. When Veidlinger asked in his March interview if he had a role in canceling Tracy’s visit, Tucker said, “Yes, absolutely I did,” the report shows, and that he did not recall any discussions about rescheduling Tracy for January. Such timing would not make sense, he added, because most of his new players would not yet be on campus. 
Tucker also told the investigator why he canceled the visit, blaming it on a scheduling conflict. He said he had recently hired a mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, who needed to implement his new program on short notice. There was limited time in fall camp, Tucker said, and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” the players. He said he decided to yield the time to Newman.
Veidlinger, however, would later obtain records showing Newman did not meet with the team on July 25, the day of Tracy’s planned visit. He had been meeting with them weekly since June 6, the records showed but held no meetings between July 15 and July 28.
One of Tucker’s assistants, who is a witness in the case, also told the investigator that Tucker asked him via text message to cancel it. He said he was never instructed to reschedule. 
In his interview, Tucker told Veidlinger that his relationship with Tracy frayed after the April 2022 phone call – not because of the incident, but because of information he learned after that caused him not to trust her.
According to Tucker, an associate of his had told him over the summer that Tracy’s assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, had been gossiping about Tucker’s marriage, telling others it was “on the rocks.” Tucker said he was “devastated” because he had confided in Tracy about his marital problems, and he believed she had discussed them with Alvarado.
Tucker confronted Tracy about the alleged gossiping during the Aug. 2 phone call, they both told the investigator. Tracy said he berated and bullied her, repeatedly saying he could not trust her. She said she told him she did not know what he was talking about.
Alvarado – who was killed in a car crash in June – would deny discussing Tucker’s marriage with anyone in her January interview with Veidlinger. 
During the Aug. 2 call, Tracy said she pressed Tucker to identify his source – the associate. She told Veidlinger she believed Tucker had made it up as a pretext for canceling her visit and ending her relationship with the school.
Veidlinger also asked Tucker to reveal the source of his claim, but he refused to say. In her report, she wrote that he said he had “given (his) word that (he) wouldn’t divulge their name.” 
Tucker never revealed the associate’s name to the investigator, nor did he identify anyone who could support his version of events. In his Sept. 11 public statement, however, he lamented that the hearing would not afford him the opportunity to “offer any substantive evidence of innocence.”
It was not the only claim he attributed to his anonymous associate. In his interview, he said that same person told him that ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating how Tracy “goes about her business” by claiming to be a rape survivor.  
Tucker said this further caused him to believe Tracy was untrustworthy because she believed Lavigne was her friend but didn’t know she was investigating the rape story at the center of her public persona. 
It turned out to be yet another falsehood.
Reached by USA TODAY, Lavigne said in an emailed statement that she was “perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.” She said Tracy has been a source of information for her for several years, and that she has featured Tracy’s comments and advocacy work in multiple news stories.
“That has been the extent of my reporting on Tracy and her organization,” Lavigne wrote. “Neither the organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting.”
Asked who might have told Tucker this misinformation, Lavigne responded, “I have absolutely no idea who would have alleged this to anyone.”

The bullets came in plywood crates. 
Any given box was about the size of a small microwave oven. The printed label stuck to each one demonstrated a militaristic brevity. “CARTRIDGES FOR WEAPONS, INERT PROJECTILE,” next to a bright yellow hazmat sticker, “EXPLOSIVES.” 
Inside the boxes: drab green steel cans of .50-caliber ammunition. Each round was giant, more than 5 inches long, built to be fired from a gun so big it is typically bolted to a truck. The bullets were clipped together in long strands for rapid, machine-gun fire. 
By the time Bill Brown got to the boxes, they sat double-stacked eight high atop wooden pallets inside a Missouri warehouse. The pallets went on, row after row. Three million bullets in all. 
It was enough ammunition to feed a single machine gun – if fired nonstop at its rated speed eight hours a day, seven days a week – for almost six months. 
Brown’s job was to get it out of there and toward the Ukrainian front lines. The faster, the better. 
“War is bad,” Brown said. “Loss of life is bad. But at the end of the day, it’s very profitable and injects revenue into this military industrial base.”
There would be virtually no public record of this Ukrainian arms shipment. As a weapons dealer, Brown’s company would deliver the bullets under a system known as a direct commercial sale. The ammunition required a State Department signoff – but the secret deal would never appear in a White House announcement or the Congressional Record. 
Instead, it was part of a shadowy system of brokers, exporters, arms dealers and country-to-country transfers that has become one part of the race to meet demand on distant battlefields. 
Western weaponry fueled Ukraine’s summertime counteroffensive along a 600-mile front. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the effort was delayed in part by the wait for more arms. Amid concerns about that slowly progessing counteroffensive, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday with a promise of up to $175 million more in military equipment. 
Most of America’s $44 billion in documented support to Ukraine came in the form of old U.S. military stock, donated directly by the federal government. In general, commercial sales over $14 million, and sales of military-grade weaponry like mortars or missiles, require State Department approval and congressional notification.
But other aid comes via private sales. 
More than 14,000 U.S. entities are registered to conduct defense trade activities. Their deals are monitored by an alphabet soup of agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Trade secrecy clauses in federal law mean this flow of gear, weapons and ammunition is almost never revealed to the public.
Brown, who works for a small Nevada-based logistics company called Battle Born Munitions, provided USA TODAY with a rare look behind the curtain of these private sales. Details about the shipment were verified by his employer and the European government that made the purchase. State Department officials declined to answer questions about the specific shipment Brown described.
This March sale and the secret number of other shipments like it fuel Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion. Those sales also release an unknown amount of weaponry into the world. What becomes of that weaponry after it’s sold – and especially after it’s delivered – is difficult to track. 
As Brown surveyed the warehouse in Missouri, a crew steered forklifts and skid lifts among the stacks of plain wooden boxes. From high in the trusses, suspended lamp fixtures bathed the boxes in artificial daylight. Brown lifted his camera and started snapping photos. 
In just a few hours, he and his cargo would be boarding a jumbo jet. Three million bullets would climb to the stratosphere and hurtle across the north Atlantic toward a European dawn.
From Ukraine:War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented. So is the country's push for swift justice.
The bullets had once been bound for Saudi Arabia. 
Lot number SMQ19K401L026 had rolled off the assembly line in 2019 at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Kansas City. Lake City, owned by the government and run by a contractor, sprawls across nearly 4,000 acres of green Missouri farmland. Roads curve past World War II-era bunkers known as igloos, spaced out amid the countryside – far enough apart that an explosion in one won’t trigger a chain reaction in the others.
Lake City has been pumping out ammunition almost without pause since 1941. It is the largest small-arms manufacturing plant in the world.
Today the plant is run by Olin-Winchester, but in 2019, the bullets were made by some of the 1,700 workers employed by Northrop Grumman. And in 2019, Saudi Arabia was stocking up on weapons during the Trump administration, fueling the war in Yemen and other conflicts that drew criticism from congressional Democrats.
The plant manufactures .50-caliber ammunition on a rolling basis, for both military and commercial buyers. That’s a testament to just what a legend the bullet – and the gun that shoots it – has become.
In 2019, the technology was already a century old. The .50 caliber was the brainchild of American gunsmith John Browning during World War I. Built to respond to German anti-tank rifles, the M2 was first tested in 1918, and it entered widespread service in 1923. It earned the nickname “Ma Deuce” and has served in combat ever since, bolted to trucks, ships, planes and handheld stands on the battlefield.
The .50-caliber rounds – named for their diameter, about half an inch – can easily hit targets more than a mile away. At closer ranges, they will blast through solid concrete or armored vehicles. The gun can fire at a sustained rate of about 40 shots per minute.
Military setups use strings of “linked” ammunition to feed into machine guns. Spaced out after every fourth bullet, so-called tracer rounds have small pyrotechnic charges that illuminate the line of fire, aiding in targeting.
The gun’s longevity and versatility made it popular for militaries the world over. But this particular batch of bullets wouldn’t end up being sold to Saudi Arabia. 
The Biden administration put a temporary freeze on sales to the Saudi government in 2021 as it reviewed weapons deals approved under Donald Trump. Instead, Brown said, the bullets were sold to a U.S. ammunition provider, only to be held up again. Ultimately, they were mothballed. 
Then, in spring 2023, the bullets found a buyer, or actually two: first Battle Born; ultimately, the Netherlands. 
The European country, a NATO ally, needed a big supply of ammunition. It wouldn’t be keeping the bullets but giving them to Ukraine. Its purchase, essentially a donation, would count toward the country’s required NATO contribution. 
Brown had a line on exactly what they needed. It was sitting in the warehouse in Missouri. 
He arrived in March to personally oversee the shipment. As he prepped for delivery, Brown dropped tiny black tracking devices onto several of the pallets. Just $55 apiece, the units use GPS and cell signals to keep tabs on the load. The idea was to ensure it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands. 
But packing up the bullets was just the beginning. As with anything that’s deadly and made of metal, the shipping costs can be extreme. 
Brown said the question for the buyer was simple: “How fast do you want it? Forty-five to 60 days on a ship? Or in five days if I fly it?”
Brown – or Chief Bill, as he prefers – is a no-nonsense 35-year veteran of the U.S. Army and former helicopter pilot. He retired as a chief warrant officer and lives in Orlando. 
Now 59, he still spends a lot of time on the road – 10 international trips this year. He says his arms logistics work takes him to places most Americans would rather avoid – near the Syrian border or to unstable regions of Iraq.
He’ll travel halfway around the world, he quips, “have some soup, and go back to Warsaw to head home.” The trips aren’t really about the destinations. They’re about the cargo. 
On that spring day in Missouri, forklifts carefully loaded 107 pallets of the ammo onto 18 flatbed semitrailers. They’d all make the eight-hour drive to O’Hare International Airport. 
In Chicago, two Boeing 747-400s operated by National Airlines would be ready for the freight. 
Four pallets each were stacked and shrink-wrapped to create “air pallets” or “cookie sheets” weighing 12,800 pounds. Each plane could carry up to 17 of the pallets that ran the length of each plane secured by white cargo netting.
Flight records Brown provided show the two planes departed about seven hours apart, one in early afternoon, one after dark. 
The flight would take nine hours. Brown wasn’t going to the Netherlands, even though it was the buyer. The planes were bound for Rzeszów, Poland. 
The ancient city sits at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland. It has a gleaming modern airport next to a major east-west freeway. From there, it’s barely 60 miles to the border with Ukraine. 
It was an expensive journey. The trucking company’s bill for those 18 semis? $85,000. Chartering the two 747s? $625,000. Each.
But this shipment of .50-cal rounds was profitable for Battle Born Munitions, according to Brown.
The company purchased the 3 million rounds from Northrop Grumman at a bargain and resold them for more than double the price. (In subsequent interviews, representatives at BBM disputed the specific totals Brown mentioned, saying the accurate figures were protected by “various commercial and government non-disclosure agreements.” They did not dispute the other specifics of the deal he provided.) 
Retail prices for .50-caliber ammunition run roughly $5 per bullet. At that rate, the whole shipment would have been worth $15 million.
The pricing might also be elastic. The Dutch mark up the price of the bullets and count it toward their NATO contribution, pegged to a percentage of gross domestic product, Brown said. The Netherlands has contributed about $15 billion to NATO this year, or about 1.7% of its GDP and just under the NATO mandate of 2%.
Representatives of the Dutch military confirmed the shipment to USA TODAY but declined to comment further about the pricing or details.
The war in Ukraine has only increased the demand for private deals. The State Department signed off on more than $154 billion in commercial arms deals directly to foreign countries in 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year. 
Direct commercial sales represent a modest portion of the contribution to Ukraine compared with the $44 billion donated by the U.S., but they still amounted to more than $600 million in sales from U.S. companies to the Ukrainian government last year alone. That doesn’t include sales to other countries that also support Ukraine – sales like the one Brown described.
Jim Bartlett, an attorney with expertise in the specialized international arms transactions, said private U.S. businesses are playing a small but important role in the conflict.
“American companies are happy to export defense articles to foreign buyers approved by the U.S. State Department,” Bartlett said. “There’s an effort at the State Department to quickly clear the ones headed for Ukraine. … You get head-of-the-line privileges.”
Those sales also come with risks. 
Direct sales face fewer regulatory controls, oversight and enforcement, said Robert Nichols, an international military sales expert and attorney at the law firm Nichols Liu.
“You can imagine the range of characters involved in supplying a war effort,” Nichols said. “Some are highly credible. Others will skirt the law and sometimes step over the line by paying bribes, committing fraud and hiding their transactions.” 
So far, the Department of Justice has indicted just a handful of arms brokers over deals related to the war in Ukraine. Court records show the government has charged Miami-based Oleg Patsulya and Vasilii Besedin with illegally attempting to sell American-made aircraft parts to Russia. They allegedly lied to Commerce Department agents and told them the parts were bound for Turkey. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges this summer. 
A State Department spokesman declined to provide details of enforcement actions but said, “The United States takes seriously our responsibility to protect American military and dual-use technologies and prevent their diversion, including through strong enforcement actions.”
NATO said it oversees allied arms deliveries, and that those arms generally reach Ukraine. NATO itself technically only provides non-non-lethal aid, like fuel, medical supplies and generators.
Brown, of Battle Born, says he fields calls weekly from “clowns” without the proper licensing, whom he reports to the State Department for potential violations. Some raise red flags when they approach him about transactions that include payment via diamonds or gold.
He prefers traditional wire transfers with approved sales partners since he knows government officials are watching. He validates the contracts and checks certificates for the final users. That’s part of why he traveled with the ammunition. He would be meeting a Dutch military official for the official handoff.
“My job is to keep us all out of jail,” Brown said. 
The two 747s touched down in Poland, one before the sun, the other in late morning. Brown exchanged paperwork with a young Dutch military staffer who signed for the delivery, he said. They traded military patches as souvenirs. They snapped a photo together. 
The bullets bought by the Netherlands would never touch Dutch soil. 
U.S. aid:Billions from the US flows to Ukraine. Here's where it comes from, and how it adds up
Despite playing a small role proportionately in the war, $600 million in direct commercial sales can buy a lot of small weaponry. 
And those weapons are the kind most apt to fall into illicit use, said Elias Yousif, a research analyst at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit think tank.
Put another way: It’s hard to sneak away an F-16 or a missile launcher the size of a tractor-trailer. But a bunch of guns or a pallet of ammo? Much easier to resell. 
“In the commercial sector, especially in a new market, the risk increases,” Yousif said.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss arms research project, estimated that within a year, battlefield seizures and other forms of diversion led to 300,000 small arms and light weapons going missing, including 100,000 in Crimea alone.
When small arms go missing, they can go missing into another country, maybe one led by a despot or even a terrorist organization.
The U.S. government says diversion of American donations has been widely absent so far in Ukraine. That could be a combination of intensive “end-use-monitoring” programs and the reality of the battlefield, where supplies are rapidly put to use.
But even if not now, unused ammo could be resold someday. 
“History shows us this isn’t a short-term issue,” Yousif said.  “These are commodities with very long shelf lives.” 
Florida-based Global Ordnance, another State Department-licensed exporter, is a competitor in the direct weapons sales business. General counsel Bryan Van Brunt said the company has extensive protocols in place to track shipments and make sure the end-users are federally approved, though he declined to provide specifics about those systems. 
Brown, with Battle Born Munitions, says the company employs a mix of simple and sophisticated tracking technology to ensure his shipments are tracked to end users. The black GPS devices he dropped onto his cargo tracked the ammo all the way across the globe.
But that system only works as long as Brown is actually tracking. “Technically, my role ends when I deliver it to NATO,” he said.
Sometime after the 747s touched down in Poland, along with signing the paperwork and snapping a selfie with the Dutch official, Brown found the tiny black GPS trackers and lifted them off the pallets. 
Ukrainian trucks would arrive at the airport to pick up the ammunition. They would point toward the border, and onward to Lviv, and some distant battlefield. 
Brown would point in the opposite direction. Just like one of his quips: Fly in, have soup, get home. He headed toward Warsaw, with the GPS trackers in his bag.

The geography professor didn’t hide his clown fetish or the fact that he sometimes indulged his urges by recruiting students as subjects. He posted regularly about it on social media.
“I have a facepaint fetish and convince the cute girls in my classes to let me paint their faces,” he once wrote.
Yet Joseph Tokosh held jobs at two colleges and was on the tenure track at a third before student journalists at Nicholls State University in Louisiana exposed his behavior. He submitted his resignation the same day their story was published.
His interactions with students and open discussion of his fetish happened in both mainstream and tailored digital spaces. He popped into Facebook groups geared toward new students and niche forums on websites like Reddit. He posted videos on YouTube. In one Reddit post on a forum meant to highlight hard-to-believe stories, Tokosh posted pictures of several women in white face paint.
Over the years, two students reported him to campus police; others complained online. He left Kent State University after pleading no contest to something different: a theft charge that involved entering his peers’ offices without permission and taking a USB drive. Tokosh has not been charged with any other crime.
Tokosh’s career trajectory exposes inadequacies in the background check system that colleges and universities are supposed to have in place to protect students – especially when evidence of the concerning behavior resides largely on the internet. Nicholls State, for example, told USA TODAY Network reporters it does not routinely check social media for new hires.
A federal law intended to ensure the academic privacy of students also makes it difficult to determine how Tokosh was able to move so freely from campus to campus. Both Kent State and Northern Illinois University – where he taught while finishing his doctorate – noted Tokosh’s protected status as a graduate student in declining to answer questions.
Sophie Levan was a freshman at Kent State in 2017 when she encountered Tokosh, then 28, in a Facebook group intended as a gathering place for new students. Tokosh had offered cash to anyone willing to let him paint their faces. Levan, then 18, agreed.
The money was appealing but the interactions soured. 
Tokosh, she said, insisted he come pick her up and take her to the building that housed the geography department, where he would paint her face. Uneasy, Levan stopped responding. Tokosh got angry and wouldn’t give up, she said, which led her to file a police report.
“I felt like the school would want to know about it,” Levan said. “I thought maybe they could prevent anything bad from happening since other girls would go with him.”
She said there was never any followup from campus police – or anyone else.
USA TODAY Network reporters reviewed the experiences of six students who were the subject of Tokosh’s attention going back to his time at Kent State.
In addition to Levan, the other person who reported Tokosh to campus police could not be reached for comment. The two who expressed public concerns on social media told USA TODAY they never heard from their campus officials either.
USA TODAY attempted to reach Tokosh via phone, social media and a certified letter. A person answered a phone call to a number associated with Tokosh, but he hung up after the reporter identified himself. A reporter also reached someone who identified herself as Tokosh’s mother. She said she would pass along that reporters were trying to reach him.
Tokosh told the Nicholls student journalists that he did have an assignment where students were required to paint their faces as part of a cultural exercise. Prior to the article in the student newspaper The Nicholls Worth, the university had already cut Tokosh loose. He said his contract was not renewed because he was the target of a “grade inflation task force.”
The university, however, “does not have any such task force,” according to Nicholls spokesman Jerad David.
Tokosh also told students the face painting was a requirement in his cultural geography class to better understand other cultures. In a video interview with Hannah Robert, the station manager for the student-run KNSU TV, he says: “That's an assignment in one of my classes where they actually come up with their own face paint and makeup design inspired by a culture and they implement it.”
It’s a well-established trend in the academic world for professors to bounce from one institution to another without having to disclose why they left their last post, said Julie Libarkin, an associate dean at Michigan State University. She has seen the pattern often in her work maintaining a database of publicly documented sexual misconduct by faculty and staff.
As for grad students? Libarkin said people have requested she add them to her list, but universities’ conservative interpretations of the law get in the way.
“I don’t on purpose,” she said, “because that’s information that almost never comes out.”
Tokosh arrived at Kent State in 2015 with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in geography from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, according to his curriculum vitae. He was working toward his doctorate and researched fading businesses. His work about shopping malls in the Rust Belt won several awards. Like many graduate students, he also taught classes.
Then, Tokosh started showing up in the Facebook groups for new students. In a December 2017 post, an account under the name “Joe Tokosh” posted several pictures of women made up to look like clowns or skulls.
“If anyone is looking for some extra cash, I am looking for people to practice facepainting on!” he wrote. “I will literally pay you!”
Those are the types of posts that caught Levan’s eye. Not only was she pressed for cash, she was interested in movie makeup and thought the face painting could be fun based on the photos Tokosh had posted. But Levan said she soon realized that those images were stock photos and not representative of what Tokosh could do.
What’s more, she figured out that he was a graduate student, a fact she said he didn’t disclose in his posts.
When Tokosh offered to pick her up from her dorm, she refused. But, she said, Tokosh kept insisting she agreed to participate. Levan stopped responding to his messages and filed a police report with the Kent State police in January 2018. They advised her only to stop talking to Tokosh, she said, and let them know if “anything of consequence occurred.”
Months after she refused to meet up and filed the police report, Tokosh texted a picture of himself wearing white face paint to her cellphone. It arrived at midnight and contained no message, although writing on his shirt read: “I'm not a failure.”  
“There was some negative intention with sending that photo,” Levan said. “It’s definitely burned into my mind.”
What Levan didn’t know is that campus police had been put on notice a year earlier when another student filed a similar report. That student told police Tokosh reached out to her and her friends after they posted their numbers on a Facebook group for undergraduates. He would send “get to know you” messages, the police report said, and then ask the student if she was “interested in having her face painted for one of his class projects.”
When she found out Tokosh was a graduate student, she said no and eventually blocked him on Facebook and Snapchat, according to the report. Tokosh continued to text her.
“She does not have any concerns for her safety, but just wanted this documented,” the police report read. 
In July 2017, another student had retweeted a message from Kent State’s Twitter account that asked for Kent State love stories. She wrote: “A geography professor requested me on facebook and asked if he could paint my face like a clown.”
The student confirmed to USA TODAY that the professor was Tokosh and shared a screenshot of a Facebook friend request he sent her. She said she suspected Tokosh also found her on a freshman Facebook group because she posted there often.
She said she tweeted to draw officials’ attention to it and moved on but now wishes she had reported it officially.
College campuses are supposed to offer students special protections from sexual harassment even when it falls short of criminal behavior. Title IX, often associated with equity in women’s sports, also addresses “sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence” at schools that receive federal funding.
Colleges infrequently and unevenly enforce the rule, however. A 2022 USA TODAY investigation found just one of every 12,400 students was suspended in connection with sexual misconduct.
The student who shared her story online said the only response she received was from a graduate student in the geography department, who contacted her on Oct. 1, 2018. In an email, he wrote that he had seen her post and suspected he knew which faculty member had asked her about face painting.
“I brought it to the attention of some of our faculty because I was pretty sure I knew who it was, but they were certain it wasn’t that individual and that you probably just meant geology,” he wrote. 
He went on to reference another student being “approached in (at least by just looking at your tweet) a much more aggressive way.” The grad student asked the undergraduate for more information, but, she told USA TODAY, she didn’t respond. She said she started drafting a reply, but a year had passed. She wanted to move on.
Kent State would not say whether any actions were taken after the students’ reports, but Eric Mansfield, a spokesman for the university, said the police department confirmed that the students who filed police reports were provided with “university resources, which would include other non-criminal avenues to pursue (Counseling Services, Title IX, Center for Sexual and Relationship Violence Services, etc.) as a general police practice.”
Levan does not recall police offering her services, but she said she didn’t want counseling. She wanted Tokosh investigated.
Mansfield also said that the university monitors social media but that colleges “can’t always see or track every mention on social media.”
Police records show that officers did investigate when Tokosh was accused of breaking into geography department offices. A blotter item in the local newspaper shows police obtained an arrest warrant in connection with a third-degree felony burglary charge. Court documents indicate Tokosh pleaded no contest to a theft on Oct. 19, 2018.
Kent State would not explain what led to Tokosh’s departure during that fall semester. Instead, the university said that since Tokosh was a graduate student, any information about him was protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It also would not say whether school officials shared Tokosh’s disciplinary record with other colleges or even if it was standard practice to do so for grad students.
“Due to FERPA, student education records are private,” said Emily Vincent, a university spokeswoman. “Also, we do not comment on personnel matters.”
When Congress passed FERPA in 1974, its author, Sen. James L. Buckley of New York, said the intent was to protect the academic privacy of students and their families. In more recent years, Buckley has become critical of the law and how schools interpret it. He told the Columbus Dispatch in 2010 that “the law needs to be revamped.”
Survivors of sexual violence and students accuse universities of using the law to avoid negative media coverage. Students with a history of bad behavior may jump from one school to another without the public ever knowing about their histories. Law enforcement records don’t fall under FERPA’s purview, but a wide variety of questionable behavior does.
One case involved Brandon Austin, who was accused of sexual assault at Providence College in 2013 while on the school’s basketball team. But Providence College initially said Austin was suspended for violating the school’s code of student conduct and declined to share further details with the Providence Journal, citing federal privacy laws. Austin denied wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime. 
Austin was able to transfer to the University of Oregon, where he was again accused of sexual assault, along with other players. Police investigated the claims, and the local district attorney declined to press charges. The university expelled him anyway but raised FERPA when it declined to release records showing what Oregon knew about the allegations, according to the Oregonian.
LeRoy Rooker was the director of the U.S. Education Department office that oversaw FERPA for more than two decades. Rooker, now a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said FERPA is not a confidentiality law – it is focused on education records. And it doesn’t apply when a student is “seeking or intending to enroll” at another college.
Therefore, Rooker said, Kent State could have shared information about Tokosh with Northern Illinois.
Rooker also said FERPA would not have prevented Kent State from telling reporters if other universities had inquired about Tokosh, though they could not have disclosed what they shared.
He blamed the overuse of the law on fear of being sued.
“In this litigious age, institutions get a little wonky about whether they will forward, say, disciplinary records,” Rooker said. “On the other hand, if you have something and you don’t share it when you can and something happens at the next institution, I would say that’s a big liability.”
Backgrounding job applicants has become increasingly complex.
While most U.S. employers conduct background screening, according to trade group data, those inquiries typically focus on criminal history. Social media receives far less attention even though that is where people are most likely to share their unguarded thoughts.
Undertaking a full review of a person’s social media presence is more difficult than just checking an applicant’s Facebook page.
Does an applicant have an account on X, formerly Twitter? How about an account with Discord, an online platform frequented by gamers, where leaked Pentagon documents were recently shared? Or what about a Telegram account, a messaging platform popular among white nationalists? Further complicating things, it’s common on sites like Reddit for users to adopt usernames and describe experiences with little to no ties to reality.
A little digging, however, can turn up a lot of dirt.  
Tokosh has a LinkedIn page that includes his teaching stints at Northern Illinois University and Nicholls State University. His time as a student and instructor at Kent State is absent.
For LinkedIn, a custom URL includes a play on his name and his chosen field of study: Joeography. Tokosh would later use that moniker in promotional materials for a class at Nicholls State. That is the same handle used on Reddit by someone with a special interest in face paint.
One post features a video of Tokosh throwing a pie at someone. Other posts mention a “clown fetish.” In a forum titled “Creepy,” he wrote, “I convince pretty girls to let me paint their faces,” along with a photo with multiple women in white face paint.
That and other similar posts remained live for years until they were taken down after the Nicholls students published their story in late March.
USA TODAY Network reporters captured screenshots before they disappeared. With dates in 2019, the posts feature a young woman wearing a Kent State T-shirt. The material would have been available to administrators at Northern Illinois before the start of the fall 2019 semester.
Joe King, a spokesman for Northern Illinois, said departments hiring new graduate students are “not required to check social media or investigate a disciplinary history.” He added some departments may reach out to the graduate students’ former advisers.
King said he could not determine if the university was aware of Tokosh’s behavior at Kent State. He said that due to FERPA, he could not share specifics about Tokosh’s time at Northern Illinois, including whether students had complained about him.
But there are signs the behavior continued.
A YouTube account under the name “Joe Tokosh” included at least two videos in 2020 of a man throwing pies at women. One of the videos features a young woman also seen in the screenshots from Tokosh’s Reddit account. 
Comments on one from October 2020 read: “You can have a video of her tied up getting pied via cash app.” That video was viewed more than 30,000 times before it was turned off in late July, around the time a USA TODAY reporter reached out to Tokosh.
A former Northern Illinois State student shared text messages exchanged with Tokosh in which he asked to paint her face on multiple occasions. USA TODAY has agreed not to name her because she is concerned Tokosh might retaliate against her.
In the text messages, Tokosh shared a photo of a young woman in white face paint – an image also posted to the Joeography Reddit account. She said she declined to do it but was aware that other Northern Illinois students had participated.
By fall 2022, when he had moved on to Nicholls, Tokosh revealed to the student that he had required students in his cultural geography class to paint their faces.  
The Northern Illinois student asked Tokosh what he did with the photos, and she said he suggested that he might spin them off into a research project someday. She asked, had anyone complained? She said Tokosh responded: Why would they?
Many students would find a reason to complain, as Nicholls State student journalist Sally-Anne Torres learned firsthand. It started in January when one of her fellow reporters picked up an odd rumor: a professor was offering extra credit for students willing to paint their faces like clowns. Initially, Torres dismissed it because it seemed too unusual and there weren’t a lot of leads to follow. 
By Feb. 7, university administrators informed Tokosh that his contract would not be renewed, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY via a records request. They gave no reason for the nonrenewal, but on Feb. 12, Tokosh emailed his students that the university was letting him go. He blamed his departure on giving too many A’s.
That seemed suspicious to Torres. 
During her reporting, she received a tip about Tokosh’s Reddit posts in which he wrote of his “clown fetish” and how he enlisted his students to participate in it.
“It wasn’t just this innocent thing that a lot of these girls thought it was,” Torres said. “As a professor or teacher, that is somebody students are supposed to trust. He used his power to ruin that trust and to do these things, and that made me angry for them.”
Torres spoke to six students who shared their experiences with Tokosh. Some, she said, were followed on Twitter by him while others opted into an extra credit assignment he offered.
The women told Torres he sometimes giggled and laughed as they painted their faces in his office.
On March 27, the Nicholls Worth published a story headlined, “Geography professor suspended immediately, students allege sexual harassment.” KNSU TV, a student broadcast network, also aired footage in which Tokosh defended the assignment on camera. That same day, Tokosh submitted his resignation.
The story’s publication prompted other students to come forward about Tokosh and their frustration with the university.
Bradley Price took an online class with Tokosh and said the professor required students to photograph themselves with their faces painted. Price said Tokosh told them the assignment was to help them understand Japanese culture, but then Tokosh offered him bonus points if he could get a female friend to paint her face.
It seemed unusual at the time, Price said, because his friend wasn’t in the class. It became more concerning to him on reading the student newspaper’s report.
“I feel frankly disgusted and disappointed that Nicholls couldn’t do a proper background check on this professor, because this is unacceptable,” Price said. 
Bella Ramos, a junior at Nicholls State who did not take any of Tokosh’s classes, told USA TODAY that someone using the handle @Joeography21 followed her on Twitter in late 2021 and started liking all her selfies.
Ramos learned that the person behind the account was likely a professor at the university. She posted about the behavior in January 2022, but nothing came of it. She also found the Joeography Reddit account. On March 27, the same day the student newspaper published its piece, Ramos posted screenshots of her discoveries on Twitter with the message, “Found a Nicholls state university professor on Reddit.”
“I wish the university had acted sooner because all this information was public on the internet,” she told USA TODAY. 
No one from the university, she said, has ever reached out.

The United Nations is calling for Israel to rescind an immediate evacuation order it issued for about a million Palestinians living in Gaza, with the U.N. calling the order "horrendous" and warning of a deepening humanitarian crisis.
The Israeli military announced the Gaza evacuation Friday. It's an unprecedented order for about half the population of the sealed-off territory ahead of an expected ground invasion against the ruling Hamas militant group. Palestinians have said there is no real escape in Gaza, which has been under a suffocating 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt. 
"The scale and speed of the unfolding humanitarian crisis is bone-chilling. Gaza is fast becoming a hell hole and is on the brink of collapse," the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said in a Friday statement. "The call from Israeli Forces to move more than 1,000,000 civilians living in northern Gaza within 24 hours is horrendous. This will only lead to unprecedented levels of misery and further push people in Gaza into the abyss."
Hamas, which staged a shocking and brutal attack on Israel nearly a week ago and has fired thousands of rockets since, dismissed the evacuation as a ploy and called on people to stay in their homes.
Alarmed civilians and aid workers, who were already in distress from Israeli airstrikes and a blockade, were sent into chaos. Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City, told The Associated Press through tears that there was no way one million people could evacuate that fast.
“Forget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel. The only concern now is just if you make it, if you’re going to live,” Farsakh said.

Developments:
∎ The number of Palestinians displaced increased by 25% over the past 24 hours, according to an early Friday update from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. More than 423,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza and two-thirds are taking shelter at U.N schools.
∎ Airstrikes have left cities and refugee camps in ruins. And Gaza has been experiencing a full electricity blackout amid Israel's siege of the territory, "which has brought essential health, water and sanitation services to the brink of collapse, and exacerbated food insecurity" according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz has said electricity, water and fuel will not be provided until Israeli hostages are returned.
∎ Public officials and law enforcement agencies across the United States have expressed concern over potential protests on Friday in response to Hamas leadership's call for a global "Day of Rage." The D.C. region has enhanced its security in the area, including in the U.S. Capitol complex, and other major cities have also been on alert.
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.
Gaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian exclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.
Hamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.

WASHINGTON – A giant chunk of marble at least two feet long crashed into an interior courtyard of the Supreme Court last year, according to an Associated Press report Friday.
No one was injured, though the courtyard is used regularly by the justices and their aides. Justice Elena Kagan and her law clerks had been in the courtyard earlier in the day, the AP reported, citing court employees.
It's not the first time such an incident has taken place at the Supreme Court. A basketball-sized chunk of marble fell off the building in 2005, landing on the court’s front marble steps. No one was injured in that incident.
A Supreme Court spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The courtyard is currently closed for renovation, the AP reported, work that had been planned before the marble fell.
Civilians and aid workers who were already struggling amid the war between Israel and Hamas have been sent into chaos following an order to evacuate Gaza City. Also in the news: The House speaker search continues after frontrunner Steve Scalise stepped aside and the Philadelphia Phillies had a history-making win over the Atlanta Braves in the National League Division Series.

Here we go with Friday's headlines.
The Israel Defense Forces called for the evacuation of all civilians in Gaza City early Friday, on the heels of what the United Nations said was a warning they received from Israel to evacuate 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza within 24 hours.
The Israeli alert could signal an imminent ground offensive. Israel has been bombarding Gaza with airstrikes, killing more than 1,500 people. A White House spokesman said Thursday the U.S. death toll from the Hamas attacks last weekend rose to 27 and 14 remain missing.

The House fell into further chaos Thursday night after Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., withdrew from the speaker's race despite being formally nominated by the House Republican conference, underscoring the deep divisions that have consumed GOP lawmakers. Scalise, who served as House Majority Leader, the No. 2 ranking House Republican, was largely expected to launch a speakership bid following the historic ouster of the chamber's former speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Read more

Americans need to stand behind Israel − and that includes former President Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said Thursday. “While we have their back now that they’ve been hit, what’s more important is that we have their back when they hit back,” Haley said at a New Hampshire town hall sponsored by the USA TODAY Network. The former ambassador to the United Nations said Hamas must be eliminated and “we need to remember who the true backer of all this is – Iran.” Read our recap of the town hall.
Talks bitterly broke off between Hollywood actors and studios this week, killing any hopes that the three-month strike by performers would come to an end anytime soon. The studios announced that they had suspended contract negotiations, saying the gap between the two sides was too great to make continuing worth it, despite an offer as good as the one that recently ended the writers strike. The actors union decried their opponents’ “bullying tactics” and said they were wildly mischaracterizing their offers. Read more
Kansas City stifled the Denver Broncos 19-8 on “Thursday Night Football.” It's the Chiefs’ 16th straight victory over their AFC West rival. And yes, there was a famous pop singer watching from the suite section of Arrowhead Stadium cheering on tight end Travis Kelce, who was questionable entering the game with an ankle injury. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes didn’t play a great game by his standards, but he was still the best player on the field Thursday. Mahomes went 30-for-40 passing for 306 yards. He tossed one touchdown and one interception and finished with a passer rating of 94.4. Read more
In another epic National League Division Series battle between the NL East rivals, the Phillies dispatched the 104-win Braves for the second consecutive year, as three home runs and one throat-grabbing bullpen escape keyed a 3-1 win in Game 4 Thursday night at Citizens Bank Park. Nick Castellanos, who hit a pair of home runs off Atlanta ace Spencer Strider, becoming the first player in major league history to hit two home runs in consecutive playoff games. Read more

Associated Press contributed reporting.
The attacks came by land, sea, air – and online. 
Terror propaganda − violent videos and graphic images of kidnappings and murders of civilians and soldiers that flooded social media from the deadly cross-border incursion into Israel − was a key element in Hamas’ military campaign, said Graham Brookie, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.
Hamas streamed from the war zone “in closer to real-time than in past conflicts,” indicating that the online strategy “was an essential part of the overall planning for their attack on Israel” to take advantage of how hyperconnected Israel is with its widespread use of smartphones and social media, Brookie said.
Veterans of conflict zones on Brookie’s team tracking Hamas' digital footprint were struck by the ferocity and volume of the footage, the likes of which they had never seen, he said.
The effects could become more grave if Hamas makes good on a threat to broadcast executions of hostages, Brookie said. Some Hamas officials have since walked back the threat.
Spreading propaganda on social media networks – especially those with more lax moderation systems – is a low-cost and highly effective tactic that is increasingly being deployed by terrorist groups, said Colin P. Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group, a global intelligence and security consultancy.
The videos and images from the deadly attacks posted by Hamas-affiliated accounts were shared by Hamas allies and unwitting participants around the globe, Clarke said.
The tactic is pulled from the playbooks of the Islamic State and al-Qaida, which experts said pioneered the viral form of psychological warfare by livestreaming beheadings and other graphic footage.
“This is the nature of asymmetric warfare – you've got to utilize tools that are going to make you seem bigger and more powerful than you are,” Clarke said. “For Hamas, it costs them nothing to videotape something and send it out there, and now everyone thinks that they're creeping around every corner.”
Hamas fired off posts from official accounts on the encrypted messaging and social media app Telegram that ricocheted to X, formerly Twitter, and beyond. 
Telegram – which allows messaging between users but also has a “Channel” function that works similarly to X – has a long history of being used by terrorists, among them the Islamic State, or ISIS. The platform, often labeled by extremism experts as “Terrorgram,” is increasingly embraced by domestic extremists in the U.S. in recent years because of its almost nonexistent moderation. 
“As soon as something posts on Telegram, we see this crossflow of content to mainstream platforms, either intentionally or just through the oxygen of amplification,” Brookie said.
X, which gutted its trust and safety teams under new owner Elon Musk, was unprepared for the wave of terror propaganda that then spread to other social media platforms and messaging apps like WhatsApp.
This week, X said it was removing newly created Hamas-affiliated accounts and coordinating with industry peers “to try and prevent terrorist content from being distributed online.” It also recommended that people adjust their sensitive media settings if they don’t want to see disturbing content. 
The U.K. summoned social media executives Wednesday to demand platforms remove violent content of the Hamas attacks on Israel.
Telegram and X did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
If social media sites continue to erode guardrails and safeguards, Clarke warned, what is happening today will get worse.
“This is just the facet of what’s called ‘fourth generation warfare,’ or ‘modern warfare’ in this era,” he said. “So, whatever the next conflict is, it doesn't really matter, you're going to see this on steroids.”   
Once propaganda and disinformation reaches X, the platform is allowing it to be shared and even monetized, a report from the Tech Transparency Project found.
The report, an advance copy of which was provided exclusively to USA TODAY, found several premium subscriber accounts – which pay a fee of $8 a month to the platform – sharing Hamas propaganda including violent and graphic images of the attacks on Israel.
According to the report, some video content appears to violate X’s “violent and hateful entities policy,” which prohibits promotion of terrorist organizations and their propaganda. It also appears to violate an X policy stating that the platform will remove accounts sharing content produced by terrorists, the report states.
Despite X’s announcement that it was working to remove Hamas-affiliated accounts, TTP researchers "found no evidence that X had restricted the accounts sharing the Hamas attack videos,” the report says. It also notes that in some cases, X ran advertisements in the comments under the video posts.
The TTP report found several instances of “verified” X users, some with more than 500,000 followers, spreading uncensored Hamas propaganda videos. 
One clip posted to X shows bodycam footage of Hamas militants going room-to-room in an Israeli military base firing automatic weapons. Bloodied bodies lie on the ground in the video, which has been watched more than 60,000 times.   
“It's been nearly 10 years since the Islamic State made heavy use of social media to amplify its propaganda and recruitment efforts. Although some platforms have improved at reducing the spread of Islamic State content, today we see Hamas deploying very similar tactics on X,” TTP director Katie A Paul told USA TODAY. “The company has monetized the spread of Hamas propaganda despite its clear violations of X policy. X needs to effectively enforce the rules it has on the books as the conflict continues.”  
Brookie says social media platforms are being forced to grapple with a multi-front crisis to shield users from terror propaganda, misleading information, hate speech and violent and graphic images and footage.
“The amount of content is going to be more than any team, whether it’s at a platform or a research team like mine, or a journalism outlet or organization could possibly sift through,” he said. “That changes the frame from who’s doing well to who’s doing the least bad in a hard situation.” 
The major platforms are working with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) which was founded by Facebook, Microsoft, X and YouTube in 2017 to prevent terrorists and violent extremists from exploiting digital platforms. 
“In this rapidly evolving situation, we continue to work with our members to identify and follow trends in content and activity online related to terrorist and violent extremist actors involved in the offline violence,” GIFCT said in a statement. “This includes the possibility that a range of terrorist and violent extremist networks and groups may seek to exploit the conflict for their own purposes, as we have seen in past events.”
Facebook, YouTube and TikTok say they have poured resources into moderating content from the Israel-Hamas war. 
“After the terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel on Saturday, we quickly established a special operations center staffed with experts, including fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers, to closely monitor and respond to this rapidly evolving situation,” Meta said in a statement.
The major platforms prohibit content produced by terrorist organizations including Hamas as well as footage showing hostages. 
Apple’s fall device drop gets all the love, but Google wants you to remember it’s here, too – with lots of shiny new tech and some seriously impressive artificial intelligence upgrades coming soon to a phone near you.
Let’s break down everything Google just announced and see how the Pixel 8 stacks up against the new iPhone 15.
I write about the latest tech gear, security alerts and digital life hacks in my daily emails.Join 600K+ who get the Current each day. It’s free!
Batting 1,000
That’s how much the Google Pixel 8 Pro costs (OK, it’s $999) – up $100 from the top-tier 7 model. For a grand, it includes Google’s zippy Tensor G3 chip and a camera good enough to rival the iPhone 15. Neat feature: Zoom Enhance lets you go in and add details after you’ve taken the shot and want to zoom in on a pic.
The other random but excellent addition is a temperature sensor that can accurately measure how hot or cold a surface, object and even your forehead is.
It comes in black, porcelain and light blue – shipping is expected on Thursday.
Speaking of Google … 20 Google Search tricks, hidden utilities, games and freebies
What about the non-Pro?
The Pixel 8 is going up $100, too. It’s faster and slightly smaller than the 7 – and gets access to Google’s sweet new AI photo editing tools (along with the 8 Pro).
◾ Magic Editor uses AI to change the scenery in a photo, remove distracting elements and even move people around.
◾ Best Take is a group-shot game changer. The idea is you take several pictures, and then you can choose the best face for each subject and merge them into one final image. Finally, everyone looks good!
◾ Audio Magic Eraser tones down distracting sounds in audio tracks that are ruining your video.
The 8 is $699, or $799 if you’re buying from Verizon. It comes in rose, black and hazel and is expected to ship on Thursday too.
Updates till 2030
Hey, at least if you spend all the money, you know your phone will work for many years. Google says the 8 and 8 Pro get seven years of “OS, security, and Feature Drop updates” for both phones.

How do they stack up against the new iPhones?
For most people, it comes down to what ecosystem you prefer. If you’ve been using one or the other for years, you know exactly how they work and are comfortable with the OS.
Perhaps you’re not so brand loyal. Let’s compare some specs, shall we? We’ll stick with the base models.
iPhone 15 vs. Pixel 8
◾ Cost: $799 to $1,099 (iPhone); $699 to $749 (Pixel)
I’ll let you draw your own conclusions, but on specs alone, the Pixel models are totally solid for the price. (And yes, I say that as an iPhone devotee.)
Beyond the phones, here’s what else Google is working on.
More battery life, better sensors
The Pixel Watch 2 looks like the original, but the insides got a significant upgrade. The improved Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 processor means up to 24 hours of battery life, even with the always-on display enabled.
It’s outfitted with new skin temperature and electrodermal activity sensors to tell how stressed you are, along with additional heart rate sensors for more accurate readings and automatic workout tracking.
You’re looking at $349.99 for the GPS version or $399.99 for LTE. Pick from silver and blue, silver and white, gold and hazel, or all-black.
Can you hear me, Buds?
The Pixel Buds are Google’s answer to the AirPods. The upgraded Buds Pro get light blue and porcelain options to match the new phones, along with audio upgrades for “fuller and clearer” sound. They’re $199.99.
Assistant gets smarter
It wouldn’t be 2023 if there weren’t some AI talk. Google Assistant is getting a Bard AI upgrade “in the coming months.” It’ll connect with your Google apps – like Gmail, Drive and Calendar – to plan trips, caption pictures, make lists and find that dinner reservation you forgot about.

I really like the new Apple Watch Series 9. It reminds me a lot of my Apple Watch Series 8.
I’ve been evaluating the latest smartwatches from Apple, Samsung and Google. And at first blush, separating this year’s models from their predecessors seems a little like deciphering whether that SUV in the parking lot is a 2019 or 2020 Chevy Tahoe.
That’s good news if you splurged for a new smartwatch last fall, because your investment is anything but obsolete. By the same token, there’s more to this year’s models than powder-coated wheel finishes and trim decals. So if you’re considering an upgrade after a few years – or even switching teams – there’s plenty to consider.
Apple and Samsung have turned it up to … 2,000. That’s 2,000 nits, a measure of brightness, Which is, like, really bright.
Both the new Apple Watch Series 9 (starting at $399 for 41mm, $529 as tested, 45mm aluminum with LTE) and the Samsung Watch 6 Classic (starting at $369.99 for 43mm, $449.99 as tested, 47mm stainless steel with LTE) are incredibly easy to read – even here, in the extreme desert sun. For some reason, I found the Series 9’s 2,000-nit display to be somewhat brighter and crisper than the Watch 6 Classic’s 2,000-nit display.
The Google Pixel Watch 2 (starting at $349.99, $399.99 as tested with LTE) checks in at 1,000 nits, the same as the inaugural Pixel Watch as well as last year’s offerings from Samsung and Apple. Although it pales in comparison to the 2,000-nit displays, I can still read the 1,000-nit screens outside. And if you’re more likely to read a message in Scarsdale than Scottsdale, then the new 2,000-nit options may not have the same appeal.
Apple Watch Series 9 (iOS)
Apple also upgraded the Watch’s internal processors, which the company credits for a few new features, like “Double Tap.” The Double Tap hand gesture – the Watch detects when you quickly press your thumb and middle fingers together – can help control the device when you can’t reach over with your other hand to answer a call or scan alerts. In my beta-testing of the feature, it worked a lot like “Assistive Touch,” which Apple introduced two years ago, only a bit snappier.
The added horsepower also gives Siri offline capabilities that improve the voice assistant’s speed and accuracy.
iOS updates again?:Apple is urging everyone to update iPhone and iPad iOS (again). Why you should do it now.
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (Android)
A lot of what’s new-and-improved with Samsung’s flagship smartwatch actually comes from Google’s Wear OS, which Samsung recommitted to a couple years ago. The Watch 6 Classic is livelier and more responsive than the Watch 5 Pro, with better graphics for alerts and more engaging apps. And sleep tracking seems to be more reliable, accurate and – as a consequence – relevant.
Although the processor and sensors are largely identical, the Watch 6 Classic is easier to visually identify because Samsung brought back a popular engagement tool: the rotating bezel.
Google Pixel Watch 2 (Android)
The Google offering, available Thursday, endured the most substantial changes year over year, by far. But it is just the second iteration of a formidable undertaking to meld the popular fitness platform from Fitbit, which Google bought four years ago, with the premium Wear OS smartwatch ecosystem. It’s already spawned a worthy contender. But there’s still a lot to do.
The Pixel Watch 2 boasts a new, more accurate heartrate sensor that is much better at tracking vigorous activity. There’s now a temperature sensor as well as cEDA for stress monitoring. It has an upgraded processor and more durable glass. It also runs the new Wear OS 4, just like Samsung’s Watch 6 series.
The Fitbit/Wear mix-and-match journey is most evident when the two platforms have a different approach to the same task. For example, Fitbit’s all-in-one app is at odds with how Wear OS – and other vendors as well, for that matter – on-board and configure hardware. That has made it challenging for Fitbit to add Google features to its devices, just as it has been for Google to add Fitbit’s app to its devices.
It is also making it challenging to swap back and forth between the Pixel Watch 2 and the original Watch or – more difficult – traditional Fitbit devices. I’m juggling three wearables right now – the new Fitbit Charge 6 as well as the two Pixel Watches – and it can be downright aggravating. Conversely, that process is automatic and hassle-free for those swapping Apple or Samsung devices. Samsung’s relative ease at handling the task is particularly illustrative, given that Google’s own Wear OS is managing the handoff.
Through it all, the 41mm Pixel Watch 2 is an attractive, well-built watch with a great health and fitness pedigree. I wish Google would offer two sizes, as Apple and Samsung do. I prefer the beefier, 45mm-47mm options. Hopefully Google will get around to that in future revisions.
I also wish Google would offer better battery life. But I’m not holding my breath.
Online hate surge:Online hate surges after Hamas attacks Israel. Why everyone is blaming social media.
Unfortunately, Big Tech seems content to offer mediocre battery life for their pricey, high-powered smartwatches. Apple has never promised more than a waking day between charges on full power.
That obviously hasn’t hurt Apple – and Samsung has taken a cue. The Watch 6 Classic simply matches Apple battery life, rather than beating it with 36- to 48-hour battery life, as in previous generations.
Most disappointing is Google, which is foregoing Fitbit’s multiday battery legacy by providing up to just 24 hours of power in the Pixel Watch 2.
Multiday battery life would be a major upgrade. It’s not only more convenient. It also makes smartwatches more engaging. For one thing, it dramatically boosts the likelihood of tracking sleep, one of the most crucial health indicators.
Battery life aside, these are three very good watches to choose from. So if you’re kicking the tires on a new model, don’t let the recycled styling dissuade you. The Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch series are both locked in after years of refinement. And while it’s comparatively early on for the Pixel Watch series, Google has done a good job so far combining two very established platforms.

The concept that we are all computer-generated characters occupying a world as real as the ones gamers explore on their PlayStation consoles isn't exactly a new one.
As far back as 1999, Morpheus was entering "The Matrix" to break Neo and a few other chosen few out of a simulated reality created by advanced machines in order to use humans as an energy source. But as the idea permeates not just the realm of science fiction and popular culture, but academia as well, every now and then a philosopher or physicist has something new to say about it.
That's what happened this week when a physicist at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom proposed that a new law of physics could support the theory that what we see as our reality is in fact a complex virtual simulation running on a cosmic computer. The theory stems from previous research that Dr. Melvin Vopson has conducted looking into whether information has mass.
"Any normal person will think, could it be that maybe we already are in some kind of digital virtual reality world?" Vopson said in a March video posted on the university's YouTube channel.
"It's not farfetched to assume that an advanced civilization or maybe ourselves in the future, we reach the technological level where we can simulate our world or the whole universe and it's indistinguishable from the reality."
Psyche mission, explained:What to know about NASA's long-awaited trip to a strange metal asteroid
The idea that the cosmos runs on quantum codes has existed for years, becoming popularized in academia in 2003 when philosopher Nick Bostrom of the University of Oxford wrote an influential paper about the simulation argument.
In principle, anything can be simulated with a computer with sufficient power. Bostrom argued that for advanced civilizations, such an intricate simulation would be rather easy for those wanting to explore their histories or entertain their children.
The theory is popular among many notable figures, including Elon Musk. The Tesla founder and CEO weighed in at a 2016 conference, stating that in his opinion, the odds that we're living in what he called "base reality" — in other words, the real universe as opposed to a simulated one — are “one in billions.”
So are we not unlike the characters we oversee in the Sims, confined to a superficial, restricted sandbox while more advanced beings are spectators to our existence?
It's hard to say, as the theory is as hard to disprove as it it to prove. In fact, 2020 research authored by David Kipping, an astronomer at Columbia University, found that the odds of us living in a base reality are pretty much 50-50, with the odds only slightly in favor of our universe not being simulated.

Prada in space:Famed Italian fashion house will help design NASA's spacesuits for mission to the moon
Vopson's latest research stems from the abstract concept that information is the fundamental building block of the universe and has both energy and physical mass.
"My questions was, where is that information going when the bit is at equilibrium and is stored information?" he said in the Youtube video. "Energy can't exist on its own, it needs to be in some form."
It's the belief of Vopson and others working in the field of science known as information physics that our physical reality could be made up of bits of information, which aren't unlike the cells of living organisms that are coded with DNA containing valuable information about themselves.
After studying digital data storage and an RNA genome, Vopson discovered in 2022 that information systems don't appear to conform to the second law of thermodynamics. That law essentially dictates that any naturally occurring process will result in a loss of energy and increase in a system's measure of disorder, or entropy (think of an ice cube that gradually melts when placed in a cup of water at room temperature.)
In fact, Vopson discovered that the entropy in information systems actually decreases, leading him to establish what he calls the second law of information dynamics.
Vopson recently set out to apply the discovery to genetics, cosmology, atomic physics, symmetry and yes, even the simulation hypothesis. Published last week in AIP Advances, Vopson's paper provides an explanation for how the removal of excess information in our universe resembles the process of a computer deleting or compressing unneeded code to save storage space and conserve power.
In short, it's a process he said could support the idea that we may be living in a Matrix-style artificial reality akin to a computer simulation, where we and anything else we perceive is nothing more than a virtual facsimile.
"It doesn't prove entirely that," Vopson said in the video. "It underpins the concept through empirical evidence, but it doesn't mean necessarily that is totally the consensus that is happening; it is one possibility."

The movie "Snakes on a Plane" dramatized perhaps the worst things to encounter on a flight, but imagine being stuck on a real-world plane with a swarm of mosquitos.
It happened to a local flight in Mexico, which was delayed for more than two hours from its scheduled departure time of 4:30 p.m., due to a mosquito infestation, local media reported. Cabin crew and ground staff tried to get the situation under control by spraying mosquito and insect repellent in the cabins. It eventually took off at 6:59 p.m., according to the flight's history.
The flight, VOI221 operated by Volaris Airlines, was traveling within Mexico from Guadalajara to Mexico City on Friday, October 6, according to Storyful.

Video footage from the incident, recorded by a passenger, shows the airplane's cabin filled with fumes as flight attendants spray insect repellent to counteract the swarm of mosquitoes buzzing around the cabin. The flight appeared to be ready for takeoff, with all passengers seated. Some of them could be heard screaming in the video, while others swatted the insects away.
As the airlines staff sprayed the mosquito repellent, the insects became more agitated reported the local media outlet El Sol de León.
They did not settle down until all the lights were turned off, a passenger told Storyful.
This is not the first time that a swarm of mosquitos attacked a flight taking off from the Guadalajara International Airport. A similar incident took place in 2019. El Sol de León said that the area in which the airport is located is close to contaminated water bodies and vegetation, both of which are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Favorable weather conditions also contribute to increasing mosquito populations.
Airport authorities have recognized this as a problem, reported El Sol de León, and have taken steps such as draining water, pruning grass and spraying insecticides to curb the problem.
Volaris Airlines did not immediately respond to USA TODAY'S request for a comment.

2023 was the year of all things pink, thanks to Greta Gerwig's "Barbie", so it comes as no surprise that a community in Utah made "Barbie" the theme of this year's Halloween, bringing the pink paradise to life in South Jordan, a city approximately 20 miles south of Salt Lake City.
"One of my neighbors bought us all tickets for "Barbie" and we went to see the movie together. And as we were leaving, we were like, 'Oh my gosh, you guys. Barbie is gonna be the Halloween theme this year'," Liz Gallegos, one of the people behind the idea and a resident of Daybreak told USA TODAY.
Building upon her idea, Gallegos' neighbor's daughter Miley suggested they turn their neighborhood into "Barbieland," an idea that everyone loved.
Come September, the residents got to work, dressing up their houses in different themes, including the Mojo Dojo Casa house, Pool Party Barbie and Dream House Barbie.
Gallegos said around seven members of the community were already onboard because they saw the movie together and were in on the plan from the beginning. They invited other neighbors to participate as well, ultimately ending up with 18 houses dressed up in the Barbieland theme.
They left no stone unturned, paying attention to even the minutest of details and adding elements from Barbieland including a pool slide, horses, and neon signs that read, “You guys ever think about dying?” and “RIP the patriarchy” tombstones.
The house concepts include:
Thanks 'Barbie'!Blockbuster film joins 'Oppenheimer' in boosting summer box office sales
Photos:Barbie's Malibu dream house is back on Airbnb, but this time Ken is hosting for free
Gallegos said that her neighborhood is very special and unique in the sense that their community is tight knit, especially because their houses face each other instead of the street.
"What's really special and unique is that most people in Daybreak care a lot about Halloween. We have historically gone pretty big for Halloween. We've had a 'Harry Potter' house, a 'Stranger Things' house, an 'Encanto' house. So, we've always kind of gone above and beyond for Halloween."
Kenzie Bates, an event organizer based in Lehi, Utah who has previously designed Harry Potter and Encanto-themed houses told USA TODAY that Gallegos reached out to her with the idea of making people experience Barbieland, even if it was only for a day.
Kenzie, worked with the residents of Daybreak, as the creative director of the setup, sourcing decorations and props for them including a life-size horse, signs for the houses and other custom-built items.
While many elements from Barbieland were incorporated into the setup, some residents also wanted to keep the spirit of Halloween alive, so they included elements such as gravestones and skeletons. In fact, there is a gravestone dedicated to Ruth Handler, the founder of Mattel, the company that produces Barbie dolls.
"Some people were very much into Halloween, and they didn't want to lose sight of it, so they went with themes like haunted Barbie and graveyard Barbie," Kenzie said.
Barbieland is attracting thousands of people, both Gallegos and Bates said, adding that the little island is so busy during the month of October that it's "very hard" to get on and off the bridge that connects their neighborhood to South Jordan. Daybreak is a housing community in South Jordan, with one part of it situated on an island and surrounded by a moat.
"I mean, we knew that people in Daybreak would care because they love Halloween," said Gallegos. "But none of us had any idea that anyone outside of our little neighborhood would care at all."
She said that she posted a few videos on TikTok on the suggestion of her friends, and they soon went viral, with people sending in requests to come and see the setup. At least two of the videos hit more than 2 million views on TikTok.
"I feel like it's a landmark or something," said Gallegos. "We have people at our house starting at like 8 a.m. even though we usually turn on lights and music around 5:30 p.m. in the evening. During the day we'll just have moms or kids or strollers coming by, but by the late afternoon and early evening, it really starts picking up and between like 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., it's just a constant stream of people like every single night, no matter what night of the week it is."
Gallegos said that the local police force was also taken aback by the number of people and traffic jams.
However, Gallegos and her neighbors do not mind the attention or influx of people.
"It honestly makes me so happy because there's a lot of really sad stuff in the world right now," Gallegos shared. "It's hard to keep your chin up every day. So, it's nice, happy, small little things that are making people happy."

A fishing trip became a life-changing event for Phil Garner when he came across an orphaned duck.
Phil was at a fishing pond with his son when a bedraggled duckling latched onto them. With no sign of the duck’s family, Garner was encouraged by the pond owner to take the bird home as otherwise it would most likely have died.
Back at his house in Allerton Bywater, near Leeds, England, Phil and his wife, Julia, nursed the duck back to health and named her Freda.
After 18 months of living with them, Freda disappeared. But a few months later, she returned with a big surprise for her owners.
Watch the video below to see what Freda brought back when she returned to her home

Jurors convicted a Colorado police officer Thursday and acquitted a former officer of charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a Black man who died after being stopped by police in a Denver suburb, restrained and injected with ketamine.
Aurora police officer Randy Roedema, 41, was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and third-degree assault. The 12-person jury found Jason Rosenblatt, 34, who was fired in 2020, not guilty on all charges.
Roedema and Rosenblatt were the first two of five police officers and paramedics to stand trial over charges linked to McClain's death, which gained renewed attention amid nationwide protests following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020.
A local prosecutor initially declined to bring criminal charges over McClain's death partly because of an inconclusive initial autopsy report, but the group was indicted in 2021 after Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser launched a grand jury investigation.
McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, listened to the verdict from the front row, where Weiser had his hand on her shoulder. She held her right hand high in a raised fist as she left the courtroom.
"This is the divided states of America, and that’s what happens," Sheneen McClain said as she walked away from the courthouse.
“Today’s verdict is about accountability; everyone is accountable and equal under the law. And hopefully today’s verdict is another step in the healing process for the Aurora community and the state,” Weiser said in a statement.
Aurora Police Chief Art Acevedo also released a statement Thursday, saying the department respected the verdict handed down by the jury.
“I know many have been waiting a long time for the involved parties to have their day in court. As a nation, we must be committed to the rule of law. As such, we hold the American judicial process in high regard,” Acevedo said, adding: "Due to the additional pending trials, the Aurora Police Department is precluded from further comment at this time."
Is it easier to prosecute police now?Cops are on trial in two high-profile cases
The jury began deliberating Tuesday afternoon after attorneys delivered their closing arguments.
Prosecutors reminded jurors Tuesday that McClain, a massage therapist, was simply walking home from a store on Aug. 24, 2019, when he was stopped by police and violently restrained. McClain was not armed or accused of committing a crime, but a 911 caller had reported a man who seemed “sketchy.”
Roedema, Rosenblatt, and fellow officer Nathan Woodyard quickly pinned McClain to the ground and placed him in a since-banned carotid artery chokehold before paramedics Jeremy Cooper and Peter Cichuniec arrived and McClain was injected with the powerful sedative ketamine. He died days later. The city later agreed to pay $15 million to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit brought by his parents.
Prosecutor Duane Lyons said in his closing argument the officers failed to de-escalate the confrontation and ignored McClain’s pleas, Colorado Public Radio reported.
"This is not just a tragedy, this is a crime," he said.
An attorney for Rosenblatt, who was fired in 2020 for his response to a photo of three other offices reenacting the chokehold at a memorial to McClain, blamed McClain's death on the ketamine administered by the paramedics. Harvey Steinberg added in his closing argument that "Rosenblatt wasn’t even nearby when all that takes place.”
"If you're fair and you subtract emotion out of this, how can you not say not guilty? That has to be the final chapter of this ugly, ugly, ugly story," Steinberg concluded, according to CPR.
An amended autopsy report released last year determined McClain died because of "complications of ketamine administration following forcible restraint" and lists his manner of death as "undetermined." Over the course of two weeks, prosecutors played video of the struggle and witnesses testified that though the ketamine killed McClain, he likely inhaled vomit into his lungs while he was being restrained, which made it harder to breathe, and his condition deteriorated before he was given the sedative.
Roedema's attorney, Donald Sisson, told jurors the officers had to react quickly after Roedema said McClain had grabbed another officer’s gun and had repeatedly told McClain to stop fighting. The defense attorneys closed their case on Oct. 6 without calling any witnesses.
The trial of Woodyard, who was the first to stop McClain and has been suspended, starts on Friday. Cooper and Cichuniec, who are also suspended, are scheduled to stand trial in November.

Online hate has surged in the days since Hamas launched brutal terrorist attacks against Israel, and social media companies are once again under fire for failing to quell the chaos. Meanwhile, swastikas are on display in New York and California, and hate speech invades Bay Area city council meetings.
It’s the week in extremism.
Hateful and extremist speech on social media platforms has surged in the days since Hamas launched its brutal terrorist attacks on Israel on Saturday, USA TODAY reported Wednesday. In response, civil rights organizations are calling on tech companies to get much better at enforcing their terms of service and quelling hateful content. 
The conflict in Gaza has brought out American anti-Semites. In addition to the online hate, there have been at least two incidents of people displaying swastika flags in the last week, at either end of the country.
Several California cities have had to pause or cancel remote public comment sessions in recent days and weeks after meetings were hijacked by trolls shouting racist or anti-Semitic slurs. 
That’s how long Professor Brian Levin led Cal State San Bernardino’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism before his retirement this week. 
Levin is one of the foremost experts on hate and extremism in the country, if not the world. CSUSB’s hate crime reports are a bellwether used by academics and reporters alike. He will be missed!
Fresh off attending the premiere of her "Eras Tour" movie in Los Angeles on Wednesday, Taylor Swift is off to Kansas City for another one of her passions: watching Kansas City Chiefs football games.
Swift was spotted Thursday arriving at the Chiefs' game against the Denver Broncos. The singer wore a black dress, paired with a red varsity jacket.
TMZ reported earlier Thursday that Swift was expected to be in attendance to watch Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and his teammates.
Ahead of her game day arrival, Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas welcomed Swift back to the city in a social media post Thursday morning.
Swift started out the game in high spirts. The singer was seen chatting with Kelce's mother, Donna, as well as making a kissy face for the camera for a photo with a young spectator.
The "Karma" songstress also linked up with another star athlete's plus-one for some game-time celebration. Swift stood next to Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany Mahomes, and the peppy duo excitedly cheered during the match.
Swift and Kelce caused quite a stir with their first public appearance together on Sept. 24, when Kelce played against the Chicago Bears. The "Lavender Haze" singer sat in a suite with Donna Kelce and cheered him on to a 41-10 victory.

The game was the most-watched matchup of the week, drawing 24.3 million viewers and ranking first among women ages 12 to 49.
"Shout-out to Taylor for pulling up. That was pretty ballsy," Kelce said on the Sept. 29 episode of the "New Heights With Jason and Travis Kelce" podcast, adding that everyone spoke of Swift in a "great light." "And on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course. We script it all, ladies and gentlemen. It was just impressive. … It was definitely a game I’ll remember, that’s for sure."

Swift turned the Chiefs' Oct. 1 game against the New York Jets into a star-studded affair when she brought a full entourage to the Big Apple event. The popstar stood next to actress Blake Lively throughout the NFL match, with both of them cheering throughout the game.
Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds also attended with his "Deadpool 3" co-star and fellow Marvel actor Hugh Jackman. Meanwhile, "Game of Thrones" star Sophie Turner was spotted in the booth and later walking out with the Grammy-winning singer at the end of the game.
Kelce sustained an ankle injury in the Chiefs' victory over the Minnesota Vikings last week, but returned to the game and caught the eventual game-winning touchdown pass from Mahomes.
Kelce's status heading into Thursday night's game against the Broncos was uncertain after he was listed as questionable on the team's official injury report. However, the player was placed in the game's starting lineup after having attended pregame warmups.
Songwriter, icon, mogul?Taylor Swift's 'Eras' Tour movie latest economic boon for star
PHILADELPHIA – Another juggernaut got dismissed here Thursday night, the 104-win Atlanta Braves once again meeting their end at Citizens Bank Park. The 100-win Los Angeles Dodgers are home, the 101-win Baltimore Orioles not yet ready for prime time, and any notion of “top seeds” still alive in this made-for-TV tournament masquerading as the baseball playoffs is pretty much dead.
The Philadelphia Phillies play on, a concept the man who laid out more than $1 billion in salary to produce a club that’s equal parts talented, tough and together tries not to overanalyze.
“I think luck has to be a factor in life,” John Middleton, a man worth an estimated $3.7 billion and assembler of this baseball bacchanalia in South Philly, was saying in the wee hours of Friday morning, streams of champagne and Anheuser-Busch products trickling by him.
“And if anybody who’s successful doesn’t acknowledge that luck has played a part in their success, I think they’re just not paying attention to reality.”
Reality is suddenly this for Middleton and the club he owns: The Phillies are advancing to the National League Championship Series for the second consecutive year, will be heavily favored to defeat the Arizona Diamondbacks and claim back-to-back NL pennants, and somehow have turned a pair of unsettling baseball trends on their ear.
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
And much of it almost certainly wasn’t luck.
Spending big bucks on talent doesn’t work out? (As the Mets, Padres and Yankees discovered that this year).
Since 2019, Middleton has committed $1.04 billion to Bryce Harper, J.T. Realmuto, Zack Wheeler, Kyle Schwarber, Nick Castellanos and Trea Turner. All took their “welcome to Philly” lumps – and have come out the better for it.
Superstars don’t correlate with playoff success?
Well, just ask the Braves how that’s working out in Philly.
Thursday night in NLDS Game 4, the Phillies sent the NL’s likely Cy Young Award winner, Spencer Strider, and MVP, Ronald Acuña Jr., home for the winter behind the brilliance of their own, well-heeled stalwarts.
In their series-ending 3-1 victory, Castellanos, signed to a $100 million deal in March 2022, hit a pair of home runs for the second consecutive night – the first person in playoff history to pull that off – including a game-tying shot that eerily resembled his Game 3 equalizer.
Turner, the final piece of the puzzle, a $300 million shortstop that GM Dave Dombrowski, Middleton and Harper just had to have, had a perfect night: Two singles, a double, a go-ahead home run in the fifth.
As for Harper?
Middleton planted his flag with the then 26-year-old, signing him to a $330 million contract that preceded all the rest. It took four years, but what Harper’s done to Atlanta the past two postseasons almost defies belief:
Fourteen hits in 29 at-bats, five home runs – two in a stunning Game 3 revenge game – and 10 RBI.
Strangely enough, Middleton just kept coming with his checkbook – all the while adding players seemingly as relentless as his spending.
Adding Castellanos to the mix was poignant, in some ways. It reunited the longtime Detroit Tiger with Dombrowski, the GM who drafted him in Detroit, along with former Team USA teammate Harper, roomies in Venezuela as teens, Brave-killers in Philly as adults.
They shared a moment Thursday night, after Castellanos tied the game with a booming shot off Strider and later ended his night with a 112-mph rocket, the hardest-hit ball in his career.
“I said to Casty, that’s why you’re here,” Harper said in the postgame clubhouse. “That’s why I wanted you here. Because of those big moments. That’s what we were doing when we were 16, 17 years old playing in big tournaments.”
Says Castellanos: “I remember him saying like, hey, we are the next A-Rod and Jeter combo. And obviously we're not in their category yet. Derek has five championships, but it's cool.”
They’re working on it.
The Phillies will roll out Wheeler and Aaron Nola in NLCS Games 1 and 2 and will welcome the Diamondbacks to a ballpark where they’re now 26-11 in the postseason – 10-2 in this two-year run.
The Braves, the Padres, the Marlins – they’ve all discovered in the past two years how hard it is when Citizens Bank is in full throat, as it was with 45,831 on hand for Game 4. It makes sense: By the time a club acclimates to this atmosphere, the series is over.
After all, it took all the Philly stars time.
Castellanos acknowledged that year one last year moved too quickly. Harper even had a rough couple months way back in 2019. And Turner famously played so below his standards in this, his first season in Philly, that the notoriously angry masses decided to turn tail and give him a midseason standing ovation.
Just to get his head right.
It worked: Turner finished the year strongly and perhaps reinforced his belief that failure is nothing to fear.
The NLDS was a nice microcosm: Turner made two errors in a crushing Game 2 loss, and Harper finished it with a baserunning misadventure that created plenty of talk the past three days.
Harper and Turner’s response in Games 3 and 4? Nine hits in 15 at-bats, four homers, potential sainthood in Pennsylvania.
“You gotta move on. And I think we've been really good at that,” says Turner. “We have the right clubhouse for that. And you're not going to be perfect throughout the season. You're not going to be perfect in the postseason.
“It's being able to move on and pick each other up. So we got a good group, man. I think that's the only way to put it is someone messes up, so what. We can fix it. We can overcome it. And I think that belief is true. I don't think we're faking it.”
Again, Middleton believes there’s nothing coincidental about that. He believes he and Dombrowski are sterling judges of character, and the recent evidence is hard to dispute.
“Ultimately, when we handed Harper $330 million guaranteed, he was going to respond,” Middleton said of his bell cow. “Bryce looked at that contract and said, I need to live up to this. I need to earn this. As opposed to, I’ve earned it, now I can coast. I’ve got it made.
“And that’s what I think has helped us: Every time we look to sign these guys we ask – what is their character? How are they going to fit in? We make a lot of effort to talk to players, talk to coaches, to make sure they’re going to fit in here.”
As for the early struggles? Middleton is quick to credit the fans for providing both accountability and full-throated support when his stars struggle – along with internal support in the clubhouse.
“Let’s give the fans some credit for that,” Middleton says of Castellanos’ and Turner’s trial periods. “The passion of the Philadelphia fans is unmatched. And when you channel passion positively, it’s an extraordinary motivating force.
“Passion, when directed negatively, is a really corrosive force. These guys stood up and supported Nick, supported Trea, supported Bryce.”
If there’s a unifying theme for both smaller-market teams and analytically inclined big-budget clubs like the Dodgers, it’s that the aim is to provide your team a chance to win in as many years as possible. The Phillies’ approach feels much more scorched earth – see a need, sign a guy, fill the hole.
At some point, the spigot will be turned down, if not totally off. The Phillies are getting close to their ideal, a gritty but wildly talented club that’s both entertaining and successful.
Monday, they’ll take aim at the Diamondbacks, and perhaps will get a revenge date with the Houston Astros in the World Series.
If they fall short, it certainly won’t be for lack of effort – from the owner’s suite to the front office, from the grandstands to the clubhouse, all the factors combining to shoo away the bad playoff mojo that’s befallen so many titans of the game this autumn.
“Winning teams find ways to win,” says Harper, shirtless and clad in socks amid the Phillies’ booming celebratory playlist.
“At all costs.”
From getting stuck in traffic and the extra effort put into getting dressed, many employees would much rather clock in from home. However, a recent survey found that one of the biggest reasons could simply be how costly it is to make money.
Owl Lab's 2023 "State of Work" report found 66% of U.S. employees who returned to the office to work five days a week or full time, spend an average of $51 every workday.
“There’s no question” about whether working in-person is “wildly more expensive” today than it was before the pandemic, the videoconferencing company's CEO Frank Weishaupt told CNBC.
How long does retirement last?Most American men don't seem to know
Working in the office costs pet owners an extra $20 a day on average, the report states.
The report also states that 49% of workers feel it's easier to maintain a work life balance with a remote job while 31% believe it's easier with a hybrid and only 20% at the office.
The survey shares information on what work tasks are easier to complete during a remote shift, what perks exist at the office and which work models managers feel their teams better thrive in.
The report found that employees working at the office pay about $51 a day on the following expenses:
Your connection with your coworkers can often make or break a job.
Owl Labs found that 46% of employees find it easier to build colleague relationships when working from home. 23% found doing so harder with a remote job while 26% said it made no difference whether they saw their fellow staff in-person or not.

Between August and September 2022, around 27% of the U.S. workforce worked remotely at least part-time, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Multiple academic servers suggested that actually about half of Americans worked remotely at least part-time, the MIT Sloan School of Management reported in June.
Marvin Dulaney can’t always field enough staff on Saturdays to serve the growing crowds visiting the African American Museum of Dallas.
The number of visitors has nearly doubled in recent years and Dulaney expects it will continue to climb as more states try to limit some teachings of Black history and ban more books.
“When you say to people, ‘You can’t read these books or you can’t read this information.’ What are they going to do?’’ said Dulaney, the museum’s deputy director. “They're going to defy you and read those books and also go learn that information that you don't want them to know.’’
Dulaney and others who head museums that focus on the Black experience in the United States expect more people will turn to their institutions to learn more in the wake of efforts to restrict Black history teachings in public schools. Some say they are already seeing more visitors, while others point to anecdotal evidence that interest is on the rise.
“Across the country, we're seeing this wave of people whose blinders have been on or their history lessons have been kind of watered down for them and they want the true story so they want to come into our museums,’’ said Vedet Coleman-Robinson, executive director of the Association of African American Museums.
Black museums across the country – large and small – have provided a space for people to learn about Black history. That mission is even more important now, historians said.
“All this talk about history is making folks more curious about history,’’ said Tonya Matthews, president and chief executive officer of the new International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina.
At the African American Museum in Dallas, the 100-person seat auditorium is often packed for Thursday night panels. In the past, only 25 visitors would be in the space.
Dulaney said initial eagerness to get out after COVID was the driving force behind the jump, but he believes renewed interest in Black history has been a major factor in surging attendance. None of the other museums in the city focus on the Black experience, he said.
“We always bragged that we're not only the best game, but the only game in town in terms of being able to learn about Black history,’’ said Dulaney, also president of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, which held a panel on teaching Black history at its conference in Florida this summer.
Dulaney also attributes the increase in visitors to efforts to push back against a campaign by mostly conservative lawmakers to restrict teachings of Black history in public schools in some states, including Alabama, Florida and Texas. He said movements to ban some books mostly by Black authors have also spurred interest.
In response to growing interest, the museum plans to restart a community African American history course this month.
Educators are looking to supplement history lessons and find ways for students to access more history, including through museums, said Neil A. Barclay, president and CEO of the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit.
“We believe that there's an interest in not only learning about African American history, but also finding creative and innovative ways to teach that history to young people,’’ Barclay said.

Black churches in Florida buck DeSantis: 'Our churches will teach our own history.'
Historians said there has always been a debate over how much of the history of Blacks in America should be taught. That fight in part helped spur the push for more Black museums, they said.
“More folks are aware of the debate that has always been raging,’’ said Matthews of the International African American Museum.
Interest in Black museums has been growing for years so it’s not surprising that more people turn to them as the battle over Black history continues, experts said. The National Museum for African American History and Culture opened in Washington, D.C., in 2016 with much fanfare.
“That interest will always be there, regardless of whatever pushbacks there are,’’ said Lonnie Bunch, founding director of the NMAAHC and now Secretary of the Smithsonian. “You want to make sure that those museums are strong so when the pendulum swings and more and more people are coming to the subject they have good museums to explore.’’
Plans for the International African American Museum had been in the works for years. The museum, which opened in June and has had 50,000 visitors, is in Charleston, once one of the busiest slave ports in the country.
Matthews called the museum and others “free choice learning institutions.’’
Part of the challenge, she said, is to sustain interest without another tragedy fueling support.
The museum broke ground in 2019, four years after a white gunman killed nine Black churchgoers at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston. Construction of the museum was underway during the 2020 protests over the murder of George Floyd in Minnesota. Those tragedies sparked interest in people wanting to learn more about the history of Blacks in America, Matthews said. It also increased support for the museum.
It took a “tragedy to get us over the finish line,’’ she said. “No one wishes that on anyone.’’
Black museums often experience a spike in visitation when there’s civil unrest or a social justice movement, said Coleman-Robinson. She likened the restrictions on teaching Black history and book bans to social injustice.
“People come to our museums because our museums are sanctuaries,’’ Coleman-Robinson said, adding that some also serve as learning centers. “We also see a spike because people are like, ‘Okay, well, we got to know where we came from in order to know where we're going.’ ”
Michael Morris, director of the Museum of Mississippi History and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, said he took notice one recent Saturday when he saw a group of about 20 Black boys visiting from New Orleans. It didn’t appear to be a traditional school field trip. It was a weekend. The group spent hours exploring the museum.
“They wanted to make sure that they got the real history,’’ said Morris.
Morris said he doesn’t know if there’s more interest in visiting the museum, which is still recovering after closing four months during the COVID pandemic. But he said there’s been interest in the mission of the museum, which features exhibits about the brutality of Jim Crow and slavery and the fight by civil rights activists for equality for Black citizens. More than 600,000 people have visited the museum since it opened six years ago.
Morris said he doesn’t feel pressure to not tell the “unvarnished truth.”
With the loss of civil rights legends such as Bob Moses in 2021 and Hollis Watkins, a Mississippi native, last month, Morris said preserving Black history is more important than ever.
“This museum was built with the exact purpose of making sure that their stores continue to be told,’’ he said. “It’s so important that we get many school students in here and learning about these stories, learning about these ordinary people that changed the nation, that changed Mississippi.’’
Some other groups that focus on sharing Black history have also seen interest grow.
On one recent Saturday, the Gullah Heritage Trail Tours bus wheeled its way around Hilton Head stopping at sites where visitors could learn more about the island’s Gullah Geechee community. The community is home to descendants of enslaved Africans who because of their isolation on the island was able to hold onto some African customs and create a unique and rich culture.
In the last five years more Black customers have joined the tours, said Irvin Campbell, one of the founding partners of the 27-year-old company. Unlike in the past, most customers in recent months have been Black.
“I don’t know if we’re getting more interested in our culture or what,’’ Campbell said. “The push is on (promoting) Black culture in this area.’’
In 2006, Congress designated the region as the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, which aims to preserve the culture along coastal Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
Campbell said he’s expecting more Black customers and plans to train more guides and drivers.
“It would do wonders for our community…to know more about who we are and what we’re about,” he said.
The first school resource officer came into existence in the late 1950s under the guise that having a police officer in the school would "improve" the relationship between youth and law enforcement – a novel claim that helped SRO programs multiply. It's estimated that 20% of schools have an officer.
Yet, despite this original claim that relationships with the youth would improve, there has not been any conclusive evidence that an officer presence improves youth relationships with law enforcement. In fact, the research is quite mixed. 
Uh oh, it's Friday the 13th. We’ve been told it's a very unlucky day.
So why is it so scary for us?
One explanation is that Friday and the number 13 both have violent historical connections to Christianity.
It was on a Friday that Jesus was crucified, and ever since, the day has been associated with a "general ill omen," Michael Bailey, a history professor at Iowa State University who specializes in the origins of superstitions, tells USA TODAY Network.
In the Middle Ages, for instance, weddings were not held on Fridays; likewise, it was not a day someone would set out on a journey, Bailey says.
Friday was also unlucky in medieval times because it was "hangman's day," says Stuart Vyse, a psychology professor at Connecticut College, in an interview with USA TODAY Network.
Thankfully, Friday the 13th doesn’t happen all too often. The majority of years, like 2023, we have two Friday the 13ths, but occasionally there is just one in a month. Three of the unfortunate days occur in particularly unlucky years, such as 2026.

You may not be alone in your fear. You could be suffering from triskaidekaphobia – the fear of the number 13.
According to Vyse, the number 13 was associated with bad luck since it’s believed that Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, was the 13th person to attend the Last Supper.
There are no references to Friday the 13th until the 19th century, according to Bailey and Vyse, so it's unclear precisely when Friday and the number 13 started to be associated.
If number 13 doesn't frighten you unless it's on Friday, you may be more at risk of a condition frequently referred to as paraskevidekatriaphobia, which is the fear of Friday the 13th itself.
According to a recent survey by YouGov.com, Americans who are 25 to 34 years old may be the most anxious about the spooky date. Of that age group, nearly a quarter (23%) stated they were very superstitious.
If Friday the 13th is an unlucky day for you, you might want to decrease your chances of getting bad luck, by just lying in bed all day and avoid everything.
Good luck!
