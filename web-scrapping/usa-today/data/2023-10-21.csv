When Angel Amankwaah traveled from Denver to North Carolina Central University for incoming student orientation this summer, she decided she had made the right choice. 
She had fun learning the chants that fans perform at football games. But she also saw that “there are students who look like me, and professors who look like me” at the historically Black university, said Amankwaah, 18, who is Black. “I knew that I was in a safe space.”
This has in the past two years become an important consideration for college-bound students from all backgrounds and beliefs. With so much attention focused on these issues, USA TODAY and The Hechinger Report present the first-of-its-kind College Welcome Guide showing state laws and institutional policies that affect college and university students, from bans on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and “critical race theory” to rules about guns on campus and whether student IDs are accepted as proof of residency for voting purposes.
The digital tables also list, for every four-year institution in the country, such things as racial and gender diversity among students and faculty, the number of student veterans enrolled, the incidence of on-campus race-motivated hate crimes, free-speech rankings and if the university or college serves many students from rural places.
Test our new College Welcome Guide:These tools offer a new lens on campus life.
Students have long picked schools based on their academic reputations and social life. But with campuses in the crosshairs of the culture wars, many students are now also taking stock of attacks on diversity, course content and speech and speakers from both ends of the political spectrum. They’re monitoring hate crimes, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, state abortion laws and whether students like them ‒ Black, rural, military veterans, LGBTQ+ or from other backgrounds ‒ are represented and supported on campus.
“There’s no question that what’s happening at the state level is directly affecting these students,” said Alyse Levine, founder and CEO of Premium Prep, a private college admissions consulting firm in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. When they look at colleges in various states now, she said, “There are students who are asking, ‘Am I really wanted here?’”
For some students on both sides of the political divide, the answer is no. In the chaotic new world of American colleges and universities, many say they feel unwelcome at certain schools, while others are prepared to shut down speakers and report faculty with whose opinions they disagree.
It’s too early to know how much this trend will affect where and whether prospective students end up going to college since publicly available enrollment data lags real time. But there are early clues that it’s having a significant impact.
One in 4 prospective students has already ruled out a college or university for consideration because of the political climate in its state, according to a survey by the higher education consulting firm Art & Science Group.
Among students who describe themselves as liberal, the most common reason to rule out colleges and universities in a particular state, that survey found, is because it’s “too Republican” or has what they consider lax gun regulations, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, restrictive abortion laws and a lack of concern about racism. Students who describe themselves as conservative are rejecting states they believe to be “too Democrat” and that have liberal abortion and gay rights laws.
Sixty percent of prospective students of all backgrounds say new state restrictions on abortion would at least somewhat influence where they choose to go to college, a separate poll by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation found. Of these, 8 in 10 say they would prefer to go to a state with greater access to reproductive health services. (Lumina is among the funders of The Hechinger Report, which produced this story.)
“We have many young women who will not look at certain states,” said Levine. One of her own clients backed out of going to a university in St. Louis after Missouri banned almost all abortions following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, she said.
Institutions in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Texas are the most likely to be knocked off the lists of liberal students, according to the Art & Science Group survey. They’re generally most likely to steer clear of the South and Midwest, while conservative students avoid California and New York.
One in 8 high school students in Florida say they won’t go to a public university in their own state because of its education policies, a separate poll, by the college ranking and information website Intelligent.com, found.
With 494 anti-LGBTQ+ laws proposed or adopted this year, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, prospective students who are LGBTQ+ and have experienced significant harassment because of it are nearly twice as likely to say they don't plan to go to college at all compared with students who experienced lower levels of harassment, according to a survey by GLSEN, formerly the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.
“You are attacking kids who are already vulnerable,” said Javier Gomez, an LGBTQ+ student in his first year at Miami Dade College. “And it’s not just queer students. So many young people are fed up.”
It’s not yet evident whether the new laws are affecting where LGBTQ+ young people are choosing to go to college, said Casey Pick, director of law and policy at The Trevor Project, which supports LGBTQ+ young people in crisis. But LGBTQ+ adults are moving away from states passing anti-LGBTQ+ laws, she said. And “if adult employees are taking this into account when they decide where they want to live, you can bet that college students are making the same decisions.”
Since DeSantis takeover,surge in dropouts at New College of Florida
Meanwhile, in an era of pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion policies in many states, and against affirmative action in college admissions nationwide, Amankwaah is one of a growing number of Black students choosing what they see as the relative security of an HBCU. Enrollment at HBCUs increased by around 3% in 2021, the last year for which the figure is available, while the number of students at other universities and colleges fell. 
“The real attack here is on the feeling of belonging,” said Jeremy Young, who directs the Freedom to Learn program at PEN America, which tracks laws that restrict college and university diversity efforts and teaching about race. “What it really does is hoist a flag to say to the most marginalized students, ‘We don’t want you here.’” 
More than 40% of university and college administrators say the Supreme Court ruling curbing the use of affirmative action in admissions will affect diversity on their campuses, a Princeton Review poll found as the school year was beginning.
College students of all races and political persuasions report feeling uncomfortable on campuses that have become political battlegrounds. Those on the left are bristling at new laws blocking programs in diversity, equity and inclusion and the teaching of certain perspectives about race; on the right, at conservative speakers being shouted down or canceled, unpopular comments being called out in class and what they see as an embrace of values different from what they learned at home.
More than 1 in 10 students at four-year universities now say they feel as if they downright don’t belong on their campus, and another 2 in 10 neither agree nor strongly agree that they belong, another Lumina and Gallup survey found. It found that those who answer in these ways are more likely to frequently experience stress and more likely to drop out.
Military veterans who use their GI Bill benefits to return to school say one of their most significant barriers is a feeling that they won’t be welcome, a survey by the D’Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University found. Nearly two-thirds say that faculty and administrators don’t understand the challenges they face, and 70% say the same thing about their non-veteran classmates. 
Colleges should be “safe and affirming spaces,” said Pick, of the Trevor Project ‒ not places of isolation and alienation.
Yet a significant number of students say they don’t feel comfortable sharing their views in class, according to another survey, conducted by College Pulse for the right-leaning Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at North Dakota State University. Of those, 72% say they worry their opinions would be considered unacceptable by classmates and 45%, by their professors. Conservative students are less likely than their liberal classmates to believe that all points of view are welcome and less willing to share theirs. 
“Is that really an intellectually diverse environment?” asked Sean Stevens, director of polling and analytics at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, which has launched a campus free-speech ranking based on students’ perceptions of comfort expressing ideas, tolerance for speakers and other measures. 
“Anecdotally and from personal experience, there’s certainly a pocket of students who are weighing these factors in terms of where to go to college,” Stevens said.
Eighty-one percent of liberal students and 53% of conservative ones say they support reporting faculty who make comments that they find offensive, the same survey found. It used sample comments such as, “There is no evidence of anti-Black bias in police shootings,” “Requiring vaccination for COVID is an assault on individual freedom” and “Biological sex is a scientific fact.”
A professor at Texas A&M University became the subject of an investigation when a student accused her of criticizing the state’s lieutenant governor during a lecture, though she was ultimately exonerated. An anthropology lecturer at the University of Chicago who taught an undergraduate course called “The Problem of Whiteness” said she was deluged with hateful messages when a conservative student posted her photo and email address on social media.
More than half of all freshmen say that colleges have the right to ban extreme speakers, according to an annual survey by an institute at the University of California, Los Angeles; the College Pulse poll says that sentiment is held by twice the proportion of liberal students as conservative ones.
A group of Stanford students in March disrupted an on-campus speech by a federal judge whose judicial record they said was anti-LGBTQ+. When he asked for an administrator to intervene, an associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion confronted him and asked: “Is it worth the pain that this causes and the division that this causes?” The associate dean was put on leave and later resigned. 
“Today it is a sad fact that the greatest threat to free speech comes from within the academy,” pronounced the right-leaning American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which is pushing colleges to sign on to its Campus Freedom Initiative that encourages teaching students about free expression during freshman orientation and disciplining people who disrupt speakers or events, among other measures.
“I have to imagine that universities that have a bad track record on freedom of expression or academic freedom, that it will affect their reputations,” said Steven Maguire, the organization’s campus freedom fellow. “I do hear people saying things like, ‘I’m worried about what kind of a college or university I can send my kids to and whether they’ll be free to be themselves and to express themselves.’”
Some colleges are now actively recruiting students on the basis of these kinds of concerns. Colorado College in September created a program to ease the process for students who want to transfer away from institutions in states that have banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; Hampshire College in Massachusetts has offered admission to any student from New College in Florida, subject of what critics have described as a conservative takeover. Thirty-five have so far accepted the invitation.
Though many conservative critics of colleges and universities say faculty are indoctrinating students with liberal opinions, incoming freshmen tend to hold left-leaning views before they ever set foot in a classroom, according to that UCLA survey.
Fewer than 1 in 5 consider themselves conservative. Three-quarters say abortion should be legal and favor stricter gun control laws, 68% say wealthy people should pay more taxes than they do now and 86% that climate change should be a federal priority and that there should be a clear path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
Prospective students say they are watching as new laws are passed and controversies erupt on campuses and actively looking into not just the quality of food and available majors at the colleges they might attend, but state politics.
“Once I decided I was going to North Carolina Central, I looked up whether North Carolina was a red state or a blue state,” Amankwaah said. (North Carolina has a Democrat as governor but Republicans control both chambers of the legislature and hold a veto-proof supermajority in the state Senate. 
Florida’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws prompted Javier Gomez to leave his native state and move to New York to go to fashion school. But then he came back, transferring to Miami Dade.
“People ask me, ‘Why the hell are you back in Florida?’” said Gomez. “The reason I came back was that there was this innate calling in me that you have to stick around and fight for the queer and trans kids here. It’s overwhelming at times. It can be very mentally depleting. But I wanted to stay and continue the fight and build community against hatred.”

Thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed and Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate from the northern Gaza Strip ahead of Israel's impending ground invasion, leading to a humanitarian crisis that has brought protests from the United Nations and around the world.
The U.N. said about 1 million Gaza residents have been displaced in just a week, about half of them finding refuge in U.N. schools and other facilities where water supplies are diminishing. The war has claimed more than 4,000 lives since Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack Oct. 7.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization pleaded with Israel on Sunday to immediately reverse evacuation orders for hospitals in northern Gaza, saying the deadlines are impossible to meet and risk additional loss of life. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that attacks on health care facilities are already causing deaths and injuries. 
"The health situation in north Gaza is dire," Tedros wrote on social media. "Evacuation orders by Israel to hospitals are practically impossible to implement and are a death sentence for the sick and injured."
Here are several organizations that are providing aid to people caught in the conflict.
How to cope:The videos out of Israel, Gaza are graphic, but some can't look away
The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) is a coalition of more than 170 nongovernmental organizations that includes tens of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis who share the goal of building peace between the two communities.
"Our members are speaking loudly and clearly about the values that unite our community: Opposition to this horrific violence, and a commitment to Israeli/Palestinian partnership on the path to ending it, and achieving peace and equality," the agency said in a statement.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is a humanitarian organization that aims to protect and aid victims of conflicts. The ICRC has been in Israel and the occupied territories since 1967. The organization is asking for donations to improve access to essential services like water and to support livelihood projects.
Doctors Without Borders is a nongovernmental organization that describes itself as an "independent, impartial and neutral" charity that provides humanitarian aid to people affected by conflict, disease outbreaks and natural and human-made disasters.
The agency is seeking donations to continue to provide medical care in the area. The agency has reported overcrowding in hospitals, a lack of medical supplies, and dangerous working conditions as it tries to support the thousands injured by the fighting.
UNRWA has designated shelters to host the estimated 127,000 people displaced in Gaza. The agency is seeking donations to support its work.
The Jewish Agency for Israel North American Council, an American charity organization, is accepting donations to help victims of terrorism.
Save the Children issued an emergency alert in response to the conflict, noting that escalating violence has left 1.2 million children in need of humanitarian aid. The agency is accepting donations.
National and international organizations that aid victims in the conflict include the Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF), which works to provide lifesaving medical relief and humanitarian aid.
Founded by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, in partnership with Emory University, The Carter Center is a humanitarian aid organization that has been promoting peace and a viable two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades.
After Israel declared war, The Carter Center released a statement condemning the targeting of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and called for international action to end the violence.

JERUSALEM − They don't agree on a lot of things. They agree on this: What they have seen and had to do, no one should have to see or do.
Two weeks into the conflict that began when Hamas massacred civilians in rural communities and at a music festival on Israel's border with the Gaza Strip, Israelis and Palestinians have been collecting, weeping over and burying their dead with as much dignity as they can in trying, unpredictable and dangerous circumstances.
In Israel, where more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers have died and where all Jews are by religious tenet supposed to be buried immediately after death − a few days at most − this has involved emergency responders going to great lengths to recover bodies they have discovered in scenes of unspeakable horror, sometimes in places where fighting is still taking place.
In Gaza, where at least 3,500 Palestinians have been killed and large parts of the territory controlled by Hamas are in ruins as a result of Israel's bombing campaign, this has meant families resorting to makeshift graveyards dug in empty lots and authorities storing bodies in ice cream freezers as morgues fill up, doctors and witnesses say.
'I won't condemn Hamas':Some Palestinians find it hard to denounce attacks on Israel
"I'm not eating. I'm not sleeping," said Israeli search and rescue volunteer Yossi Landau, 55, as he struggled not to weep Wednesday recounting some of what he witnessed in villages in southern Israel after the nation's deadliest attack ever.
Meanwhile, in Gaza, photographer Ali Jadallah said that "we have reached a catastrophic situation" in which Israel's bombs are killing scores of Palestinian families − sometimes entombing them in their collapsed homes, sometimes leaving their mutilated bodies scattered among the ruins.
On both sides of the Israel-Gaza border, faith traditions define the rules of burial. For Jews, who believe the dead must be watched until they are buried and that every part of a body must be buried, the idea of unguarded remains is an almost unthinkable lapse. Within the Muslim tradition, the body is wrapped in a shroud and the head is positioned to face Mecca with the eyes and mouth closed.
Jadallah said he has lost nine family members to Israeli airstrikes, according to updates he has been posting on his Instagram account. He filmed himself this week as he was driving in his car. Across the back seat lay the body of his father, killed in one of those Israeli strikes.

"We have no funeral cars, no ambulances," he said.
"I'm taking him alone (to bury him). I know people can't attend the funeral. No one can. But please pray for him. He was a decent and beloved man."
In Israel, Landau works for ZAKA, a volunteer organization whose members are almost all ultra-Orthodox Jews. Its mission is to collect the remains of the dead, including their blood if they can, so they can be buried in accordance with Jewish religious law.
For the past three decades, Landau has deployed for ZAKA all over the world. He was in New York after the 9/11 attacks. He has responded to natural disasters in India. He has rushed many times to the scene of suicide bombings.
He helped recover the dead in Surfside, Florida, when a 12-story condominium building collapsed early in the morning of June 24, 2021, killing 98 people.
Israel-Hamas war:She spent her life advocating for Palestinian rights. Then Hamas came
Yet Landau said that what he encountered in several of the kibbutzim that dot the front lines where Israeli civilians and soldiers were killed by Hamas on Oct. 7 was more than he could bear.
"I broke. I blanked out," he said.
Landau said that in one home, in Kibbutz Be'eri, he saw children as young as 6 with their hands tied behind their backs in the same room where their parents were also executed. They were missing fingers and eyes. In another home, he found a pregnant woman lying face down in a pool of blood. When Landau and other ZAKA volunteers turned the woman over, they found her belly had been "butchered open" and the unborn child connected to her had been stabbed.
"I don't know if you know − and you should never know − what it means to separate parts of a burned body," he said, referring to the charred remains of people he came across in vehicles and safe rooms in Be'eri and other kibbutzim in the days after Hamas' assault.
The killing scenes Landau described were corroborated by half a dozen other ZAKA volunteers who were present in Be'eri and elsewhere with him as part of their emergency response.
Cellphone videos, security footage, photographs from residents and accounts of witnesses who survived the initial attacks have also helped establish with some specificity the brutality of the Hamas attacks on civilians on Israel's southern border.
ZAKA volunteers are generally prohibited, as a matter of religious custom, from photographing the work they do. But Israel's military has asked them to document it as part of the process of collecting evidence and in case it is helpful in identifying remains.
A ZAKA volunteer named Nachman Dickstein, who was with Landau in Be'eri, showed USA TODAY photographs that further corroborated his grisly accounts of murdered Israelis. And last week, USA TODAY visited an Israel Defense Forces base on the outskirts of Jerusalem where a rabbinate unit of Israel's military has been working to identify the remains of people, including women, children and infants, after ZAKA volunteers delivered them there from communities in Israel's south.
Hamas attacks:How Israeli police are trying to find the gunmen
On the grounds of the base were a series of refrigerated trucks and shipping containers. Inside were dozens of filled body bags of various sizes − some of them very small.
Palestinian Muslims and Christians, like Jews, believe that the dead should be buried as quickly as possible, ideally within 24 hours.
The bereaved family typically hosts a meal and opens their home for three days for guests to visit and share their condolences. Unsweetened bitter coffee is served.
Friends and family recount the life and qualities of the loved one.
In Gaza, there is now little capacity to observe these rituals.
After Jadallah drove his father's body to a private burial site, he went straight back to work, he said in a brief interview Thursday. One of the first photos he took was of a paramedic performing CPR on a wounded man. Jadallah's Instagram feed is filled with increasingly apocalyptic images of bombed-out and smoldering homes, mosques, schools and even hospitals.
At least 16 Palestinian journalists have been killed since Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, a nongovernmental professional organization.
"Who kills babies, who kills babies − free world, where are you?" a doctor at the European Gaza Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis pleaded Thursday in a video circulated by health officials and journalists in Gaza.
He stood in front of a stretcher on which lay six precious bundles. Bloodied, bandaged and lifeless, their tiny bodies were covered in a fine gray dust from the exploded concrete and brick that killed them.
Still, while the bodies in Gaza are piling up, it's too dangerous to hold funerals, and the Palestinian enclave on the Mediterranean Sea is now running out of body bags, according to the United Nations.
Riham Al Qeeq, 40, a mother of four, said her cousin was buried in a mass grave after an explosion Tuesday at the crowded Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City.
She said she wasn't able to join in a brief ceremony at the site because she was worried about the safety of her family and had decided to flee south, close to Gaza's border with Egypt.
The increasing number of dead also means people are having to bury their loved ones in ad hoc burial sites, according to Mohammad Abu Salmiya, director-general of Al-Shifa hospital there.
Abu Salmiya spoke to USA TODAY briefly Thursday as he sought to juggle the round-the-clock needs of patients, a hospital facing critical shortages − medicine and clean drinking water among them − and a desire to keep the world informed about the scale of humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Communication into and out of Gaza is exceptionally difficult because of diminishing electricity and virtually no internet access.
Abu Salmiya said that after the Al-Ahli Hospital bombing, his medical facility, a few miles away, received "hundreds of bodies" that "were burned and mutilated and couldn’t be identified," while survivors were in critical to extremely critical condition.
Thirty people, he said, were operated on without any anesthetic.
"For those that were killed we had to make a quick decision," he said. "We had to bury them in mass graves so we don't face the spread of disease and also because they were either unidentified bodies or had no one to come and collect them."
The latest guilty pleas from two key allies in Donald Trump's high-profile Georgia election interference case put new pressure on the former president and raise questions about whether his once-loyal associates may one day flip on him.
Two attorneys, Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell, pleaded guilty to related crimes this week and agreed to testify against other defendants. They had been charged with playing separate roles in an alleged multi-pronged conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Coming after a third defendant, Scott Hall, pleaded guilty in September, their deals bolster the weapons in prosecutors' toolbox, and may pressure other defendants to flip -- a move that would raise the legal stakes for Trump.
''Once you get a couple people pleading, it starts sort of an avalanche of pleas," said Chandelle Summer, a Georgia attorney who previously worked as both a prosecutor and public defender in the state.
In addition to agreeing to testify, Chesebro, Powell, and Hall will turn over relevant documents to the state of Georgia, and are prohibited from communicating with witnesses or defendants in the case.
Norman Eisen, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2020, said information from the three former Trump associates, could bolster the government's evidence in another pending Trump trial -- federal election meddling case, which is scheduled to start in March in Washington.
"Both Powell and Chesebro were unindicted co-conspirators in the federal case, so they're central to it," Eisen said. "It is ominous for the other defendants in the state or federal cases, above all Donald Trump."
Chesebro, an election lawyer, pleaded guilty Friday in the Fulton County Superior Court to a felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. Chesebro offers an inside view of the development of the scheme to recruit fake presidential electors to vote for Trump in states that President Joe Biden won.
Chesebro created and distributed false documents in Georgia and other states for people to submit to the National Archives and Congress posing as presidential electors, according to Daysha Young, the executive district attorney in Fulton County.
"The defendant provided detailed instructions to co-conspirators in Georgia and other states for creating and distributing these false documents," she said.
Chesebro's deal gets the prosecution closer to John Eastman, who around that time appears to have been in "constant communication" with Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump, said Melissa Redmon, a former Fulton County prosecutor who directs the University of Georgia School of Law's Prosecutorial Justice Program.
Those connections will help the state paint a picture for the jury of the false elector activity being ultimately motivated by a desire to make sure Trump retained the presidency "by any means necessary," Redmon said.
Sixteen co-defendants in the Georgia case, including Trump, Eastman and Giuliani, have pleaded not guilty.
Powell, an election lawyer who spread baseless claims of voter fraud, pleaded guilty Thursday to a half-dozen misdemeanors associated with tampering with election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia.
Legal experts said Powell's agreement to provide testimony could have a weighty impact on the wider case because she had significant dealings with Trump, Giuliani, and others.
Powell can also describe how co-defendants tried to overturn the 2020 election. She and Giuliani attended a raucous meeting at the White House with Trump, where they discussed having the military seize voting machines. Trump never acted on the proposal.
Hall, a bail bondsman who served as a go-between for several of the co-defendants, pleaded guilty in September to five misdemeanors dealing with interfering with election duties.
Hall helped SullivanStrickler employees tamper with the Coffee County equipment.
Hall also made multiple calls to co-defendants in the case. For example, Hall spoke with Jeffrey Clark, a former assistant attorney general, for more than an hour Jan. 2, 2021, according to the indictment.
Clark, who pleaded not guilty, is charged with drafting a letter of false statements about Justice Department concerns with the 2020 election, to be sent to Georgia officials. Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to sign or send the letter.
Hall also spoke repeatedly with co-defendants accused of trying to intimidate election workers to change their stories about what happened with ballot counting at State Farm Arena on election night 2020.
Although the pleas open up several months on McAfee's calendar that had been reserved for Powell and Chesebro's trial, Redmon said typically in Fulton County there are several steps involving pre-trial deadlines before a trial date is set in a case, and she doesn't expect to see a trial date for Trump soon.
Summer said McAfee would have to take the schedules for Trump's other criminal trials into account, as well as his attorneys' scheduling conflicts.
"Assuming he's acquitted in the DC case, I think then they'll probably specially set a trial for sometime after that, maybe the fall of 2024," she said.
Eisen suggested McAfee might aim to hold Trump's Georgia trial sooner.
"If Chesebro and Powell could get ready for trial on an accelerated basis, surely it's not too unreasonable for Trump and possibly other defendants to prepare themselves to face a jury in Atlanta at some point in the coming months," Eisen said.
ARLINGTON, Texas — As Jose Altuve’s fly ball disappeared over the wall in left field, needing every single inch of its 382-foot flight plan to save their season, the Houston Astros turned Globe Life Field into their own party deck.
Starting pitcher Justin Verlander came out onto the dirt outside the dugout and leaped into the air, his hang time belying his 40-year-old frame. He was joined, perhaps not hyperbolically, by every player on their roster saluting their longtime and forever hero, Altuve, who authored arguably his greatest playoff chapter in a career that could fill a tome of them.
Bryan Abreu simply fumed.
As his teammates joined in a bobbing mass of joy after Altuve’s three-run home run in the top of the ninth inning erased a two-run deficit and delivered a stunning, emotionally wrought 5-4 victory over the Texas Rangers in Game 5 of this suddenly spicy American League Championship Series, Abreu gazed around the empty visitors’ clubhouse at Globe Life Field and realized he was all alone.
Minutes earlier, he’d been ejected for a fastball that struck Rangers right fielder Adolis Garcia, the umpiring crew determining his pitch was intentional, revenge for Garcia’s go-ahead three-run home run and ostentatious celebration to follow, a claim he and the Astros thought was ludicrous and that Garcia himself didn’t particularly encourage.
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
And so when Altuve crushed a changeup from Rangers closer Jose Leclerc and sent it just over the grasp of leaping left fielder Evan Carter, Abreu was perhaps the only soul from Sugar Land to Spring not overcome by joy.
“I was really mad,” says Abreu, a hugely valuable piece of the Astros’ winning formula each of the past two years. “I would love to be outside there, celebrating with my teammates. But I was in here, for no reason.
“That really pissed me off.”
Yet Abreu’s isolation only added to the emotional palette of this game, a stunning nine innings that had it all – soaring achievement and crushing failure, redemption and revenge, gratitude and grousing.
“I’m going to tell my kids about this game,” says Astros center fielder Mauricio Dubon.
“It was an incredible baseball game,” says Alex Bregman, the Astros third baseman who has played in 95 of these postseason affairs.
The stakes were massive: The Astros will go back to Houston for Sunday's Game 6 of this ALCS, needing one win to advance to a third consecutive World Series. The Rangers absorbed the ultimate gut punch, from which almost every postseason club fails to recover.
USA TODAY Sports breaks down the most compelling figures from nine innings of drama: 
The arc of the elite athlete can be fascinating: From fresh new thing, to consistent All-Star, to yesterday’s news. Only when the athlete continues achieving the absurd, commanding the spotlight, bending the game to their will, do they appear intriguing again.
This is the rarefied space Altuve occupies.
His home run Friday was the 26th playoff bomb of his career, second in major league history. Yet with playoffs ever expanding and the postseason stretching five weeks when one once sufficed, these high-water marks can seem like statistical debris
No, it is not just the numbers but the time and place and significance that tell a greater story, such as his 2019 walk-off homer off current Ranger Aroldis Chapman in Game 6 of the ALCS that sent the Astros to the World Series. That likely stood as his most significant of his 112 playoff hits.
Until Friday.
Those 2019 Astros were a near lock to eliminate the Yankees. These Astros were three outs away from their World Series defense in jeopardy.
Instead, they can spend the off day pondering how much better life is up 3-2 rather than down the same in a best-of-seven series.
“I got to say this one,” Altuve said Friday when asked to rank his greatest hits, “because it just happened and still have the emotions, the adrenaline in me.”
Recency bias? No, perhaps the magnitude only grows the more times a legend does it.
“It’s literally an honor to take the field with him every single day,” says Bregman. “I hope my 14-month-old son grows up to be the man he is.”
That was a common theme Friday, Astros players singing the praises of Altuve the person and not the player. For the past four years, he has heard a chorus of boos that ring out not because he’s a high-achieving villain on a rival team, but rather a member of the 2017 World Series-winning Astros team that concocted a daft sign-stealing scheme.
Yet it’s been six years since that scandal and four years since its revelation. The Astros are on the verge of their third pennant since then, and a shot at consecutive World Series titles. Fans aren’t obligated to grant Altuve sainthood, but they’d be wise to recognize the killer between the white lines.
Friday’s moment came with a stunning sense of inevitability.
Altuve came in on a heater: Five hits in nine at-bats since the ALCS shifted to the Rangers’ Globe Life Field, where the Astros hit extremely well. Altuve had the table set for him: Pinch-hitters Yainer Diaz and Jonathan Singleton singled and drew a walk, respectively, flipping the order to get back to you-know-who.
Altuve had a vulnerable target: Leclerc was trying to complete a five-out save, a bit out of his comfort zone even before his outing was disrupted by a 10-minute delay due to the fracas and umpires debating punishment.
“You don't use the word ‘expect,’” says Verlander, “but you anticipate something great happening.”
So when Leclerc’s change up stayed up and on the inner half of the plate, Altuve went down and got it. Rangers 4, Astros 2 became Astros 5, Rangers 4.
And Leclerc became the latest to get posterized in October.
“It’s like everything’s in slow motion for him,” says Astros closer Ryan Pressly, the winning pitcher. “ Josey’s just one of those guys where you better make quality pitches.
“Otherwise, he’s going to rock your world.”
Just one player on the Astros’ roster comes close to Altuve’s Astro tenure: Reserve first baseman Jon Singleton debuted in 2014, Altuve’s fourth year.
But Singleton’s stint has not been consecutive, his path diverted multiple times.
He came up in an era when marijuana use was considered punishable for minor leaguers, and as he failed to gain traction with the Astros, he was suspended three times for violating the weed policy.
The Astros released him in 2018, with just 357 major league at-bats under his belt. It’d be five more years before he got another one, catching on with the Milwaukee Brewers.
The Astros picked him up in June, a sparingly used bat. But he made the playoff roster and, despite having just seven at-bats since Sept. 13, had a feeling his number would be called as Game 5 unfolded.
Friday, Altuve would make history with his 466th career playoff plate appearance.
Singleton would have his first.
“You kind of get a feeling the way a baseball game starts out, the way it continues through the middle parts, coming down the line you get a feeling for what the next move is going to be before the manager has to tell anybody,” says Singleton, who watched the Astros take leads of 1-0 and 2-1 until Garcia finished Verlander with a game-turning and seemingly series-turning three-run shot.
“Honestly, it’s a lot of being psychologically ready, day in and day out. Putting in the work, staying sharp so that when my number’s called, I’m ready.”
With the Astros trailing 4-2 in the ninth, the Astros’ coaching staff, with manager Dusty Baker ejected the inning earlier, got aggressive: Diaz pinch-hit for shortstop Jeremy Peña and singled. Singleton was summoned to bat for the light-hitting Martin Maldonado.
Singleton didn’t swing the bat, even as Leclerc battled back from a three-ball count to run it full. And the man who batted .165 this year with a .267 on-base percentage, whose plate discipline was so grim with Milwaukee that the Brewers released him with a .188 OBP, beat the odds again.
He got on base.
OK, it was just a walk. But stars need table-setters and sometimes a championship team needs every man on its roster.
“Singleton’s at-bat was massive, to give Altuve the chance,” says Bregman. “Talk about two guys who hadn’t had many postseason at-bats really come through for us there
“It speaks to their character and their preparation they put in on a daily basis even if they’re not in the lineup every day.”
When Abreu and Baker were tossed in the bottom of the eighth inning, chaos reigned and the Astros were, to put it mildly, screwed. They trailed by two runs, and the Rangers had two men on base, and Houston was forced to summon its closer, not to close the game but more to provide a life raft.
Pressly would not earn his 16th career playoff save this day. It would be far more impressive than that.
With Globe Life Field buzzing like a hornet’s nest, Pressly induced a groundout that put runners on second and third. Then, he punched out Josh Jung and Nathaniel Lowe – who homered earlier – to end the threat.
The score would stay 4-2.
“It’s kind of hard to explain, but the louder the crowd gets, for me, it’s almost like white noise,” says Pressly. “It doesn’t really bother me that much. I just want to go out and make quality pitches – pick up my teammate.”
Indeed, Abreu’s walk and hit-by-pitch that started the insanity would not hurt the Astros. But Pressly’s job was just beginning.
After Altuve’s homer, the Rangers immediately punched back, with singles from Mitch Garver and Jonah Heim putting the tying and winning runs on in the ninth. It flipped the Rangers’ lineup, too, putting them in position to replicate Altuve’s feat.
Pressly didn’t let that happen.
Marcus Semien hit a lineout to reserve shortstop Grae Kessinger. Corey Seager flew out to Dubon in deep center field. And Carter, the celebrated rookie, struck out swinging.
Game over.
“I joke around with him, telling him, I want his job” says Dubon. “But in situations like this, no, heck no, I don’t want that job.”
This game wouldn’t be complete without an ignominious figure or two. Leclerc, sure, but he was taken far out of his comfort zone.
Garcia’s role in all this is minimal: He was simply hit by a pitch. Yet for fans of a redemptive narrative, he certainly played the heel.
Garcia immediately got in catcher Maldonado’s face, assuming the pitch was retaliation – perhaps for Garcia’s emphatic home-run celebration, or extending from a beef between the two teams in July.
Chaos ensued.
The benches cleared. Players streamed from the dugout and clubhouse. And umpires ejected Abreu, Garcia and Baker.
Nobody was pleased with that.
“It didn't make any sense to me,” says Baker, echoing the grumblings in the Astros clubhouse that Abreu might have malicious intent in a crucial playoff game. “And I haven't been that mad in a long time.
“And I don't usually get mad about nothing. So I'm just glad that we won the game.”
Crew chief James Hoye explained to a pool reporter that the six-man umpiring crew deemed Abreu’s pitch intentional. They considered Garcia “the aggressor there,” in his shouting match with Maldonado.
The whole mess took more than 10 minutes, which Rangers manager Bruce Bochy fumed about, since Leclerc’s outing spanned the eighth and ninth innings.
“I think sometimes when we’re on the field,” says Hoye, “it feels like it’s a long time. But I’d rather take that 20 to 30 seconds to make sure we’re getting it right.”
It was hard to find anyone agreeing with that last sentiment.
“Nobody’s trying to hit anybody in that situation,” says Pressly. “If you’re going to do that kind of stuff, you’re going to do it in the regular season. You’re not going to do it in the postseason.”
Says Verlander: “In that spot I don't know how those six guys got together and determined that they were sure it was intentional, because I think from a baseball perspective, it surely was not.”
The Astros also insisted they weren’t mad at Garcia’s home run trot, that gaudy celebrations are the way of the baseball world. Garcia left open the possibility Abreu dotted him on purpose.
“You hit a ball like that, you're going to celebrate,” says Garcia through a club translator. “It's where we're at right now. So I don't think that that's a way for them -- if they're trying to react to that, I don't think that's the correct way.”
Hogwash, says the Astros.
“I’m the kind of guy, I don’t care about celebrations,” says Abreu, who had a brief exchange with Garcia during the scrum. “That was a big, big moment for him. He got the chance to celebrate, do whatever he wants.
“I went in and was saying, hey, my bad, it wasn’t on purpose. He said, ‘Hey, bull(expletive). “I said, OK, I’m done. You’re hot. I just tried to move back.”
Soon, it was the Astros getting hot. Correlating Altuve’s blast with Garcia’s fuse-lighting is, of course, pure folly. But it is the Astros going home with the ALCS lead, and the Astros left to shape the narrative that Garcia’s instigating awoke a championship bear.
“Yes, of course it did,” says Maldonado.
They’ll have two shots to return to the World Series for a third consecutive year, all thanks to perhaps their most remarkable triumph in seven dominant years.
“I love this team,” says Pressly. “It’s just a different animal in this clubhouse.”
A key border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened Saturday to allow the first humanitarian aid to reach the besieged territory since the latest war between Israel and Hamas began.
Two weeks after the militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack in southern Israel and the country responded by sealing off and shelling the Gaza Strip where Hamas rules, a 20-truck convoy entered Gaza carrying desperately needed supplies.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is catastrophic, international groups have warned, as Palestinians are rationing food, drinking dirty water and hospitals are overwhelmed with injured and running low on supplies.
Two trucks that entered Gaza from Egypt are carrying over 44,000 bottles of drinking water from the U.N. children's agency – a day's supply for 22,000 people, according to UNICEF.
Israel continues to launch strikes into Gaza that have leveled neighborhoods, and has warned of a coming ground invasion. About half of the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians have fled their homes. Gaza officials say Israel's strikes have killed over 4,000 people. In Israel, more than 1,400 people have died — mostly civilians who died during the Hamas incursion.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the first aid delivery but said more is needed, and said Hamas must not steal the aid or prevent it from getting to civilians who need it.
“With this convoy, the international community is beginning to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza that has left residents of Gaza without access to sufficient food, water, medical care, and safe shelter," Blinken said in a statement. "We urge all parties to keep the Rafah crossing open to enable the continued movement of aid that is imperative to the welfare of the people of Gaza."
Aid groups say the supplies let in Saturday are not nearly enough, and more than 200 trucks carrying roughly 3,000 tons of aid have been positioned near the crossing for days. The amount of supplies entering Gaza Saturday pales in comparison to what was routinely sent into the occupied territory on a daily basis before the war started, Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program, told The Associated Press.
“We need many, many, many more trucks and a continual flow of aid," she said, noting about 400 trucks used to enter Gaza daily.
Israel had previously said nothing would enter Gaza until Hamas released the over 200 hostages taken during its rampage two weeks ago. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said aid would be delivered only to southern Gaza, where the army has ordered people to relocate, adding that no fuel would enter the territory.
The opening of the border came hours after officials announced Hamas had released an American woman and her teenage daughter, who were taken captive while visiting Israel. It wasn't clear if the release of the hostages and the delivery of aid to Gaza were related.
Latest developments:
∎ The explosion at Gaza’s al-Ahli Arab Hospital on Tuesday that U.S. officials estimate killed between 100 and 300 people was likely caused by the breaking up of a rocket that was fired from within Palestinian territory, an analysis by the Associated Press concluded.
∎ Fighting has intensified along Israel's border with Lebanon, with Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters exchanging fire Saturday in several areas along the border.
∎ Former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, a child of Palestinian and Syrian immigrants, said Friday that several of his relatives died at Saint Porphyrios Orthodox Church where they had been sheltering when an Israeli airstrike hit late Thursday. Israel acknowledged the blast and said the church wasn't its intended target.
Two Americans, Judith Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie, were released Friday after being held captive by Hamas for nearly two weeks, officials said.
They were the first hostages released by the militant group, which took some 200 people captive in its rampage in southern Israel on Oct. 7. They were in the hands of the Israeli military after being released, and Hamas said it released them for humanitarian reasons in an agreement with the Qatari government.
Judith and Natalie Raanan had been visiting Israel from their home of Chicago to celebrate Jewish holidays and were in the kibbutz of Nahal Oz, near Gaza, when the attack began, the family said. Their family hadn't heard from them since the attack.
President Joe Biden spoke with the mother and daughter Friday.
Meir Hecht, a rabbi in Evanston, Illinois, told USA TODAY earlier this week that Judith worked in health care and was a bright, kind and involved member of the community. Her teen daughter recently graduated from Deerfield High School and loved art and animals, he said.
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, and several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for the establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material, and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.

WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court on Friday tentatively sided with the Biden administration and agreed to decide a dispute about whether officials in the White House and federal agencies violated the First Amendment when they leaned on social media companies to suppress content about the election and COVID-19.
Amid a war between Israel and Hamas and a presidential election, the Supreme Court's move Friday allows the Biden administration to continue to interact with social media platforms such as Facebook and X to request that they remove disinformation. By also agreeing to decide the underlying issues in coming months, the high court is once against thrusting itself into a divisive fight at the intersection of social media and the government.
"This is an immensely important case," said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. "These are momentous, thorny issues, and how the court resolves them will have broad implications for the digital public sphere."
Without comment, a majority of the justices halted a lower court's order that blocked federal agencies from "coercing" social media companies like Facebook and X to take down or curtail the spread of social media posts.
Three members of the court's conservative wing − Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch − said they would have sided with the states and social media users who filed the lawsuit.
"Government censorship of private speech is antithetical to our democratic form of government, and therefore today’s decision is highly disturbing," Alito wrote in a dissent. "At this time in the history of our country, what the court has done, I fear, will be seen by some as giving the government a green light to use heavy-handed tactics to skew the presentation of views on the medium that increasingly dominates the dissemination of news."
Second Amendment:Supreme Court blocks parts of Missouri law that declared federal gun prohibitions 'invalid'
The Republican state attorneys general who filed the lawsuit said they were pleased the litigation would be fully aired at the Supreme Court. The court is expected to decide the case by the end of this term, which runs through June.
“This is the worst First Amendment violation in our nation's history," Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, said in a statement. "We look forward to dismantling Joe Biden’s vast censorship enterprise at the nation’s highest court." 
Louisiana Solicitor General Liz Murrill said that the court's decision "brings us one step closer to reestablishing the protections guaranteed to us in the Constitution and under the First Amendment."
The Justice Department declined to comment on Friday.
But the administration has countered in its briefs that officials merely asked those platforms to remove harmful disinformation.  The decision to remove that content was ultimately made by the companies themselves, not the government. Barring the government from flagging disinformation, the administration argued, could have enormous consequences for how Americans interact online.
“It is undisputed that the content-moderation decisions at issue in this case were made by private social-media companies, such as Facebook and YouTube,” the administration told the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court's action on Friday holds in place the status quo before the courts got involved, allowing the administration to proceed − for now − as it had been doing before. By agreeing to hear arguments over and decide the underlying First Amendment questions in the case, the Supreme Court is once again thrusting itself into the messy and heated political debate over online content in the middle of a presidential election.
Born of conservative frustration with social media moderation practices, the lawsuit by the Republican attorneys general from Missouri and Louisiana and several individual users accused the administration of coercing the platforms to remove content that was unfavorable to Democrats. That included posts about the 2020 election, the origins of COVID-19 and the Hunter Biden laptop story.
“When...federal agencies ‘flag’ Americans’ speech to social-media platforms to urge them to take it down, they induce platforms to take action against private speech that the platforms otherwise would not take,” the plaintiffs told the Supreme Court in a brief this month.
The intersection of social media and politics has emerged as significant theme for the Supreme Court this year. Justices will hear arguments Oct. 31 in a pair of challenges dealing with whether public officials may block constituents on social media.
Separately, the high court will decide two suits challenging laws in Texas and Florida that would limit the ability of platforms like Facebook, YouTube and X to moderate content. The state laws at issue in the cases, both of which have been temporarily blocked by federal courts, severely limit the ability of social media companies to kick users off their platforms or remove individual posts.
WASHINGTON – After House Republicans voted to drop Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, as their speaker nominee, a mad dash for the top job has started within the deeply divided House Republican conference.
After voting to abandon Jordan as their nominee by a vote of 112-86, GOP lawmakers are headed home for the weekend to recuperate after a chaotic series of events on Capitol Hill. In the meantime, some Republicans have immediately declared their candidacy with others still considering a run.
House Republicans will hear from prospective speakers when they return to Washington for a candidate forum at 6:30 p.m. Monday.
The earliest the House could elect a new speaker is Tuesday.
Here's who is running for speaker or seriously considering a run.
House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., began making calls to run for speaker after Jordan's exit from the race, according to a source familiar.
As whip, Emmer is the No. 3 ranking House Republican. Ousted former speaker Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., endorsed the Minnesota Republican for the speakership in a huge boost for Emmer's candidacy. McCarthy still commands the respect of the vast majority of the House Republican conference.
"He is the right person for the job. He can unite the conference. He understands the dynamics of the conference. He also understands what it takes to win and keep a majority," McCarthy said to Punchbowl News.
Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., was one of the first candidates who jumped into the speaker's race, immediately announcing his candidacy to reporters after House Republicans dropped Jordan as their nominee.
"We need a different type of leader who has a proven track record of success, which is why I'm running for Speaker of the House," Hern said in a statement.
The Oklahoma Republican is chair of the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of around 170 GOP lawmakers making it the largest group of House Republicans.
Earlier this month, Hern made calls to every single House Republican to gauge support for an earlier run but ultimately decided against it, declining to run against previous speaker nominees Jordan and House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La.
Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., was a little-known lawmaker until earlier this month when he launched a surprise challenge to Jordan's speakership bid as a protest candidate against the conservative firebrand.
Scott ran against Jordan in an internal vote within the House Republican conference to select a nominee. Scott lost the nomination by a vote of 124-81. The Georgia Republican rallied behind Jordan after his loss but Jordan's exit, Scott immediately jumped back in the race.
"There's a lot of people that appreciated what we did," Scott told USA TODAY about his first speaker campaign.
Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, is running for speaker according to a spokesperson from his office.
Donalds has played a large role in key negotiations between moderate and ultraconservative GOP lawmakers. During Jordan's failed speaker elections, some GOP holdouts voted for Donalds as a protest candidate.
As it slowly became clear Jordan could not earn the support he needed in his quest for the speakership before he was dropped as the nominee, Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., considered issuing a challenge to the Ohio Republican but did not follow through.
With Jordan out however, Bergman immediately jumped in the race announcing his candidacy.
"My hat is in the ring, and I feel confident I can win the votes where others could not. I have no special interests to serve; I’m only in this to do what's best for our Nation and to steady the ship for the 118th Congress," Bergman said in a statement.
Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, chair of the House Budget Committee, told reporters he is "seriously considering" running for speaker.
Arrington's name has been floated by several lawmakers as an alternative candidate during Jordan's candidacy but the lawmaker fell behind the Ohio Republicans' speakership bid at the time.
Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., vice chair of the House Republican conference, is currently making calls considering a run for speaker.
“Rep. Johnson is calling his colleagues regarding a run for Speaker," Corinne Day, a spokesperson for Johnson said.
Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, also launched a bid for speaker immediately following Jordan's exit.
"Congressman Sessions believes he can forge a positive path as a conservative leader who can unite the Conference," Sessions' office said in a statement.
For the last four decades, invasive Burmese python snakes have terrorized mammals and the greater ecosystem of the Everglades National Park and throughout South Florida.
Now, a recent study shows what is biting back.
The Southeast Asian apex predator can grow up to 19 feet long, weigh more than 150 pounds and eat everything from rabbits to deer. The pythons and their appetites are also blamed for the disappearance of almost all the fur-bearing mammals in the Everglades and surrounding areas.
A new study by the U.S. Geological Survey and partner organizations in Florida studied the deaths of 19 baby Burmese pythons from May 2021 to February 2022 to see how this part of the python population might meet its fate.
Burmese pythons are difficult to track or monitor, according to Mark Sandfoss, Biologist at Fort Collins Science Center stationed in Everglades National Park. But studies like this provide data points to fill in the gaps of their life cycle.
"It takes a lot of time and effort to collect these data," Sandfoss said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY. "We need more information and are continuing to track juvenile pythons in Southern Florida to understand their ecology, particularly movement, habitat use, and survival."
Burmese pythons:Latest hunt netted over 200 of the invasive species in the Everglades
Burmese pythons are native to Southeast Asia. They were imported to Florida to be sold to pet owners, and were likely released or escaped. They established a wild population in the 1980s, according to the study, and Sandfoss said they can grow to be 19 feet long and weigh more than 150 pounds.
Since then, they have wreaked havoc on the natural environment, eating everything from rabbits to deer with few species being able to check the population. The USGS estimates there are tens of thousands living in the Everglades.
A 2012 study showed that pythons' diets have drastically cut the populations of Everglades-area mammals. Raccoon, opossum and bobcat populations had dropped 85%-99%, and rabbits and foxes had "effectively disappeared."
Humans may be one known predator of the python, but the recent USGS study shows there are more, at least for the babies.
More:Florida will teach you how to hunt, kill Burmese pythons. Practice and you could get paid
Juvenile Burmese pythons were opportunistically collected throughout more than a year. They were implanted with high-frequency radio transmitters equipped with mortality sensors that notified researches when the snake stopped moving for 24 hours.
During the length of the study, 19 baby snakes died. At that point, scientists would go to the scene of the crime and conduct some detective work to discover the cause of death.
Here is what they found:
Among the deceased juveniles recorded as part of the study, one ambitious snake set a new record for pythons that size. It attempted to eat a hispid cotton rat that weighed 106% of the python's body weight.
The study says this is notable in more ways than one. Its failure to accurately assess prey could be a sign of a maladaptive behaviors due to different prey sizes in the new environment compared to their native environment.
Maladaptive behaviors provide scientists the opportunity to identify potential weaknesses in an invasive species that have otherwise thrived in a new environment, Sandfoss said. While maladaptive behaviors are naturally selected out of the population overtime, the native species can also adapt to the invasive species in that time.
Sandfoss said that, given the wide range of prey that adult pythons eat, scientists did no know if native species had learned to adapt to avoid becoming prey or even become a predator.
He said that the range of predators they found in the study was a pleasant surprise. A cottonmouth snake, for example, would never be able to eat an adult python, but did consume one of the juveniles in the study.
Sandfoss also said that this data is part of a long journey to understand the Burmese python's life cycle in Florida to better aid their population mitigation strategies.
"Our role as scientists is to try to tip the scales in the direction of the native species and identify the weaknesses of the invasive species that we can exploit for management purposes," he said.

“In what kind of case do you think it would be appropriate for a criminal defendant to call the prosecutor a thug and stay on the streets?” U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan asked Donald Trump's attorney John Lauro on Monday during a hearing on whether the former president’s speech should be restricted. 
Lauro didn’t provide the correct answer, which is this: all of them. 
Although it doesn’t appear to be a common occurrence – there’s only one published instance where a defendant allegedly admitted to calling the U.S. attorney assigned to his case names – this happens often enough. Criminal defendants have just as much disdain for prosecutors as the prosecutors have for them. Their displeasure is expressed outside of court. The only difference with Trump’s calling special counsel Jack Smith a thug is that no one was listening when these other defendants insulted their prosecutors. 
Talking smack is part of the game. To suggest that it doesn’t happen is not only disingenuous on Judge Chutkan’s part, it’s also a misunderstanding of the importance of the defendant’s voice in criminal cases – one that could prove unconstitutional. It’s almost like the former public defender doesn’t understand defense.
A defendant’s rights may be in tension with the First Amendment rights of the news media, but that’s not what’s happening with the former president. This isn’t even a situation where a lawyer’s speech is restrained. That has happened in the past on occasion, such as the gag order in the trial of the Los Angeles police officers accused of beating Rodney King. Those are the two situations that courts have reviewed in the past, but telling a defendant he can’t speak is unprecedented.
In the federal election conspiracy case against Trump – he could be facing 55 years in prison if convicted and sentenced to the maximum on each of the four conspiracy and obstruction charges – what Chutkan did was the inverse of a Fifth Amendment violation.
If the judge had compelled Trump to speak somehow, that would be a clear violation of his right not to incriminate himself – namely, to keep himself un-convicted and free. Yet, when he wants to say something that he thinks would keep himself un-convicted and free, she’s stepping on that right. 
Judge issues partial gag order:Trump, who never shuts up, now has a gag order to whine about. And you know he will.
While for some it might be wise not to testify in one’s own defense, some studies suggest an acquittal is more likely when a defendant tells their story.  
Even if taking the witness stand in one’s own criminal case is ill-advised, defendants can't legally be stopped from speaking to protect themselves. The Supreme Court has held that preventing someone from testifying in court in a case against themselves violates the due process clause of the 14th Amendment and the compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment.
There have been very few studies of the First Amendment’s role in criminal courtrooms. One, authored by George Washington University Law School professor Daniel Solove, examines the ways that the First Amendment operates with the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and how government searches of suspects’ intellectual property deserves more attention.
In the article, Solove argued that the First Amendment doesn’t get enough consideration in criminal courtrooms but, notably, doesn’t even mention a case of a court telling a defendant not to speak. It’s practically unthinkable. 
Because criminal cases threaten an individual’s freedom and possibly life, courts have to give a defendant more leeway in speech. That’s why in People v. O.J. Simpson, there were no gag orders in the criminal case under former Superior Court Judge Lance Ito – Ito floated the idea but never followed through on it.
However, the judge assigned to the subsequent civil case filed by Ron Goldman’s family restricted speech of the parties in what has been called a “sweeping” order. All that was at stake in those civil proceedings was civil liability – i.e., money.  
Chutkan’s – and the public’s – inability to equalize the First and Fifth Amendments as they pertain to criminal defendants shows just how hard it is to convince people that every accused person is innocent – until they’re convicted and they may be actually innocent after that, too. If there’s a defense to be made, there’s no reason why the defendant shouldn’t be able to speak it. In fact, for people whose freedom is jeopardized, the right to speak becomes even more important. 
Don't obstruct sentencing reform:First Step Act advanced prison reform, but hundreds are still serving unjust sentences
The judge was correct when she said that the former president “does not have the right to say and do exactly what he pleases.” He doesn’t. He can’t threaten people. 
And laws exist to cover that. They’re in the criminal code of every state and the federal government, and if law enforcement thinks Trump violated those statutes then he should be charged as anyone else would be. 
The constitutional fallout of Chutkan’s partial gag order is yet to be seen; Trump has said that he’ll appeal it before the case is over.
Stopping him from speaking is stopping him from defending himself, and that’s something no judge presiding over a criminal case should ever be allowed to do.

The expansive Murdaugh family estate is back on the market, just a few months after it sold for $3.9 million.
However, not all 1,700 acres of it, including the kennels where lawyer Richard "Alex" Murdaugh killed his wife and younger son, is on sale.
A 4-bedroom home on Moselle, the South Carolina estate where the Murdaughs lived prior to the tragedy, has gone on sale for $1.95 million. The home, which served as the primary Murdaugh residence, the Moselle Estate House, is located on only 21 acres of land, according to listing agent Crosby Land Company.
Located approximately 70 miles from Charleston, the Moselle Estate House is private and secluded, surrounded by upland open fields and a mature old growth hardwood forest, the home's listing notes.
Crosby describes the listing as a "unique property" that could serve as a "a family residence or compound" or allow new buyers to engage in "equestrian pursuits, [a] hobby farm, or just a weekend retreat destination."
"The 4 bedroom / 4.5 bathroom residence is a sprawling 5,275 square foot home that exudes character, charm, and high-end finishes," says Crosby in a property listing.
The Moselle house, which stands out in its surrounding with a white outlook, is characterized by front and back porches. Custom built in 2011, it also boasts mahogany doors, heart pine floors, a grand staircase, a chef's kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances and granite countertops, a billiards room and custom gun cabinets.
Alex Murdaugh trial:Murdaugh requests new murder trial, alleges jury tampering in appeal
Given its history, the property is bound to attract a lot of curiosity, but the Crosby Land Company explicitly states that all potential buyers must be pre-approved for purchase before visiting the home for a showing.
Broker Todd Crosby told The Daily Beast that though the house's notoriety may complicate the sale, his office is ensuring that all potential buyers are vetted “pretty hard” to make sure they are serious buyers and not just “being nosy.”
“I don’t care what the buyer’s deal is with the house,” Crosby told the media outlet. “Murders happen in houses all the time. I just want to make sure the buyers we bring to the house can cut the check and don’t just want to see the house for fun.”
The 1,700 acres family estate was purchased by James A. Ayer and Jeffrey L. Godley in March, according to the Greenville News, part of the USA TODAY Network. The proceeds of the sale were divided between several parties including the Murdaugh family's surviving son, Buster, Murdaugh's younger brother John Marvin Murdaugh, and victims of a 2019 boat crash involving Paul, among others.
Alex Murdaugh was convicted in March of killing his wife Maggie Murdaugh and son Paul near the family dog kennels, about a quarter mile from the house on June 7, 2021.
Murdaugh was convicted of two counts of murder during a six-week trial in Walterboro, South Carolina. The trial concluded on March 3, 2023, with Judge Clifton Newman sentencing him to two life sentences.
However, Murdaugh's defense team petitioned for a new trial in September, alleging Colleton County Clerk of Court Rebecca Hill of inappropriate communications with jurors, denying their client a fair trial. The lawyers contend Hill's communications may have helped remove jurors sympathetic Murdaugh and swayed others.
The petition was approved on Tuesday. The South Carolina Court of Appeals stayed Murdaugh's murder convictions and twin life sentences, putting the outcome of that case on hold until a lower court hears Murdaugh's request for a fresh trial.

A fun outing at a pecan festival in Texas took a scary turn when a gust of wind launched a carnival ride car into the air and left its operator dangling 30 feet above the ground.
The ride operator was helping 12-year-old Juliana Bernal get into one of the cars on The Bullet at the 54th annual Groves Pecan Festival on Sunday afternoon in Groves, Texas, about 90 miles east of Houston near the Louisiana state line, reported KMBT-TV
A strong gust of wind suddenly propelled the car into the air with Juliana inside as the ride operator held onto the door to keep it shut and protect her, the station reported. He managed to do that all while the compartment turned 180 degrees and stalled 30 feet from the ground.
Video footage of the accident shared by KFDM-TV showed the operator hanging from the ride with his legs dangling in the air as people screamed and watched in horror.
Now he's being hailed as a hero.

Juliana's mother, Caress Muraira, told KMBT-TV that watching the incident unfold was one of the scariest moments of her life.
"It started going slow at first and he was trying to stop it, her door wasn't closed," she said. "So I started freaking out. As he went to close the door he just kind of flew up with it. My daughter was up there and talking to him saying, 'Please hang on. Don't fall.'"
Juliana also kept telling Muraira: "Mommy, I'm OK," she said.
It "felt like the longest time of my life," before employees were able to get the ride's motor going and lower the ride, bringing both the operator and Juliana to safety. Just before that the employees quickly removed a handful of children who were in a ground-level compartment of the ride.
The Bullet was shut down for the rest of the event.
Muraira said that she was immensely grateful to the ride operator for risking his life for her daughter.

Groves City Marshal Norman Reynolds told KMBT-TV that the ride operator was shaken up after the ordeal.
Muraira said that her daughter told her that she saw blood on the operator's fingers from where he was holding onto the ride.
A spokesperson for the festival organizer, the Groves Chamber of Commerce, told USA TODAY on Wednesday that the ride operator was fine and that they are not aware of any injuries.
Organized by the Groves Chamber of Commerce since 1969, the Groves Pecan Festival is a community-wide celebration that coincides with the yearly pecan harvest. Pecans are an integral part of the Groves landscape and have been a focal point for community growth, the chamber of commerce says.
A spate of recent incidents related to amusement rides and attraction has left riders stuck or injured.
On Sept. 29, an 8-year-old boy sustained significant injuries when he was "sucked out" of his seat on a ride called The Storm at the State Fair of Virginia.
In August, guests were forced to walk down a 200-plus-foot roller coaster at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio after the ride known as the Magnum XL experienced a mechanical issue.
Back in July, fairgoers in Crandon, Wisconsin, ended up in a terrifying predicament when a malfunction left riders stuck upside down for hours.
Just two days before that, a North Carolina amusement park closed one of its rollercoasters after guests noticed a crack in a support pillars and video showed pieces moving out of place as cars moved along the tracks.

PHOENIX — The Philadelphia Phillies spent the whole winter thinking about just how close they were to a World Series title last October before falling just short.
They spent the entire summer knowing there’s only one destination that would ever be acceptable in October.
“We’ve got to get to the World Series," Phillies owner John Middleton said Friday afternoon.
Well, they may be spending this winter wondering what in the world just went wrong, with veteran closer Craig Kimbrel melting down at the worst possible time.
Kimbrel blew the game – and perhaps the Phillies’ season – Friday night with the Arizona Diamondbacks pulling off a stunning 6-5 victory, and tying the National League Championship Series at two games apiece.
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
The Phillies were cruising with a 5-3 lead, just six outs away from taking a commanding 3-1 lead in the series when Kimbrel entered the game.
He gave up a leadoff double to Lourdes Gurriel, retired Evan Longoria on a long fly ball to left field, and on a full count, watched in horror as pinch-hitter Alek Thomas hit a two-run home run, tying the game as the sellout crowd of 47,306 went berserk.
Four batters later, Gabriel Moreno lined a single into center field, providing the D-backs with a dramatic comeback victory.
The Phillies still have Zack Wheeler, Aaron Nola and Ranger Suarez lined up the next three games, but the D-backs counter with Zac Gallen, Merrill Kelly and Brandon Pfaadt.
If this series was supposed to be a cakewalk, someone forget to tell the Diamondbacks.
Even with their power-hitting trio of Corbin Carroll (1-15), Christian Walker (1-12) and Tommy Pham (1-13) have gone 3-40 (.075), they still have managed to tie this series.
The Phillies' powerful offense scored just one run in 12 innings at Chase Field until Kyle Schwarber’s 409-foot leadoff homer in the fourth inning, the 19th of his postseason career, the most by a left-handed hitter in history.
With game tied 2-2, the D-backs’ bullpen unraveled in the sixth inning when left-handed rookie reliever Andrew Saalfrank walked the bases loaded without an out. He was instantly removed with Ryan Thompson becoming their sixth pitcher of the game, leaving the D-backs without a lefty for the rest of the game.
The Phillies wasted no time capitalizing.
Third baseman Alec Bohm hit a chopper to third baseman Emmanuel Rivera that took him wide of the bag. He threw off-balance home, but the ball got away from catcher Gabriel Moreno, and by the time he retrieved it, two runs scored for a 4-2 lead.
The Phillies added another run in the seventh with Johan Rojas’ leadoff triple and Trea Turner’s sacrifice fly, but just when it looked like it would be a blowout, it was the Phillies’ bullpen that collapsed.
In the words of D-backs manager Torey Lovullo: “The narrative has changed."
Oh, has it ever.

Here's how Game 4 unfolded (by USA TODAY Sports staff):
With a two-run lead, Phillies pitcher Craig Kimbrel melted down in the eighth inning.
Lourdes Gurriel Jr. lead off with a double and Alek Thomas hit a two-run homer in the pool at Chase Field to tie the game 5-5. Kimbrel gave up a single to Ketel Marte and hit Corbin Carroll, getting the hook in favor of Jose Alvarado with two on and two outs.
Alvarado fell behind 3-0 on Gabriel Moreno and on the fifth pitch, Arizona's young catcher lined an RBI single to give the D-backs the lead.
The Diamondbacks loaded the bases with two outs – a single and two walks – and Christian Walker drew another free pass to bring Geraldo Pedromo to score, cutting the Phillies' lead to 5-3.
With the bases still loaded, Orion Kerkerin got Pavin Smith to ground out to first as Arizona stranded three runners.
Johan Rojas tripled with one out in the top of the seventh and Trea Turner followed up with a sacrifice fly to left, bringing in a run to extend the Phillies' lead to 5-2 against Diamondbacks reliever Ryan Thompson.
With the bases loaded and nobody out, Alec Bohm's ground ball was fielded by Arizona third baseman Emannuel Rivera whose off-balance throw to the plate wasn't handled by catcher Gabriel Moreno. The ball got away allowing a second run to score – while Bohm got thrown out trying to advance to second. Rivera was charged with a throwing error on the play in the top of the sixth.
With runners on second and third and one out, Ryan Thompson struck out J.T. Realmuto and got Nick Castellanos to ground out to limit the damage.
Philadelphia's Brandon Marsh delivered a two-out RBI double in the top of the fifth inning to tie the game 2-2 against Arizona lefty Andrew Saalfrank.
It was catcher J.T. Realmuto, who had singled earlier in the frame, that came around to score the Phillies' second run.
Kyle Schwarber's solo homer off Kyle Nelson in the top of the fourth was 19th career postseason home run, breaking a tie with Reggie Jackson for most by a left-handed hitter.
Nelson was pulled after Schwarber's leadoff homer, with Miguel Castro coming in to get the last three outs of the fourth.
Gabriel Moreno's RBI single against Phillies reliever Jeff Hoffman brought Ketel Marte around to score in the bottom of the third, extending Arizona's lead to 2-0.
Hoffman replaced starter Cristopher Sánchez, allowing the inherited runner to score against the first batter he faced.
Lourdes Gurriel Jr. wowed the fans at Chase Field with a sterling defensive play in the top of the second inning. The Diamondbacks left field robbed Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto of extra bases with a leaping catch up against the wall, near the 374 sign.
In the bottom of the frame, Arizona got the leadoff man on when Christian Walker reached on a throwing error by third baseman Alec Bohm before Tommy Pham struck out and Gurriel grounded into a fielder's choice, with Walker going to second. Following a passed ball by Realmuto and walk to Evan Longoria, Emmanuel Rivera singled to center field to plate Walker to give the Diamondbacks a 1-0 lead after two innings.
Trea Turner had been riding an impressive stolen base streak, but the Phillies shortstop was finally cut down after 40 consecutive stolen bases, dating back to last season.
Turner, batting second in the top of the first inning, singled to right following a Kyle Schwarber strikeout. But with star Bryce Harper at the plate, Turner took off on Arizona starter Joe Mantiply's first move and was picked off with Diamondbacks shortstop Geraldo Perdomo tagging him out at second. Harper then grounded out to second baseman Ketel Marte to end the top of the first.
Turner had been succesful on 34 of 34 stolen base attempts this season, including the playoffs.
Game 4 of the NLCS on Friday is scheduled to begin at 8:07 p.m. ET, airing on TBS.
Philadelphia Phillies
Cristopher Sánchez will make his 2023 playoff debut when he starts Game 4 for the Phillies on Thursday. The LHP started 18 games for Philadelphia this season, going 3-5 with a 3.44 ERA and 96 strikeouts. Sánchez last started Sept. 24 against the New York Mets, earning the win after allowing three hits and two runs, while striking out 10 in seven innings.
Arizona Diamondbacks
Joe Mantiply will start what is likely to be a bullpen game for the Diamondbacks. The LHP gave up three runs in less than an inning of relief in Philadelphia’s Game 2 win, but he was spotless in the NLDS and NL wild card series, allowing no hits in 2 ⅔ innings. Mantiply appeared in 35 regular-season games, starting just three, and went 2-2 with a 4.63 ERA and 28 strikeouts in 39 innings.
For the second consecutive game, the roof at Chase Field in Phoenix will be closed. With temperatures around 102 degrees for the first pitch, scheduled for shortly after 5 p.m. local time, Game 4 of the NLCS will once again take place in an enclosed environment.
With the roof closed in 2023, Chase Field tied for the third-fewest runs allowed (out of MLB’s eight enclosed ballparks), according to Statcast, behind Seattle's T-Mobile Park and Toronto's Rogers Centre. And only T-Mobile Park was less homer-friendly with a closed roof, with the Mariners' stadium yielding 68 home runs to the Chase Field's 78.
PHOENIX – When Arizona Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo removed Game starting pitcher Brandon Pfaadt in the sixth inning of Game 3, the 47,075 fans at Chase Field let him have it.
The D-backs’ 25-year-old rookie was pitching the greatest game of his career Thursday and had given up just two hits, striking out nine, while throwing just 70 pitches in 5⅔ shutout innings. Pfaadt joined Don Newcombe of the 1949 Brooklyn Dodgers as the only rookies to strike out at least nine batters without a walk in postseason history.
Still, Lovullo walked to the mound, and was serenaded by loud boos, with fans showing their disgust at the decision.
“I'm sure I was the most unpopular guy in the city of Phoenix, in the downtown area, and maybe in the entire state of Arizona, right? I was booing myself as I walked out to the mound," Lovullo said. “I didn’t need to be in the stands. … 
“I want everybody to know, that is trying to think along with me, that we have a strategy. I have a strategy for everything that's done. Everything that's done has been well talked about. It's not just analytics. I know how quickly playoff baseball can change. 
“So, yes, I am prepared to get booed. I am prepared to get second-guessed. It's my job."
The decision to remove him was mostly scripted, with Lovullo saying before the game that he was counting on Pfaadt to face about 18 batters, which was exactly number Pfaadt saw. Yet, Lovullo brushed back at the notion it was simply a matter of analytics or that a decision was made without discussing it with pitching coach Brent Strom and his staff.
“I’m asking them if the manager is an idiot after taking his out after five and two-thirds [innings]. I know it's a very unpopular decision, but we have great information."

This is the second time this year that Neena Nizar’s wheelchair was damaged on a flight, and she said it’s much worse now.
“My wheelchair is totaled. I’ve had it break before but not like this,” she told USA TODAY.
Nizar was flying home to Nebraska from Vancouver via Denver on United Airlines on Oct. 13, and she said she watched her wheelchair fall off the baggage belt after landing in Omaha.
“There was nobody holding it, and there was nobody there to receive it so it fell right off,” she said. “That’s crazy, it’s like, are you kidding me?” 
In May, the chair’s armrests were damaged after a flight on Southwest Airlines, but the device was still usable. Now, Nizar said, her wheelchair won’t even turn on.
Nizar realized the extent of the damage on the jet bridge and ultimately spent hours in the Omaha airport after her flight trying to see what recourse was available before eventually being pushed in her non-functioning wheelchair to the airport entrance and carried and driven home by her husband.
“I just started crying, I was so upset, I said, ‘how could you do this?’ ” she said. “I was numb, I was just in shock.”
United Airlines acknowledged the incident in a statement to USA TODAY.
“We’ve been working with Ms. Nizar to get her a high-end loaner chair and her preferred vendor is currently assessing her wheelchair. We’ve apologized to Ms. Nizar and will cover the cost of repairs or a replacement, depending on the final assessment,” the statement said.
But Nizar said simply replacing her chair isn’t nearly sufficient compensation.
“I can’t walk my dog. I can’t go to the grocery. It was my son’s birthday the other day and I needed to go to the store multiple times and I couldn’t … I teach and I need to be able to go out and teach as well and I can’t do that,” she said. “I have to rearrange everything and they're not going to compensate for any of this.”
For now, Nizar said, she’s stuck at home until she gets her chair replaced or a fully-functional loaner.
“I asked them how am I going to get to work, how am I going to continue to be able to put food on the table for my family if I can’t get around?” she said. “The response from one of the customer service people was ‘have someone drive you’ and it’s like, ‘what? This isn’t my car that broke down, this is my wheelchair, this is like my legs.’ They just don’t understand.” 
Nizar said it could take up to a year for her chair to be fully replaced, because the device needs to be custom fit to her body. She said the whole situation makes her feel unwanted by the travel industry.
“I just feel even more angry that we are isolating this whole section of society who otherwise would be productive and moving around and working … It’s almost like a fear mechanism you’ve created that prevents people from doing what they need to do,” she said. “It’s not an option for me to stop traveling and I don’t want to stop traveling because it’s my right to travel.”
According to the Department of Transportation, airlines "mishandle" on average about 1.5% of the mobility equipment they transport. In 2022, that translated to 11,389 incidents reported by U.S. airlines, up from 7,239 in 2021.
This year, USA TODAY wants to highlight what those figures mean for travelers with disabilities. We're looking to track these incidents throughout 2023 with the goal of bringing light to an all-too-common problem.

While much of the world races to put keyboards on as many instruments as possible, one state has just made a law to ensure that students are taught how to put pen to paper.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law a bill that requires the teaching of cursive writing across the state.
California Assembly Bill 446 amends the state's education code to include, "instruction in cursive or joined italics in the appropriate grade levels," for grades one through six.
The bill turned law's author, California Assembly Member Sharon Quirk-Silva of Fullerton, told the Sacramento Bee that the bill is intended to help students to be able to read and write in cursive with the benefit of being able read primary source historical documents.
“A lot of the historical documents going back two or three decades are actually in cursive,” Quirk-Silva, a former elementary school teacher, said. “I went on 23andMe looking for some family records and they were all written in cursive.
While the teaching of cursive may feel anachronistic, the skill may help expand the ability of students to learn.
A 2020 study from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology found that students writing in cursive activated different electrical activity in the brain as compared to typing and argued that "young children should learn to write by hand successfully, and, at the same time learn to manage to write on a keyboard."
Open polluting:New California law will require large corporations to reveal carbon emissions by 2026
While California is the latest to add cursive back into its educational standards, it is not alone. 17 states have laws on the books requiring cursive to be taught.
Here they are:
The footage from the ceremony quieted from routine clapping for the graduates crossing the stage at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans as the university president and everyone else in the auditorium spotted Aiyana Jones arriving in a wheelchair.
The crowd at the historically Black Catholic university's Convocation Center rose to its feet for the 22-year-old graduating with a biology degree and a Spanish minor.
A man fatally shot by Georgia police during a traffic stop had previously served 16 years in prison after a wrongful conviction.
A Camden County deputy pulled 53-year-old Leonard Allan Cure over at about 7:30 a.m. Monday on Interstate 95, according to a statement issued by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
The bureau says that Cure got out of his car upon the deputy's request and otherwise complied until he learned he would be arrested.
"After not complying with the deputy's requests," the deputy stunned him with a Taser. After that, "Cure assaulted the deputy," who used a baton and again a Taser on Cure, the bureau said.
"Cure still did not comply. The deputy pulled out his gun and shot Cure," the bureau said.
Paramedics treated Cure at the scene but he later died. The deputy was not injured.
'A nightmare':Man who nearly got death penalty for murder he didn't commit is declared innocent
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation told USA TODAY on Tuesday that the deputy pulled Cure over for reckless driving and speeding.
The Camden County Sheriff's Office told USA TODAY that Cure was speeding at 90-plus mph.
On Wednesday, the sheriff's office released patrol car and body camera videos of the fatal incident
"Camden County Sheriff Jim Proctor, along with District Attorney Keith Higgins of the Brunswick Judicial Circuit, and GBI Agents investigating the case decided this morning to make the videos available for public review in an effort to be completely transparent as to what happened, and how the incident escalated to the point of extreme Use of Force," the sheriff's department wrote on Facebook.
The officer who the Los Angeles Times confirmed to be Staff Sgt. Buck Aldridge, can be seen pulling Cure over. The Camden County Sheriff's office did not respond to USA TODAYS request for additional information on the deputy involved.
Aldridge asks Cure to get out of the car, which he does, but he then refuses to put his hands on the truck.
“I ain’t doing s---,” Cure can be heard telling the deputy.
The exchanged gets tense quickly as Aldridge tells Cure that he'll use a stun gun if he doesn't comply. Cure complies and asks why he's being pulled over.
“You passed me doing 100 miles per hour ,” the deputy said, before asking Cure to put his hands behind his back.
The speed limit was 70 mph.
Cure ignores the Aldridge command and the officer tases him. The shock from the taser causes Cure to flail before turning around and grabbing the officer. The two get into a physical fight on the side of the highway. Both had their hands around the others neck.
Aldridge hits Cure with baton, but he doesn't let go. Then a shot can be heard, and Cure falls to the ground. The deputy, yells at him to stay down, before getting on the radio and calling for help.
“Shots fired, suspect down!” Aldridge says. “Send help!”
Emergency personnel show up and try to revive Cure, but he's pronounced dead at the scene.
Cure was arrested on Nov. 20, 2003 in Florida on charges of robbery with a firearm and assault with a firearm, according to the Florida Innocence Project.
His arrest stemmed from the robbery of Walgreen's in Dania Beach after one of the victims picked him out of a line-up. The jury in his first trial was deadlocked, but a second jury found Cure guilty.
He was sentenced to life in prison in 2004. In 2020, the Broward State Attorney’s Office's Conviction Review Unit asked a judge for his release, the Sun Sentinel reported.
A judge vacated Cure's convictions in 2020, exonerating him and ordering his release from prison after 16 years.
The Florida Innocence Project said that eyewitness misidentification, official misconduct and ineffective legal counsel contributed to his conviction. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a claims bill in June that awarded Cure $817,000 in compensation for the wrongful imprisonment.

The Florida Innocence Project did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment but in a statement to the Associated Press, executive director Seth Miller said he was devastated by the news of Cure's death.
“I can only imagine what it’s like to know your son is innocent and watch him be sentenced to life in prison, to be exonerated and ... then be told that once he’s been freed, he’s been shot dead,” Miller said.
On Wednesday, Cure's family alongside civil rights attorney Ben Crump held a press conference in front of the Camden County Courthouse before the release of the videos.
Crump said Cure recently bought a house in Georgia and was driving home from visiting his mother, Mary Cure, in Florida.
Cure's mother said she was heartbroken by the loss of her son who said he lived in constant fear of being arrested and imprisoned again. The family said shooting Cure was unnecessary.
“I don’t feel, no matter what happened, that he should have been killed,” Mary Cure said.
Crump said the deputy was acting aggressively from the start of the interaction and could have deescalated the situation.
Cure's family acknowledged that he did become a "bit physical" but for the most part was compliant. The officer, they said, did not try to diffuse the situation and Cure may have been dealing with mental health issues as a result of his wrongful incarceration.
“The officer just triggered him,” Cure's brother Michael said. “It was excitement met with excitement.”
WJXT-TV reported that they obtained the officer's personnel files, which show he has a history of using excessive force during traffic stops. USA TODAY was not able to independently verify the claims.
“He really should be alive,” Cure's brother Michael said. “The officer hit him with his baton and he tased him, twice as a matter of fact. But he did not have to shoot him.”
In a statement posted to Facebook, Broward State Attorney Harold F. Pryor said that Cure was the first person exonerated by his office's Conviction Review Unit.
"The Leonard we knew was a smart, funny and kind person," Pryor said. "After he was freed and exonerated by our office, he visited prosecutors at our office and participated in training to help our staff do their jobs in the fairest and most thorough way possible."
Pryor said that Cure would frequently check in on the head of the review unit "and offer our team encouragement to continue to do the important work of justice."
"He had been working a job in security, he was hoping to go to college and wanted to work in broadcast radio production, he was buying his first home," he said. "We send our sincerest condolences to his family and all who knew him."
The sheriff's office said Aldridge has been placed on administrative leave.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigations is still investigating the fatal shooting. The bureau will send it's finding to Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Keith Higgins. Higgins who met with Cure's family on Wednesday, will ultimately decide whether to pursue charges against Aldridge.
After 75-year-old Bay View, Wisconsin, resident Paul Bailey won a gun auction through GunBroker.com in August, he received a UPS tracking number for the package and awaited his new gun's arrival.
But it never made it to the gun store a couple of hours away in Mequon where Bailey was scheduled to pick it up.
It was a dramatic night of pickeball and ATVs as “Golden Bachelor” Gerry Turner said goodbye to three more contestants vying for his heart: retired interior designer Nancy, who bowed out of the competition before the rose ceremony; therapist April, who made a memorable impression on the contestants during a game of Never Have I Ever; and retired educational consultant Kathy, whose conflict with Theresa injected drama into the house last week.
Although last week’s confrontation between Kathy and Theresa spilled over into Thursday’s Episode 4, it was Theresa who got the final rose as Kathy said her goodbyes and left the mansion.
For Kathy, she has no regrets about her “Golden Bachelor” experience.
“I am a direct person and I do speak my mind, and that’s who I am. And not everybody’s going to love me and I’m good with that,” Kathy, 70, told USA TODAY. “I think that Theresa’s words had a very strong impact – not just on me, on many of the women in the house. And that’s really all I can say about that.”
She added, “At the end of the day, I only wish Theresa well.” 
While Kathy was only one of three women who didn’t make the cut Thursday night, she said she wasn’t surprised by Gerry’s decisions. “Nothing drastic was happening off camera other than we would sit and chit-chat, and you could just feel and you could see that some of the women felt that they really felt a connection with him right from the beginning. And there were others of us that took a ‘wait-and-see’ approach.”
Despite her journey in the mansion ending, Kathy said it’s been the start of many friendships: the “ASKN crew” (April, Susan, Kathy, and Nancy) have remained close, and are even planning a trip to Saint Martin together in January.
Kathy also emphasized that she came to the show with the intention of falling in love.
"I think that when you meet someone, I mean, Gerry's a very good looking guy. There's no doubt about it. But I think as you get to know someone, you look at that person and and make some judgments. Look, I was married. Happily married, almost 46 years. And my husband took his life by suicide," she said.
A few years ago, she committed to saying “yes” to adventures and new opportunities.
“Love isn’t just for 20- or 30-somethings. I’m 70 years old and I’m active and I believe in love. I believe that you can find love on this show. I believe that people just need to get up off the sofa and have experiences and live their life,” she said. “We only get one chance, you know? We only get one go-round here. So I think that hopefully that America will see that life isn’t over at 60. For many of us, it’s a second chance at love. It’s a second chance for life.”
And if the opportunity came knocking to perhaps be a “Golden Bachelorette”? “Of course I would do it,” Kathy said. “But you know, I question whether they could find 22 guys who could keep up with me!”

She likes food, cuddles and television.
If you participate all three laid-back activities with the lazy lady, you'll need to turn the TV volume up.
Bella, a 14-year-old cat from Cambridgeshire, England, recently broke the Guinness World Record for loudest purr by a domestic living cat.
The meowy moggy, owned by Nicole Spink, recently registered a purr measuring 54.59 decibels, according to the world record-holding title agency.
Per Guinness, that's the equivalent sound to a kettle boiling.

Bella lives with Spink in Huntingdon, a market town in the Huntingdonshire district of Cambridgeshire, and her owner told Guinness her senior "lazy" cat purrs all day long.
"If there’s food around, or cuddles, she always purrs," Spink told GWS. “Also when watching TV − she likes to be loud with television. My late husband used to always moan about the sound of her purr blocking the sound of the TV in the evenings.”
So Spinks decided to test their theory. She and her daughter (Bella's human sister) downloaded an app on their phone which recorded Bella’s purr. Guinness measured the purr, and Bella's vocals claimed the win.

On the day of the official attempt, according to Guinness, Spink was worried Bella would not purr before "an audience."
"She's a stubborn little old lady, and she does how she pleases," human mom told Guinness. "It is very much Queen Bella's world."
But it didn't take much to get her unique vocals rumbling with content.
Just a bowl of her favorite Whiskas cat food.

Editor's note: Part one of a five-part USA TODAY series revealing why America hasn't solved its long struggle with Type 2 diabetes.
For chef Robin Ray, newly married with young stepchildren, the turning point came when a stabbing chest pain sent her rushing to the emergency room. 
For Brian Castrucci, the gravity hit when the ER doc who had treated him for a near-heart attack a few weeks earlier gave him a big bear hug. “I didn’t think you’d make it,” the doctor said.
The crisis unspooled more slowly for James Haynes but started in 2019 when he stepped on a rusty nail and didn’t notice. 
The moments were turning points for all three to get serious about addressing their diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can’t properly regulate blood sugar, has become so common it’s almost considered inconsequential. More than 1 in 10 Americans have the disease (though many don't know) and another nearly 4 in 10 are at risk for it. In total, half of all adults and a quarter of teenagers have diabetes or pre-diabetes.
Its financial costs are astronomical. The country spends more than $300 billion a year to address diabetes, accounting for $1 out of every $4 spent on health care. 
And its personal tolls are even worse: heart attacks, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, double the risk of premature death. It also causes what’s known as “diabetes distress,” the daily burdens and emotional toll of living with and managing a chronic ailment that can lead to regular dips in energy, foggy thinking and depression, and a sense of isolation.
The most frustrating aspect of Type 2 diabetes, experts say, is that it has long been largely preventable and controllable. 
“We have made tremendous gains in understanding diabetes,” said Dr. Donald Berwick, a pediatrician and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “The best diabetes care can make a very big difference. You can’t say we don’t know what to do.”
And yet, diagnosed rates of Type 2 diabetes have soared over the past 25 years, and especially over the past dozen – particularly among working-age adults like Ray, Castrucci and Haynes. 
Roughly 40% of people who died early in the coronavirus pandemic had Type 2 diabetes, a rate four times higher than people without the disease. Even when elevated blood sugar levels are below the threshold for type 2 diabetes, the risk for heart disease jumps 30% to 50% compared with people with normal blood sugar levels. (Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 5% to 10% of diabetes, is caused by the immune system and is unrelated to diet or lifestyle.)
America’s failure to address Type 2 diabetes highlights larger problems with our food and medical systems, Berwick and other experts said.
A soda costs less than a bottle of water, a double cheeseburger and fries less than a carton of blueberries. Patients wait months for medical appointments only to see the back of a white coat for the short time they’re allotted. Treating disease costs society far more than preventing it but typically provides more profit for insurance companies, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry.
The USA TODAY Health team spoke with scores of health care providers, researchers, community leaders and patients for this five-part series to understand why Type 2 diabetes continues to worsen in America despite known solutions.
The answer isn't simple. It involves systemic problems facing everyone in society, not just those with diabetes: a food system designed to sell products; a medical system in which cutting off a leg is less expensive than saving it; the high cost of healthy living and the fact that breaking habits takes a lot more than just personal willpower.
This first story looks at what it takes for people to cope with or overcome the disease.
Then, we explore one community in a David vs. Goliath battle against a food system that fails to prioritize people's health.

The system is fixable, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.
But it will take "sensible action" from across many sectors, including health care, science, nutrition, business, public health and politics to change the financial and other incentives that drive so many Americans toward sickness instead of health.
"If we do it all, we could fix a lot of this in 10 years," said Mozaffarian, who serves on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. "If we do it incrementally or don't do it at all, we're all going to be toast in 50 years from diet-related illnesses and a depleted environment."
There’s no question personal responsibility plays a role in fighting diabetes. 
Haynes, Ray and Castrucci radically changed their lifestyles and sought help after their come-to-Jesus experiences. They’ve reduced their dependence on daily medication and hope to have saved themselves the horrors of more amputations, blindness and dialysis. They’ve extended their lives and improved the quality of that time.
But like many medical problems, the challenges of diabetes go well beyond individual responsibility and blame. 
“There are structural issues that we have to start paying attention to and addressing,” said Dr. Shivani Agarwal, an endocrinologist who specializes in research and treating young adults with diabetes at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Agarwal recently led a series of studies in the journal The Lancet that looked at diabetes rates around the world. 
Poverty, the studies showed, was a major driver of diabetes, along with racism and unequal access to healthy food and high-quality medical care.
Personal stories illustrate how these structural issues play out in the lives of so many Americans.
Ray, 45, director of culinary operations at HOSCO/North Sarah Food Hub in St. Louis, got weight-loss surgery and then put her culinary expertise to good use.  
Castrucci, 49, who runs a public health nonprofit outside Washington, D.C., used his advantages provided by his work, salary and insurance to “buy” himself better health.
 “I’m healthy because of privilege – not diet, not exercise, not determination,” he said.
Haynes, 58, a former truck driver and maintenance technician in Gulfport, Mississippi, has fewer material assets, but his attitude and the advantages he does have explain why he's still around, despite all he has been through.
“It’s going to be all right after a while, as long as I keep this spirit,” he said.
Ray’s love for food began when she was 8 years old, watching Julia Child on TV. During family gatherings, she would run around taking everyone’s dinner order. Then she’d scurry back to the kitchen with a notepad full of scribbles. 
Throughout her life, she made fried chicken, pork chops, baked mac and cheese, collard greens, and even a whole roasted chicken filled with wild rice and two sticks of butter – everything that made her soul sing. 
In her world, food was home. Food was family. Food was love. 
But that was some pretty tough love. 
In 2002, Ray was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Her father, grandmother, aunts and uncles all had diabetes. She knew what it meant.
“For you to tell me I can’t have ice blue raspberry Kool-Aid was like you shut down my world,” Ray said. “I didn’t want to accept it. So, I ate, because you eat through your emotions.” 
She didn't dwell on the diagnosis and continued with life. Her culinary career took her to Italy, where she learned and fell even more in love with food. She returned to St. Louis, got married and became a mom to her husband’s two children ‒ “beautiful bonus babies,” as she described them. Through the years, she continued to express love through cooking and eating. 
In 2015, a stabbing chest pain sent her to the emergency room. Doctors assured Ray she hadn’t had a heart attack, but they warned that her life was on the line. At 5-foot-2, she weighed 334 pounds and had an A1C, a measure of average blood sugar of 11%, well above the 6.5% cutoff to be considered diabetic. Her diabetes – and her diet – were out of control. 
“That scared me. … It was gut-wrenching and terrifying,” she said. “I’m fighting against something that’s fighting me back and I did not know how to win.” 
She and her primary care doctor decided she would pursue weight loss surgery. 
But she also decided to use her culinary prowess to transform her diet. She reconfigured favorite foods, substituting healthier ingredients: Collard greens cooked in smoked fats or ham hocks turned into a kale, turnip and rutabaga recipe flavored with natural chicken broth fat, oils and seasonings. 
She fostered her feelings into new recipes and brought them to North Sarah Food Hub, which partnered with Barnes-Jewish Hospital to make packaged, pre-made meals for St. Louis residents with diabetes and limited access to fresh food.
“I had to restructure the food that I put in my mouth. I had to think about what I was eating and how I was eating and how it was going to be good for my body,” she said. “I became excited about food again, and food became a joy.” 
It isn’t always easy, of course. Ray admits to an occasional cookie craving. But now she takes the time to think about how her body processes that cookie and whether it’s worthwhile. 
She hopes her cooking can help other people make the same transformation she did. Her staff at North Sarah helps her create new recipes for others. She wants to provide nourishment that allows people to avoid illness and medicine. 
“Nobody wants to take 55 pills, nobody wants to feel like a patient, but how do you fix that? It’s by our food,” she said. “That should be what we’re teaching our community and our culture and our children. … It’s not always about the macaroni noodle with a smile, it’s about what’s good for your body.” 
Castrucci is a third-generation diabetes patient. The lifetime risk of developing Type 2 diabetes if a parent has it is 40%. If both parents have it, the risk jumps to 70%.
He knew he was at risk, but he pushed his luck, he said, by eating poorly during the pandemic and falling out of his exercise routine. With the luxury of working from home, walking to the kitchen and bathroom was often the extent of his daily activity.
On Feb. 14, 2022 – Valentine’s Day – he went to an urgent care clinic, concerned his breathing trouble meant he had bronchitis. His blood pressure measured 210 over 110, well above normal levels that top out at 120 over 80. A chest X-ray showed fluid filling his lungs, leading to congestive heart failure. 
The clinic sent him straight to a local emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a blockage of the left descending artery – a clogged artery made worse by diabetes. If he had waited any longer, he would have had a massive heart attack, his doctor later told him.
After his release from the hospital, he went to the drugstore to fill his new prescriptions. The pharmacist told him she couldn’t fill one because it would cost $1,000. He’d have to wait until his insurance approved it. “Please fill it,” he said. She stressed the cost. “Fill it,” he pleaded, putting the charge on his credit card.
Medication helped him lose 70 pounds in three months. When his local drugstore ran out of the weight-loss drug, he easily drove to another pharmacy and then another to find what he needed. 
His 100 hours of high-quality cardiac rehabilitation were fully covered by insurance.  
"For my midlife crisis, I got healthy," Castrucci said.
He could devote all his energy to getting well because he didn’t have to focus on how to afford his care. “(I) paid almost nothing for the whole episode,” he said, “and never worried about it because I have really good insurance.” 
Even so, Castrucci pays out-of-pocket for a cardiologist and an endocrinologist because the best ones near him don’t accept insurance.
Every time he goes to Walgreens to refill his medications, Castrucci said, he sees someone turned away because they can’t afford their prescriptions. When they finally show up in the emergency room, “because they will,” they will cost the system far more, he said.
“Health outcomes are dictated by economics. It’s a whole side of privilege that we don’t always talk about.”
On the day Haynes stepped on a rusty nail in 2019, he walked all day as the nail pierced the sole of his sneaker and then his foot. By the time he took off his shoe that night, his foot was infected. He landed in the hospital for two months as doctors and nurses tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to get the infection and Haynes’ blood sugar under control.
By the time he was released, he knew enough about Type 2 diabetes to realize his daily blood sugar levels – typically in the mid-400s – were four times above what he had been told to shoot for.
But nothing he did or ate seemed to make a difference. He had long since traded ribs for salads, beer for water. 
His wife, Angela, barely noticed when James started wearing multiple pairs of socks, pouring powder on his feet and buying bigger shoes. His feet tingled a lot, he said, but he was coping with it. 
James ended up in the emergency room again, dehydrated and in need of antibiotics. The doctor amputated the baby toe on his right foot, leaving a large open wound. 
"We're going to leave this open because we'll probably have to take more,” Angela remembered the doctor saying. “I didn't like that we're not going to try to save anything, we're just going to start cutting.”
James was fading.
His arm muscles shriveled and he lost his Popeye physique. Antibiotics left him looking sickly, his voice so weak Angela could barely hear him. “I felt like I was watching my husband slowly dying,” she said.
Finally, taking her doctor sister’s advice, Angela emailed Dr. Foluso Fakorede’s office to ask for an appointment. She thought it would take months to get James in to see the heart disease specialist, but the office called and asked if they could come the next day. 
The Hayneses would end up going back to see Fakorede many times − sometimes twice in one week, driving more than five hours each way from Gulfport north to Cleveland, Mississippi.
“We started looking forward to these visits because there was always hope,” Angela Haynes said, though she felt guilty they were taking up so much of the important doctor’s time. 
Fakorede, who is on a personal mission to save people with diabetes from amputations, noticed what other doctors had missed. Haynes had blockages in blood vessels on both legs. 
Once he got the blood flowing again, Haynes began to feel better. His flesh returned to its normal color. The wound started healing at last. Walking became easier.
Then disaster struck again. 
On July 2, 2022, Haynes caught COVID-19. "Everything went downhill after that," he said.
During his 13-day illness, the bacteria in his foot raged out of control. He ended up back in the hospital and unable to withstand the long drive to Fakorede’s office.
Every week, a surgeon would come to the door of his hospital room and before even stepping all the way in ask Haynes whether he had decided to get his leg amputated. 
"This is my leg. I was born with this. And you're walking in like you're cutting a piece of cake," Haynes said.
He was worried about how he’d get around, how he’d be able to work to support his family if he had only one leg. No one took the time to explain why they thought the leg needed to come off or how he’d cope without it, Haynes said. 
In late November, he was finally sent home in a wheelchair. But just three weeks later, as he was getting out of the car after wound care, his right leg gave out and he fell to the ground. Back at the hospital, Haynes was told his foot was broken, essentially beyond repair. He agreed to a below-the-knee amputation.
Released right before Christmas, he spent the next three weeks in bed wondering how he’d manage the rest of his life.
Finally, it looked as if his luck might be turning around.
With the leg gone, his diabetes improved. His blood sugar dropped into the 120s or one-teens. His blurry vision cleared up.
During his long hospital stay, he befriended nurses and learned about a program for people who needed prostheses. The man who ran it called early in the year and said he had received a donated leg. If it fit Haynes, he could have it while waiting for insurance to pay for a personalized one. Miraculously, it did. 
Haynes spent the next six months teaching himself to walk again. The donor leg was heavy and uncomfortable. He wasn't mobile enough to hold down a job.
One late spring night, picking up dinner at a nearby restaurant, he headed to the bathroom for a pit stop. A sink had been leaking all day and Haynes slipped in the puddle, falling backward.
He's still recovering from the resulting wrist surgery.
He and Angela are living – barely – off her part-time salary as a secretary and a church organist.
Haynes has tried "at least three or four times" to receive government assistance, but they keep losing his paperwork, or not believing he's disabled, though he once checked himself out of the hospital and arrived at an appointment in his wheelchair to prove he didn't have a leg.
Still, he clings to his faith and the positive attitude he has long used to cheer up himself and others. These are his secret weapons against diabetes and everything else life throws his way.
"I try to put a smile on other people's faces," he said. "It keeps my day going."

Since the Israeli military ordered civilians to flee Gaza as it pursues Hamas militants, more than 1 million Palestinians have left their homes in the face of mounting airstrikes.
Vehicles carrying relief supplies stood motionless at Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip this week while locals and aid organizations begged for food, water and fuel for generators. They said the tiny territory sealed off by Israel after last week’s rampage by Hamas was near total collapse.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who had been forced from their homes were searching for bread. Hospitals in Gaza were on the brink of power outages, endangering the lives of thousands of patients. As an Israeli ground invasion seemed a certainty, Hamas militants continued their relentless rocket fire, and tensions grew along the Israel-Lebanon border to the north.
The Gaza power plant and power cables from Israel, which were Gaza's two primary suppliers of electricity, are no longer operational. At the beginning of the siege, Israel cut off its supply of electricity to the city, and the power plant ceased operations almost a week ago because of a shortage of fuel.

On Oct. 11, the Gaza Power Plant in Deir al-Balah, immediately south of the evacuation area, closed for lack of fuel. And with the suspension of Israeli supplies, Gaza is now without energy. 
Hospitals and other large facilities have backup generators, but when the fuel runs out, Israel's blockade will prevent new supplies from coming in.
Hospitals in Gaza "risk turning into morgues" without electricity, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The death toll on both sides has surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five wars involving the narrow, densely populated strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.

A key border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened Saturday to allow the first humanitarian aid to reach the besieged territory since the latest war between Israel and Hamas began.
Two weeks after the militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack in southern Israel and the country responded by sealing off and shelling the Gaza Strip where Hamas rules, a 20-truck convoy entered Gaza carrying desperately needed supplies.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is catastrophic, international groups have warned, as Palestinians are rationing food, drinking dirty water and hospitals are overwhelmed with injured and running low on supplies.
Two trucks that entered Gaza from Egypt are carrying over 44,000 bottles of drinking water from the U.N. children's agency – a day's supply for 22,000 people, according to UNICEF.
Israel continues to launch strikes into Gaza that have leveled neighborhoods, and has warned of a coming ground invasion. About half of the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians have fled their homes. Gaza officials say Israel's strikes have killed over 4,000 people. In Israel, more than 1,400 people have died — mostly civilians who died during the Hamas incursion.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the first aid delivery but said more is needed, and said Hamas must not steal the aid or prevent it from getting to civilians who need it.
“With this convoy, the international community is beginning to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza that has left residents of Gaza without access to sufficient food, water, medical care, and safe shelter," Blinken said in a statement. "We urge all parties to keep the Rafah crossing open to enable the continued movement of aid that is imperative to the welfare of the people of Gaza."
Aid groups say the supplies let in Saturday are not nearly enough, and more than 200 trucks carrying roughly 3,000 tons of aid have been positioned near the crossing for days. The amount of supplies entering Gaza Saturday pales in comparison to what was routinely sent into the occupied territory on a daily basis before the war started, Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program, told The Associated Press.
“We need many, many, many more trucks and a continual flow of aid," she said, noting about 400 trucks used to enter Gaza daily.
Israel had previously said nothing would enter Gaza until Hamas released the over 200 hostages taken during its rampage two weeks ago. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said aid would be delivered only to southern Gaza, where the army has ordered people to relocate, adding that no fuel would enter the territory.
The opening of the border came hours after officials announced Hamas had released an American woman and her teenage daughter, who were taken captive while visiting Israel. It wasn't clear if the release of the hostages and the delivery of aid to Gaza were related.
Latest developments:
∎ The explosion at Gaza’s al-Ahli Arab Hospital on Tuesday that U.S. officials estimate killed between 100 and 300 people was likely caused by the breaking up of a rocket that was fired from within Palestinian territory, an analysis by the Associated Press concluded.
∎ Fighting has intensified along Israel's border with Lebanon, with Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters exchanging fire Saturday in several areas along the border.
∎ Former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, a child of Palestinian and Syrian immigrants, said Friday that several of his relatives died at Saint Porphyrios Orthodox Church where they had been sheltering when an Israeli airstrike hit late Thursday. Israel acknowledged the blast and said the church wasn't its intended target.
Two Americans, Judith Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie, were released Friday after being held captive by Hamas for nearly two weeks, officials said.
They were the first hostages released by the militant group, which took some 200 people captive in its rampage in southern Israel on Oct. 7. They were in the hands of the Israeli military after being released, and Hamas said it released them for humanitarian reasons in an agreement with the Qatari government.
Judith and Natalie Raanan had been visiting Israel from their home of Chicago to celebrate Jewish holidays and were in the kibbutz of Nahal Oz, near Gaza, when the attack began, the family said. Their family hadn't heard from them since the attack.
President Joe Biden spoke with the mother and daughter Friday.
Meir Hecht, a rabbi in Evanston, Illinois, told USA TODAY earlier this week that Judith worked in health care and was a bright, kind and involved member of the community. Her teen daughter recently graduated from Deerfield High School and loved art and animals, he said.
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, and several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for the establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material, and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.

An Oct. 18 Facebook post (direct link, archive link) claims a major news outlet reported an American weapon was used in a fatal blast at a Gaza hospital on Oct. 17.
“The Wall Street Journal: The bomb dropped on the hospital was an American MK-84 bomb,” reads part of the post.
It was shared more than 800 times in two days. Other versions of the claim were shared widely on Instagram and X, formerly known as Twitter.

There is no reference to an MK-84 bomb in the Wall Street Journal’s reporting on the hospital blast. A company spokesperson said the claim is false. 
The outlet told USA TODAY the claim is false. 
“The Wall Street Journal has not reported that an American MK-84 was deployed in the Gaza hospital blast Tuesday,” a company spokesperson said. 
The outlet’s various stories on the incident make no mention of an American MK-84 bomb being used. Rather, they highlight the dueling narratives from Israel and Hamas, each assigning blame to the other party. 
Fact check: Photo of deceased children is from Syria in 2013, not Israel-Hamas war
Palestinian and Arab officials claimed an Israeli airstrike caused the fatal explosion, while Israel blamed it on a misfired rocket launched by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, according to the outlet. The U.S. government has also said preliminary evidence suggests Israel was not behind the explosion. 
The U.S. has sent munitions to Israel since Hamas' surprise attack on Oct. 7. They include small-diameter bombs, interceptor missiles for Israel's Iron Dome defense system and artillery shells, according to the Department of Defense and the Associated Press.
USA TODAY has debunked an array of false claims surrounding the Israel-Hamas war, including that Hamas surrendered and Gaza now belongs to Israel, that video shows President Joe Biden announcing the reinstatement of the draft, and that University of Pennsylvania students chanted “We want Jewish genocide” at a pro-Palestinian protest. 
The Associated Press and PolitiFact also debunked the claim.

FORT DODGE, Iowa — Allison Roderick has a warning and a pledge for rural residents of her county: The water from their wells could be contaminated, but the government can help make it safe.
Roderick is the environmental health officer for Webster County in north-central Iowa, where a few thousand rural residents live among sprawling corn and soybean fields. Many draw their water from private wells, which are exempt from most federal testing and purity regulations. Roderick spreads the word that they aren’t exempt from danger.

FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. – Desmond Ridder was the picture of NFL growing pains as he talked about turning the page on a disastrous ending last weekend while, well, looking ahead to a chance to make a claim on first place.
Ridder, the green Atlanta Falcons quarterback, is coming off the first three-interception game of his young NFL career. That left a lot of explaining for his media session before Wednesday’s practice.
"You try to obviously learn from the mistakes that were made … but you don’t dwell on those interceptions," said Ridder, whose next chance to make amends comes on Sunday at Tampa Bay (3-2) in a matchup that will determine the lead in the NFC South.
Survive long enough as an NFL quarterback and there will be weeks like this. Heat like this, with hot-take analysts suggesting the quarterback take a seat on the bench. The Falcons (3-3) lost an eight-point game against Washington after two of their final three drives ended with picks by the second-year quarterback. The other possession was rather ugly, too; the ball was turned over on downs that included a sack and two incompletions.
Talking turnovers, Ridder, 24, insisted there wasn’t a connecting thread. Was it accuracy or the play design? Bad decisions or bad routes?
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
"There were a couple things on each, where I could’ve made a better read, we could’ve ran a better route, or miscommunication," he said. "Or all three. So, there’s little parts in that entire game – not only with myself but with the whole offense. It’s got to be all 11 guys working on the same page."
In rolling with a young quarterback, the Falcons knew there would be some turbulence along the way with this learning curve. Ridder is surrounded by a strong cast of supporting weapons including first-round picks Bijan Robinson, Kyle Pitts and Drake London. And the defense has improved, allowing them to stay in games.
Yet as natural as it is for the quarterback to attract scrutiny, the crunch-time meltdown on Sunday – which included glaring clock management issues on top of the picks – wasn’t all on Ridder. Arthur Smith, the Falcons coach and play-caller, has fingerprints on this, too.
The Falcons’ operational process during the final minutes was a mess. On at least three occasions, the play-clock nearly ran out as Ridder prepared to call for the snaps. Atlanta probably uses as many personnel packages as any team in the league, which can help create matchup advantages but also requires frequent substitutions. And the unit uses an extensive amount of pre-snap motion, which can also chew up time.
In any event, this stuck out as the issues piled up on Sunday. During one sequence, the flow was so sloppy that after Ridder spiked the football to kill the clock, the Falcons still had to use a timeout as the 25-second play-clock was about to expire.
Asked about the operational issues, Smith fired back with arithmetic.
"Two-thousand plays the last two years," Smith said. "Things happen. They are all different. I wouldn’t call that some catastrophic trend. Now they shouldn’t happen. But they’re all different, why they happened. You identify the problem. But you take three plays out of 2,360…"
But still. It’s what happened lately. The mishaps on Sunday came with the game on the line.
"We can play this game all day," defended Smith, in his third season at the helm. "What about Houston? What about New York?"
In Week 5, the Falcons used a 10-play, 56-yard drive to beat the Texans 21-19 with a Younghoe Koo field goal as time expired. In Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, they executed a 12-play, 66-yard drive for Koo’s game-winning field goal with just under a minute on the clock. The New York game referenced was Smith’s first victory as Falcons coach, in Week 3 in 2021, when his team beat the Giants as then-quarterback Matt Ryan directed a seven-play, 56-yard drive that culminated with a Koo field goal as time expired.
"We’ve won a lot of games handling those situations," Smith added. "Obviously, we didn’t do it last week. We’ve got to get it fixed. This isn’t a trend, a runaway story. Acknowledge what happened. Fix it…Those things happened. That’s not the only reason we lost the game."
Smith pointed to the turnovers, maintaining that NFL teams this season have won just 6% of the games when committing three turnovers.
"Go back to Houston, and those guys executed pretty damn good," Smith said.
Ridder didn’t dispute the mishaps with the operational flow, which typically include the process of getting the play-call from the sideline in addition to the substitutions. He summed it up as a matter of paying better attention to detail, yet he also acknowledged the challenges with communication….especially as the play-clock winds down.
"It makes you speed things up faster," Ridder said. "That’s something we don’t want to do. It goes back to communication. Everybody knowing where they’re supposed to be…just the details with those plays."
Two of Ridder’s teammates, Pitts and London, commended their quarterback for keeping a calm demeanor amid the late-game chaos.
"He’s even-keeled," Pitts said. "When stuff is getting out of control, that’s not when you want to crumble. He’s good at keeping his composure."
Now Ridder – and the rest of his unit – will have to prove capable of growing from the hard lessons.
It's possible the NFL has never looked cooler.
That was perfectly evident Sunday, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers became the most recent team to throw it back, breaking out their beloved – beloved? – "Creamsicle" uniforms for the first time since 2012. (The NFC South-leading Bucs even got into the spirit of the occasion, capsizing in a 20-6 loss to the Lions – very reminiscent of their feckless performances during a two-decade run in "Florida Orange" from 1976-96.)
But that throwback comeback will hardly be the last – and if you don’t already know what’s coming in Weeks 7 and 8, you’ll be thrilled to see other classic uniforms coming out of mothballs. Even better, some fresh fashion-forward alternates are also coming down the pike.
Naturally, not every team is successfully leveraging the new opportunities the league has afforded with the use of secondary helmets and alternate and/or retro color schemes. So let’s take this haberdashery interlude to do a deep dive on NFL couture and rank the alternate uniforms from best to worst:
Sunday night, y’all – Kelly Green (with silver pants and helmet wings) is finally back after Nike finally dialed in the color fabrication. The “Midnight Green” scheme that’s been synonymous with Jeffrey Lurie’s ownership is underappreciated, not to mention championship-certified. But Kelly should always be an option in Philly’s palette, and its 13-year absence has been far too lengthy. (And a nice unintended consequence? Using the Kelly helmets twice this season precludes the return of last year’s alternate black tops.)
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
So nice to see “Bucco Bruce” return after an 11-year hiatus. And it seems retro is here to stay – at least intermittently – moving forward, the Bucs claiming on their website: “Creamsicle is a link between past and present. Of heroes come and gone. On this bridge between eras, it’s up to all of us to pass the torch. This is not a throwback. It’s our heart and soul. The core of who we are.” Maybe that’s a bit much for a team that was so abjectly bad during their inaugural Creamsicle phase, but pretty cool the Buccaneers have embraced their history – and the two post-Bucco Lombardi Trophies have surely helped. And that leads to another point: Tampa’s new-ish all-pewter alternates are perhaps the most underrated uniform of the Color Rush ilk.
Tampa Bay's expansion brethren from 1976 will also be turning back the clock to their original silver, blue and green look – complete with the less-caffeinated Seahawk – in Week 8. Not since 2001, before the ‘Hawks moved into their current stadium, have we seen the unis made famous by Steve Largent, Cortez Kennedy, Kenny Easley and Curt Warner. It’s a very nice offset to the attention-grabbing highlighter-green alternates.
“Old gold,” black and white looks good in virtually any combination – aside from those regrettable gold jerseys they tried in 2002 – whether in a callback to the team’s earliest looks from the 1960s or the monochrome white or black combos utilized in the current era. But the Saints really hit a home run with the alternate black helmet introduced last year, one that featured their iconic fleur-de-lis logo in gold on the side with a stream of smaller ones in a tapering pattern down the center line – similar to the feathers used by the Seahawks.
They’re now 3-0 in the “White Bengal” presentation – which finally includes a white helmet – after it debuted last year and returned in Week 3 against the Rams. Spectacular. It will resurface for Week 13’s Monday nighter against Jacksonville, too … though not before we have to endure the return of the team’s additional orange jersey.
The white “Pat Patriot” helmet and its throwback kit – a callback to AFL royalty – blessedly reappeared last year, just in time to spruce up a team that’s gone with a pretty basic look … to include the basic product Bill Belichick and Co. are currently putting on the field.
The next time we seem them on the field – Week 8, following their bye – they won’t quite be evoking AFL royalty … but only because their famously glorious, “Luv Ya Blue” Houston Oilers look with the white helmet and Columbia Blue oil derrick didn’t come into existence until 1975 and was last featured by the Tennessee Oilers in 1998. But the Titans have finally gone back to their roots and will even be shoving it in the faces of their H-Town replacements, the Texans, in Week 15. "It's been a long time coming," said Hall of Fame Oilers QB Warren Moon, who also hopes the Titans will get to wear the jerseys in Houston someday in appreciation of those fans.
They finally came to their senses and brought back their slick J-E-T-S logo from the 1980s in the “Legacy White” package they’ve already used to honor the “New York Sack Exchange” twice this season – including opening night. You remember, when new QB Aaron Rodgers got the win in his glorious NYJ debut. Moving forward, boys, let’s continue catching up to the Giants by also adding a home green jersey to pair with the flashback Boeing-esque sigil. After that, let’s maybe consider an entirely radical logo – which actually incorporates the silhouette of a jet fighter – and slap that on your crowns while scrapping the dopey Stealth Black helmet introduced in 2022.
When it comes to the extra uniform – forgettable throwbacks or gray Color Rush – they’ve done alternate in pretty much the most forgettable ways. Until now. Make sure you see Week 8’s Monday night game at Ford Field, when the Lions will break out their new metallic “Honolulu Blue” helmets featuring their 1960s alternate logo plus two stripes – the display effectively a nice co-brand with Ford’s famous Mustang, another icon from the ‘60s. Very cool way to commemorate what’s already becoming a memorable season between the lines for the NFC North leaders, not to mention the franchise’s 90th year as the Lions.
You could argue – and I have – no club has better unis. Not only that, since moving back to LA and updating their closets in 2020, they’ve given themselves so many mix-and-match scenarios, in addition to the royal blue and navy (with corresponding helmet lightning bolt) Color Rush options. But as much as folks used to pine for their Powder Blue alternates – which have lost just a little luster in the current iteration – now it’d be nice if the Bolts could either bring back the royal helmet with sunshine-y lightning used in the Air Coryell days, or the navy buckets with white bolts rocked by Junior Seau, LaDainian Tomlinson and so many others. (For the record, love the navy and white.)
Let’s commend them for maximizing the use – three appearances this season – of the retro red helmets and original logo with the black, white and gold striping mix meant to honor both the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech. Wouldn’t mind occasionally seeing the classic falcon on the black helmets as a callback to the Deion Sanders days, but that can wait. At least we won’t be subject to those vile gradient alternate jerseys in 2023.
Little reason to mess with something that’s practically perfect, but their deviations work well. The “Steel Curtain” era throwbacks won’t pop off the screen, but the 1970s number font style is the giveaway. Pittsburgh’s all-black Dark Knight look is among the best alternates going – especially when you consider the mistake it would be to revive some of the club’s awful appearances from yesteryear, bumblebees, shoulder swatches and whatnot.
Sunday afternoon, they’re going to roll out their new “Indiana Nights” one-off for 2023. Couple of thoughts here. They’ve added black helmets because Indy fans allegedly demanded them, and they play into the nocturnal theme – fine … aside from the fact the Colts have zero prime-time games this year. Otherwise, this is fairly boss. The secondary logo – with the state of Indiana serving as the center of the “C” for Colts on the shoulder is a plus. But the “heather pattern” used for the blue-on-blue uniform – golfers will recognize it immediately – really distinguishes this get-up.
Never too far afield, their alternates provide truly nice subtleties. They reverted to the “Purple People Eaters” days while rocking "The Vikings Classic” in Week 1. And keep your eyes peeled for the perfectly pleasing and pristine purple-and-gold alternates.
It’s not quite as slick as the retro Jets, but Sunday night marked this season’s first usage of the block GIANTS logo – with the white Color Rush road treatment – Big Blue used for the final quarter of the 20th century. It will return twice more in 2023, both at home when the Giants can also sport their Lawrence Taylor-Bill Parcells era blue jerseys.
A shame they’re not donning their old-school look this week, perfectly timed to the 1972 team popping champagne as the last unbeatens (49ers, Eagles) of the 2023 season suffered their first setbacks. But the Fins will be kitted in their original unis in Week 8 and again in Week 16. (In the future, perhaps let’s consider a new dome with a watery, shimmery look for the aquatic mammals? Maybe?)
They’ll continue wearing the duds – with shaded jersey numbers – the 1994 Super Bowl champions made famous, sporting the red version twice this season and the white roadies once.
Their 2020 rebrand has aged fairly well so far – doesn’t hurt when you win the Super Bowl in your new threads. It’s also helped that they’ve deemphasized the “bone” jerseys and pants originally intended as their roadies to a more seldom-utilized alternative.
Let’s issue belated credit for this season’s very clean uniform reboot, the whites (with a new dash of silver) especially evocative of their long-gone days in St. Louis. The alternate all-blacks, plus helmet, that debuted in Week 5 still seem extraneous. But, fine, whatever. Cardinals can only be so badass.
Their latest rebrand has gone so well … that new ownership is already mulling yet another one. But the alternate black uniforms topped with the black lids are the least-objectionable aspect – the usage of the D.C. flag on the right shoulder (in burgundy and gold) and back of the helmet the deftest touch.
They're one of several old-school organizations that’s never embraced hindsight or foresight flair especially well. The green jerseys with gold numbers paired with green pants in recent years have been a marked step forward … but another could be taken with a fresh second helmet to top it off.
Never been a huge fan of their 1960s-era throwbacks, whether home or away – and they’ll sport both this season. In Monday night’s win, they topped it with their alternate white-shelled helmet adorned with the current star insignia. Meh.
They added a black helmet to the wardrobe last year and have evidently decided it would look better atop their “Panther Blue” jerseys than as part of a monochrome blackout. Low bar, but agreed … not that it’s likely to help them win a game.
What is it with 1995 feline expansion teams? Thankfully, the Jags are finding their way back from the black-and-gold, two-toned wilderness. But nothing inspiring, or especially objectionable, in their black and (mostly) teal look at present.
They’ve got multiple ways to mix and match their various (dark) colors, the best alternate the purple on purple with gold jersey numbers. The original logo Baltimore used from 1996 to ’98 was one of the busier ones in NFL history … and might be fun to break out periodically for nostalgic purposes – especially if we could see those ugly black pants with the fat white stripe from the days of Ravens yore.
The NFL’s youngest franchise is also the only one to never change its crest. Tradition – yay. But last year, the Texans really stepped out by adding a metallic “Battle Red” helmet to go with the alternate jerseys branded the same way. Yaaawn.
This ranking is more a penalty that they’re not doing more than interspersing the alternate red jersey and pants. Let’s mix that grazing bison from the AFL days into heavier rotation and work up another lid – meaning something more imaginative than just taking the red shells from the 1990s Super Bowl teams out of mothballs.
For years, pretty much everything they’ve touched has turned to horse scat. Extend that to their attempt at merging their history with an edgy look. This year’s “snowcapped” (read: white) helmets adorned with the Orange Crush and Elway-era D logo might have worked … if the Broncos had been able to wear all white instead of Color Rush orange. It just wound up looking like a … melted creamsicle? It returns in Week 16 if you were fortunate enough to miss it the first time.
Let’s acknowledge there isn't much to do historically for a franchise that opted for a hideous color scheme and no primary logo. And rolling out a “retro” white helmet based on a leather model from the 1950s … is something – though perhaps preferable to slapping the Keebler Elf on there, something only Ja’Marr Chase would fancy. While on some level we appreciate the Browns’ decades-long holdout on helmet symbology, couldn’t we bend that rule in the alternate space? Especially after the wicked subsidary logo they unveiled earlier this year with the input of fan votes?
A shame a franchise so steeped in a century-plus’ worth of tradition – which also means it probably shouldn’t be looking especially chic – looks like such jack… Sorry, looks like such jack-o'-lanterns in their orange jerseys and new orange helmets. Stick with the winged University of Michigan knockoffs – yes, the Bears briefly wore them first in the 1930s – and call it a day. Better yet, let’s wind back to the 1960s and occasionally re-adopt the white version of the familiar “C” logo and truly honor the late Dick Butkus and Gale Sayers.
In my most recent overarching uniform power rankings, their iconic look ranked No. 1. And, as expressed elsewhere, it’s sometimes foolish to mess with magnificence. But the Silver and Black are being ranked last here mostly to put them on notice while serving a complacency penalty. The white Color Rush and white throwback jersey (with silver numbers) they’ve utilized in recent years are totally ... fine. But there’s a real opportunity to take their sinister look to a new, Darth Vader-caliber level a few times a year. Black pants? Black helmets with a chrome Raiders shield? Seriously, Mark Davis, what are we waiting for here? Commit to uniform excellence!
Pulling on the red pants is as frisky as they get, so no alternates or throwbacks to assess. And a team based in K.C. has little reason to dust off its long-ago Dallas Texans roots. As far as anything in the pipeline? “I think we have a very distinct brand with the red and white, and I don’t anticipate steering away from that any time soon,” owner Clark Hunt revealed this year, saying he also wanted to honor the wishes of his later father – AFL and team founder Lamar Hunt – who wanted uniform continuity. Welp, it wins.

Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson will indeed undergo shoulder surgery that will end his rookie season after just four games. Team owner Jim Irsay made the announcement Wednesday.
The news doesn't come as a surprise after Irsay told ESPN on Monday that Richardson would "probably" miss the rest of the regular season, with surgery possible in the next week or so. Richardson suffered a reported Grade 3 AC joint sprain in his shoulder during a Week 5 win over the Tennessee Titans and was placed on injured reserve last week.
The No. 4 overall pick in April's NFL draft missed two games and left two others early as the Colts have gotten off to a 3-3 start.
"After consultation with our medical staff, Anthony, and those close to him, it has been determined that he will undergo surgery to repair his injured shoulder, which will end his season," Irsay said in a statement. "Anthony is a competitor, and we know how difficult and disappointing this is for him and our team.
"We collected several medical opinions and we felt this was the best course of action for his long-term health. We anticipate a full recovery and there is no doubt Anthony has a promising future."

In the meantime, veteran Gardner Minshew has taken over at quarterback. He threw for 329 yards on Sunday against Jacksonville, but committed four turnovers in a 37-20 loss. Third-year quarterback Sam Ehlinger, who started three games in 2022, becomes Minshew’s backup, and the Colts also have former Vikings third-rounder Kellen Mond on the practice squad.

CORALVILLE — U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, standing on the bed of a bright red truck, delivered a passionate defense of her votes opposing U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan's bid for House speaker — a high-profile break from the majority of House Republicans that she said spawned death threats against her.
“I am never going to quit fighting for Iowa, and I am never going to quit fighting for this country," Miller-Meeks yelled at her annual fundraiser event Friday night. "So if you think you can intimidate me, go … suck it up, buttercup!"
Washington, D.C., was gridlocked this week as House Republicans failed to elect a new speaker. The caucus nominated Jordan, an ultraconservative representative from Ohio.
In the first round of votes, Miller-Meeks and the other three members in Iowa's delegation cast their votes for Jordan — but holdouts from 20 Republicans tanked Jordan's bid. Miller-Meeks explained Friday that she voted to Jordan out of respect for a House rule that members vote on the floor for whoever gets the majority vote in a closed-door conference.
But, she told reporters, she had concerns about whether Jordan could unify the party, and she was worried about the looming threat of a government shutdown.
"I wanted assurances that Republican members of Congress were not going to be attacking other Republicans," Miller-Meeks said. "As soon as the vote was had in conference, and then, not two hours later, we had that coming out."
In the second round of votes on Wednesday, Miller-Meeks withdrew her support for Jordan. She cast her vote Wednesday for U.S. Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, a Republican who chairs the Appropriations Committee.
"Since my vote in support of Chairwoman Granger, I have received credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls," Miller-Meeks said in a statement Wednesday night. "The proper authorities have been notified and my office is cooperating fully."
On Friday, Jordan lost a third floor vote for speaker, with Iowa's delegation voting for him except for Miller-Meeks. Jordan then lost a secret ballot and withdrew his nomination.
Miller-Meeks did not mention the death threats specifically during her speech Friday, but she delivered a passionate defense of her Congressional record.
“I’m not a Democrat. I am a proud Republican," Miller-Meeks said. "Why do I want to get appropriations bills across? … It’s because every one of those appropriations bills has Republican priorities and Republican policies."
Miller-Meeks thanked her office staff for dealing with a "very stressful week." She anticipates House Republicans will successfully choose a speaker "next week."
"We had a vote for speaker, and then I had to rush here to make my own tailgate. And so, there are candidates who have thrown their name into the ring," Miller-Meeks told reporters. "I have told everybody I’m not doing anything until Sunday."

The latest guilty pleas from two key allies in Donald Trump's high-profile Georgia election interference case put new pressure on the former president and raise questions about whether his once-loyal associates may one day flip on him.
Two attorneys, Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell, pleaded guilty to related crimes this week and agreed to testify against other defendants. They had been charged with playing separate roles in an alleged multi-pronged conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Coming after a third defendant, Scott Hall, pleaded guilty in September, their deals bolster the weapons in prosecutors' toolbox, and may pressure other defendants to flip -- a move that would raise the legal stakes for Trump.
''Once you get a couple people pleading, it starts sort of an avalanche of pleas," said Chandelle Summer, a Georgia attorney who previously worked as both a prosecutor and public defender in the state.
In addition to agreeing to testify, Chesebro, Powell, and Hall will turn over relevant documents to the state of Georgia, and are prohibited from communicating with witnesses or defendants in the case.
Norman Eisen, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2020, said information from the three former Trump associates, could bolster the government's evidence in another pending Trump trial -- federal election meddling case, which is scheduled to start in March in Washington.
"Both Powell and Chesebro were unindicted co-conspirators in the federal case, so they're central to it," Eisen said. "It is ominous for the other defendants in the state or federal cases, above all Donald Trump."
Chesebro, an election lawyer, pleaded guilty Friday in the Fulton County Superior Court to a felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. Chesebro offers an inside view of the development of the scheme to recruit fake presidential electors to vote for Trump in states that President Joe Biden won.
Chesebro created and distributed false documents in Georgia and other states for people to submit to the National Archives and Congress posing as presidential electors, according to Daysha Young, the executive district attorney in Fulton County.
"The defendant provided detailed instructions to co-conspirators in Georgia and other states for creating and distributing these false documents," she said.
Chesebro's deal gets the prosecution closer to John Eastman, who around that time appears to have been in "constant communication" with Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump, said Melissa Redmon, a former Fulton County prosecutor who directs the University of Georgia School of Law's Prosecutorial Justice Program.
Those connections will help the state paint a picture for the jury of the false elector activity being ultimately motivated by a desire to make sure Trump retained the presidency "by any means necessary," Redmon said.
Sixteen co-defendants in the Georgia case, including Trump, Eastman and Giuliani, have pleaded not guilty.
Powell, an election lawyer who spread baseless claims of voter fraud, pleaded guilty Thursday to a half-dozen misdemeanors associated with tampering with election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia.
Legal experts said Powell's agreement to provide testimony could have a weighty impact on the wider case because she had significant dealings with Trump, Giuliani, and others.
Powell can also describe how co-defendants tried to overturn the 2020 election. She and Giuliani attended a raucous meeting at the White House with Trump, where they discussed having the military seize voting machines. Trump never acted on the proposal.
Hall, a bail bondsman who served as a go-between for several of the co-defendants, pleaded guilty in September to five misdemeanors dealing with interfering with election duties.
Hall helped SullivanStrickler employees tamper with the Coffee County equipment.
Hall also made multiple calls to co-defendants in the case. For example, Hall spoke with Jeffrey Clark, a former assistant attorney general, for more than an hour Jan. 2, 2021, according to the indictment.
Clark, who pleaded not guilty, is charged with drafting a letter of false statements about Justice Department concerns with the 2020 election, to be sent to Georgia officials. Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to sign or send the letter.
Hall also spoke repeatedly with co-defendants accused of trying to intimidate election workers to change their stories about what happened with ballot counting at State Farm Arena on election night 2020.
Although the pleas open up several months on McAfee's calendar that had been reserved for Powell and Chesebro's trial, Redmon said typically in Fulton County there are several steps involving pre-trial deadlines before a trial date is set in a case, and she doesn't expect to see a trial date for Trump soon.
Summer said McAfee would have to take the schedules for Trump's other criminal trials into account, as well as his attorneys' scheduling conflicts.
"Assuming he's acquitted in the DC case, I think then they'll probably specially set a trial for sometime after that, maybe the fall of 2024," she said.
Eisen suggested McAfee might aim to hold Trump's Georgia trial sooner.
"If Chesebro and Powell could get ready for trial on an accelerated basis, surely it's not too unreasonable for Trump and possibly other defendants to prepare themselves to face a jury in Atlanta at some point in the coming months," Eisen said.
EXETER, N.H. — GOP presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy is leaning on one major message in his pitch to New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary voters: the need to revive a common U.S. national identity. 
“We don’t have to be a nation in decline,” Ramaswamy said at a Republican presidential town hall hosted by the USA TODAY Network, comparing the U.S. to a teenager. “We are just a little young, going through our own version of adolescence, figuring out who we’re really going to be when we grow up.”  
Ramaswamy, who officially filed Wednesday to appear on the Granite State’s Republican primary ballot, argued that half the job of the next U.S. president is to lead the the country out of its ongoing culture wars. The other half, he suggested, will be to steer the policy agenda in Washington.
So what is the 38-year-old political newcomers vision for America's future? During the Exeter, New Hampshire town hall, Ramaswamy laid out his policy priorities to reduce the federal deficit, support Israel and counter China. Here's how his pitch impacts Americans across the country.  
If elected, Ramaswamy told voters that he plans to shut down some major U.S. federal agencies, including the Department of Education.  
"There are certain people, good people, in this race, that will favor incremental reform of the federal government and the bureaucracy," he said. "I'm not in that camp. I favor quantum leap change. I don't believe it is possible to incrementally reform agencies that have existed for a long time." 
Echoing a common Republican talking point, Ramaswamy argued that education decisions should be put in the hands of parents. He said he’d opt to send the department's $80 billion in funding back to taxpayers to “economically empower” them to choose a school for their children.  
“My view is we have a fourth branch of government that is unconstitutional,” Ramaswamy told voters. “The correct answer is shut it down and give the power and the money back to the people.” 
To reduce the $33 trillion in U.S. debt, Ramaswamy floated a zero-based budgeting approach.  
When drafting the annual federal budget, Ramaswamy said he’d “start with zero as the baseline and then ask what’s actually necessary,” rather than referring to the previous year’s budget as a jumping-off point.  
The same tactic was adopted by former President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s but was not found to reduce costs and was later abandoned by former President Ronald Reagan.  
With tensions rising in the war between Israel and Hamas, Ramaswamy last week defended Israel’s right to protect its homeland but cautioned that, as president, he would put American interests at the center of his foreign policy agenda. 
“We have to provide Israel with diplomatic support, munitions support as needed and further even provide them with intelligence sharing,” Ramaswamy told voters gathered at the Exeter town hall. 
Ramaswamy called for providing the support in a way that “avoids broader regional conflict in the Middle East.” The perspective is largely shaped by his views on prior U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
“The Taliban is still in charge in Afghanistan 20 years later and frankly (there is) a hostile anti-American regime in Iraq that's vulnerable to Iranian incursion,” Ramaswamy said. “That didn't advance American interests and we have to own up to that." 
On Ukraine’s war front with Russia, Ramaswamy expressed support for a “reasonable path to peace,” but did not define his views on what that might entail. Previously, the biotech entrepreneur has proposed allowing Russia to keep the Donbas region and requiring Ukraine to concede its attempts to join NATO. 
Describing Vladimir Putin as a “craven dictator,” Ramaswamy told voters in New Hampshire that “just because Russia is bad doesn’t mean Ukraine is good or perfect.” 
He called for reopening relations between the U.S. and Russia and said that such an alliance would help counter China.  
“Do I trust Putin? No. But I do trust him to follow his self-interest,” Ramaswamy told voters. “China’s top bet right now is that the U.S. won’t want to go to war with two allied superpowers at the same time. But if Russia’s no longer in China’s camp then Xi Jinping is going to actually have to think twice.” 
Other Republican presidential candidates have fiercely criticized Ramaswamy’s foreign policy stances. During a confrontation at the first GOP debate, for instance, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley admonished Ramaswamy for his inexperience.  
“You want to go and defund Israel, you want to give Taiwan to China. You want to go and give Ukraine to Russia,” she said. “Under your watch, you will make America less safe.” 
The House of Representatives heads into its third weekend without a Speaker as Ohio Republican Jim Jordan failed to win enough votes for the third time this week.
The third round of balloting for the Speaker's chair saw 25 Republicans vote against the party's Speaker Designate.
Following the floor vote, Jordan was defeated in an internal, secret ballot vote to decide if he would remain the nominee 112-86, as reported by USA Today's Ken Tran.
Multiple Republican Representatives have come forward to put their names into the race as Acting Speaker Patrick McHenry told reporters that the "goal" is to have the next Speaker election on the floor on Tuesday.

Two men visited New York Lottery headquarters to claim million-dollar prizes. One man matched five white balls on the Powerball, and another chose the right scratch-off to make him a millionaire.
Manuel Palaguachi of Hartsdale won $1 million after purchasing his ticket at Central Snack Mart located at 395 Central Ave. in White Plains. He matched the first five numbers in the historic July 19 Powerball drawing where someone from California won the $1.08 billion jackpot prize.
The winning numbers for that evening's drawing were 7, 10, 11, 13, 24; the Powerball number was 24.
After the necessary withholdings were calculated, Palaguachi was given a lump sum of $591,000 as payment.
Palaguachi claimed his prize on Thursday but wasn't the only one to do so. Abu Alam, from Woodside, New York used $5 to purchase the Bonus World Cashword instant game.
Alam scratched off 10 words on the card and won $1 million. He purchased his ticket at S Grocery in Jackson Heights.
"I felt like the King of Queens when I saw I won the game's top prize," Alam told the New York Lottery.
The New York Lottery is the largest and most profitable in North America, according to Lottery officials. It contributed $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2022-2023 to support public K-12 education in New York State.

It's understandable that some lottery players are enticed by the whopping $70 million jackpot, but it's essential to keep in mind that the chances of winning Powerball's top prize are exceedingly slim.
To participate in the Powerball game, players can purchase a ticket for $2 per play. The game requires players to choose five numbers from one to 69 for the white balls, and one number from one to 26 for the red Powerball. Alternatively, players can opt to receive random numbers.
In order to win the jackpot, it is necessary to match the numbers for all of the five white balls and the red Powerball.
In addition to the grand prize, Powerball offers eight other ways to win based on the number of matched balls in the non-jackpot tiers.
The non-jackpot prizes offered range from $4 to $1 million. By paying an additional $1, you can choose to participate in "Powerplay" that increases non-jackpot winnings by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 times.
According to Powerball, the 10X Powerplay option is exclusively applicable to jackpots worth $150 million or less. Additionally, the game's "Match 5" prize for the second-tier is limited to a maximum of $2 million if the Powerplay feature is utilized.
Tickets can be purchased in-person at gas stations, convenience stores and grocery stores. Some airport terminals may also sell lottery tickets.

A California man walked out of a store holding a $10 million lottery ticket, thanks to a clerk's recommendation after he couldn't decide which scratch-off ticket to buy.
Brent Young won his $10 million from the California 200X $30 instant game. He bought the winning ticket at Prince Food & Gas on West Walnut Avenue in Visalia.
Young had no idea which game would give him the best chance of winning. Feeling indecisive, he asked the clerk for help in picking a ticket. 
It can be challenging for players to choose from over two dozen scratch-off games the California Lottery offers. The clerk picked out a ticket from the $30 instant game California 200X.
After paying for his gas and lottery ticket, Young got to work scratching. As he was about halfway through, he noticed that one of his numbers matched the winning numbers printed on the side of the ticket. There was no mistaking it - the prize amount of $10,000,000 was printed in bold font.
"When I saw all those zeros, I was like, 'No way, this doesn't happen to people like me,'" Young told the Lottery. "It's crazy. Out of all those options, the clerk could have picked a different game, but he didn't. He grabbed a winner."
Young was surprised to find himself at this particular retailer. He typically purchased fuel and lottery tickets at a different gas station. However, on that day, the other gas station was closed, so he had to stop at Prince Food & Gas instead.
"It's almost like God's intervention," Young told the Lottery. "I didn't have a specific ticket I was going to buy, so I let someone else decide. I had no choice but to go to Prince's. My usual stop was closed. If it had been open, none of this probably would have happened."
After federal taxes, he chose to receive the $5.8 million lump sum prize, and the owner of Prince Food & Gas received a $50,000 bonus for selling the ticket.
California 200X is a California-exclusive instant game where players can win up to $10 million.
After Young won the top prize, four out of nine $10 million prizes remain in the $30 California 200X game. Additionally, nine out of 18 $750,000 second-tier prizes and 40 out of 92 $50,000 third-tier prizes, remain.

The overall odds of winning any prize in the game are 1 in 2.71. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 3,041,187.

Chick-fil-A has reportedly agreed to pay customers $4.4 million in rebates or gift cards to settle a class action suit filed against the chain for misleading delivery fees.
The Atlanta-headquartered company faced a suit filed earlier this month in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia alleging the company had been "deceptive and untruthful" in promising free or low-priced deliveries of orders via the Chick-fil-A app and website.
The six plaintiffs in the suit, two from Virginia and one each from Arkansas, Maryland, South Carolina and Texas, said the food chain added a "secret menu upcharge" for menu items being delivered that made the company's "promise of free or low-cost delivery patently false," according to the complaint.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the restaurant chain charged a $4.99 delivery fee, the suit alleges. But as the lockdown measures were issued early in the COVID shutdown, Chick-fil-A "claimed to reduce its delivery fee to FREE, $2.99 or $3.99," to boost business, the suit charges. At the same time, the company "secretly raised its menu prices on delivery orders only in order to cover the costs of delivery and profit – without once disclosing the manipulation to customers," according to the suit.
As a result, food prices on deliveries were 25% to 30% higher, the suit charges. An example in the suit: a 30-piece order of chicken nuggets would cost $5 to $6 more when ordered for delivery than when picked up or ordered at a restaurant.

Chick-fil-A did not admit guilt in the case but will create a $1.45 million cash fund and $2.95 million gift card fund for consumers, the website Top Class Actions reported.
Chick-fil-A and attorneys for the plaintiffs did not return USA TODAY's requests for comment.
An unspecified number of customers are expected to get either $29.25 in cash or a $29.25 gift card from Chick-fil-A as part of the settlement, the Top Class Actions site reported. If the settlement fund is not large enough to fund all claims, proportionate payments will be made, the site states.
Keep an eye on your inbox because those eligible for a reward will be notified by email. Chick-fil-A agreed to give the settlement administrator the email addresses needed to inform class members.
If you divide the total of $4.4 million by the proposed $29.25 settlement amount, there's a potential 150,427 affected customers.
As part of the settlement, Chick-fil-A will also put disclosures on its app and website stating that prices on menu items may be higher for delivery orders.
“Plaintiffs allege that by omitting, concealing, and misrepresenting material facts about (Chick-fil-A's) delivery service, (the company) deceives consumers into making online food purchases they otherwise would not make,” the Chick-fil-A settlement states.

While only 12.3% of U.S. adults meet the recommended fruit and vegetable intake, the grains group isn’t one that Americans have trouble getting enough of, MyPlate says. Grains show up in many parts of our day – cereals and bagels in the morning, sandwiches at lunchtime, rice at dinner or popcorn while watching a movie. 
But while the quantity may not be an issue, the quality is: the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends more of your grain intake be from whole grains than refined.
Here are the healthiest options within that whole grain category.
Grains are an important source of fiber, B vitamins, complex carbohydrates and minerals like iron, magnesium and selenium. The carbohydrates in grains are crucial because they’re “direct and easy sources of energy for your body” says registered dietitian Chris Mohr.
While all whole grains will provide these nutrients, there are a few that stand out. Farro, oats and quinoa may be the healthiest grains because of their heavy fiber content. 
“Fiber’s not the sexiest nutrient to talk about because of the benefits, but it’s critical for health,” Mohr says.
Dietary fiber helps you feel fuller, aids in digestion and helps prevent constipation. Research presented at the 2021 American Society for Nutrition conference found fewer than 1 in 10 U.S. adults meet their daily fiber recommendations. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating 28 grams of fiber per day based on a 2,000-calorie diet. 
You’re also getting protein with these three options. A serving of oats (100 grams) contains nearly 17 grams of protein and 10.6 grams of fiber. A serving of farro of the same size contains 15.4 grams of protein and 6.6 grams of fiber. For cooked quinoa, it’s about 3 grams of fiber and 4.4 grams of protein. 
For comparison’s sake, the same portion of white rice contains about 2.7 grams of protein and 0.4 grams of fiber.
But while these three are great options, Mohr says you ideally want to eat a variety of grains to get different nutrients.
The USDA recommends at least half your daily grain intake be whole grains, which contain more vitamins and nutrients than refined grains. Mohr says we shouldn’t be scared of refined grains but should make sure they’re enriched.
The refinement process gives grains a finer texture and longer shelf life – we see this in cereal, white flour, white bread and white rice, for example. Today, many refined grains are enriched, which means they add back nutrients like B vitamins and iron but not fiber. Enriched, refined grains do add folic acid, however, which Mohr says even whole grains don’t include as much of in their natural form.
Folic acid is recommended during pregnancy because of its role in DNA and RNA formation, but it’s important for everyone. The benefits of folate include improved digestive system functioning and preventing common cancers, cardiovascular disease, infertility, stroke, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
“That’s why it’s important to make sure that you are getting even some refined grains because they are enriched specifically with folic acid,” Mohr says. 
Check the packaging or nutrition labels to tell if a refined grain is enriched. Organic products may not be fortified. 
What is the healthiest bread?:One is best, but you've got plenty of options
To understand whole grains, you first have to understand grain kernel anatomy. The kernel is made of three parts:
Whole grains are just as they sound – the entire grain kernel remains intact. When you refine grains, it strips the grain of the bran and germ and uses just the inside endosperm. This removes most of the grain's vitamins, minerals, fiber and protein. 
It’s important to know how to look for whole grains when you’re grocery shopping. You can’t use a darker color as a judge, because breads and other grain products are sometimes dyed with molasses, according to Mohr. You have to look at the ingredient list.
“You want the words ‘whole grain’ to be at the beginning of the ingredient list,” he says. 
The easiest swap is to consciously add in more whole grain products to tip you over to that “more than half” whole grain recommendation. This could be trying whole grain bread instead of whole wheat or white bread, having brown rice or wild rice every once in a while if you normally eat white rice or looking for whole grain bagel options, Mohr says. 
Whole grain cereals can be another good addition to your mornings – routinely consuming ready-to-eat cereals, especially whole grain ones, is associated with significant increases in overall dietary fiber intake.
What foods are high in fiber?:Add these in to get enough

If you struggle with blemished or aging skin, or from a skin condition such as acne, chances are you've tried many natural remedies to help. These may have included apple cider vinegar, vitamin supplements, essential oils or even a viral honey and cinnamon mask you may have seen trending on social media. 
But chances are, you've also turned to prescription and over-the-counter medications or topical applications in an attempt to find a solution. While there are many products offered by the $146-billion-dollar skin-care industry which include vitamin C serum and a host of lotions and creams, few such products or ingredients are more sought after than retinol. 
Retinol is a form of the fat-soluble nutrient vitamin A, and is a popular ingredient in skin cream topicals for its anti-aging effects. It's a type of retinoid - chemical compounds derived from vitamin A or chemically related to it - but is unique in that most retinoids are considered powerful enough to require a prescription while the retinol formula is mild enough to be available in over-the-counter form.
"Retinol is most commonly applied topically and only a small amount is needed," explains Dustin Portela, DO, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Treasure Valley Dermatology in Boise, Idaho. "To my patients, I recommend using a pea-size amount of cream or gel, or about four drops of the serum, to cover the whole face." 
Though retinol is mainly used as a lotion, cream, gel or serum, retinol-related medications can be taken orally as well to treat skin conditions and to help "prevent skin cancers in patients at higher risk of skin malignancies," says Anna Chien, MD, a board-certified dermatologist practicing in Columbia, Maryland, and an associate professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
Retinol is effective in a number of ways. It can unclog pores (and thereby improve acne), neutralize free radicals and exfoliate one's skin. "Retinol acts inside your skin cells on several different molecular pathways to help improve the skin's appearance," explains Portela. In this way, he says it can help boost collagen production and also minimize wrinkles and fine lines. 
Chien says that retinol can also improve skin turnover, decrease the size of sebaceous glands (glands found in hair follicles that secrete the oily substance sebum), even out pigmentation, decrease skin proliferation, improve skin texture and protect against signs of aging. Because of such varied functions, "it's used topically for acne, skin aging, discoloration and for certain skin diseases such as psoriasis," she says. 
While many people reap such benefits without experiencing side effects, "retinol does come with some risks," says Portela. He says the most common one is irritation of the skin. "It can disrupt the moisture barrier if you use too much or too strong of a retinol for your skin type," he cautions. 
Another area of concern is that it's possible for retinol to increase one's sensitivity to the sun. Because of this, "it is especially important to wear a daily sunscreen if you have incorporated retinol into your skin care routine," Portela advises. Retinol is also not generally recommended for use while pregnant.
When it comes to decreasing retinol's side effects related to skin irritation, Chien says that can "be managed with careful titration of its usage (combined with) a gentle skin care routine." 
Acne treatments abound but what work?An expert gets into skincare essentials
As economic and environmental factors have contributed to rising stress levels, many Americans are turning to conventional therapies for help. Common treatments for stress include getting better sleep, breathing exercises, rebalancing work and home life, and spending more time outdoors.
Others find that the food and nutrients they put into their bodies can be helpful. Foods like fish, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats, for example, have been known to reduce stress. Another plant-based product known for its stress-relieving properties is ashwagandha. "Ashwagandha has been shown to help reduce stress, anxiety, and improve brain function," says Julia Zumpano, RD, registered dietitian at Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition.
Ashwagandha, also known as withania somnifera, Indian ginseng, or winter cherry, is an evergreen shrub found in India, the Middle East and parts of Africa. "It is mostly used in the form of a supplement − as a capsule, powder or liquid extract," says Uma Naidoo, MD, director of nutritional and lifestyle psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and the author of “This is Your Brain on Food."
Ashwagandha has been used for thousands of years and is praised in research from the African Journal of Traditional, Complementary, and Alternative Medicine as one of the most important and widely benefiting herbs of Ayurveda − the traditional system of medicine in India. "It is not surprising that this botanical has health benefits," says Carol Johnston, PhD, RD, a professor of nutrition at Arizona State University. "Plants produce highly sophisticated compounds to protect them from environmental insults and many of these protective properties extend to human tissues when ingested." 
Ginseng: What is the ancient herb and should you take it? Understand it, first.
Some of the benefits that come from ingesting ashwagandha include "boosted energy levels, anxiety treatment, enhanced focus and reduced stress," says Josh Redd, NMD, the founder of RedRiver Health and Wellness and author of "The Truth About Low Thyroid." Indeed, ashwagandha has been classified as an adaptogen − a natural substance that helps the body cope with stress. Research shows ashwagandha works to reduce stress, in part, because the herb reduces activity in one's HPA axis − the part of the brain in charge of regulating stress response. 
Naidoo says ashwagandha may also aid those struggling with poor sleep, memory issues or arthritis; and it may also be helpful against type-2 diabetes because it helps lower blood sugar levels in people with insulin resistance. 
Zumpano says ashwagandha is also sometimes recommended to help men with testosterone levels or fertility issues, though supporting research is still ongoing.
While "small to moderate doses of ashwagandha are considered safe," says Zumpano, "large doses have reported side effects." These include gastrointestinal distress such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. The herb is a nightshade that belongs to the same vegetable family as tomatoes, potatoes, peppers and eggplants, explains Redd; "and some people with autoimmune diseases find that nightshades flare up their system."  
Pregnant women is another group that Naidoo recommends "should be cautious about taking ashwagandha. Always speak to your health-care provider first."

Infertility or reduced fertility is a common problem in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 out of 5 women are unable to get pregnant after a year of trying − the standard definition for infertility. 
Other common reproductive disorders that affect women include menstrual problems like irregular or heavy bleeding and a number of conditions such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis and sexually transmitted diseases.
When it comes to improving one's reproductive health, few things matter more than estrogen. 
Along with progesterone, "estrogen is one of two hormones secreted by the ovaries," says Andrew Greenberg, MD, director of the obesity and metabolism lab at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Hormones are chemical messengers that travel through the bloodstream to trigger specific functions or feelings throughout the body. 
Sometimes also called ovarian estrogen, the secretion of estrogen "begins around the time of puberty" and continues throughout reproductive life − "puberty to menopause," says Cynthia Stuenkel, MD, a clinical professor of medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. She explains that most women experience monthly cycling of estrogen and progesterone, "which matures the lining of the uterus in preparation for pregnancy should fertilization of the egg by a sperm occur." This ebb and tide of hormonal secretion by the ovary and monthly bleeding "becomes a familiar rhythm to most women," she adds. 
What is perimenopause?Experts explain the typical age and symptoms to expect.
Along with being secreted by the ovaries, the hormone is "produced in a female's adrenal glands and fat tissue," says Disha Narang, MD, an endocrinologist at Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital. And though significantly higher amounts of estrogen are produced and present in women, men also have the hormone as well. In males, estrogen is produced in the testes and, similar to women, in fat cells and adrenal glands. 
In addition to its fundamental roles in reproductive health and menstrual cycle regulation, estrogen also affects the female urinary tract, reproductive tract, bones, breasts, skin, hair, mucous membranes, pelvic muscles and the brain, per Johns Hopkins Medicine.
Other important functions or benefits of estrogen include a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease before menopause, a reduced risk of developing abdominal obesity, and reduced vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary symptoms during perimenopause −"a period of time before women fully enter menopause," explains Greenberg.
In men, estrogen helps with sexual development, improved bone strength and muscle mass, and contributes to a healthy metabolism. 
Because estrogen plays so many vital roles in the body, it's important to maintain healthy levels of the hormone. In both males and females, low estrogen levels can affect "libido, cholesterol, metabolism, brain function, bone health and skin health," says Narang.
More:Have we been thinking about 'sex drive' all wrong?
To prevent low levels of estrogen production, good eating habits are a wise place to start since dietary choices significantly affect hormone balance. Reduced consumption of sugar-filled foods and getting plenty of foods high in fiber can help in this regard. Reducing one's stress through practices like mindfulness meditation and exercise can also be beneficial since high-stress levels are associated with hormone imbalances. Quality and quantity of sleep is also important. 
If estrogen levels drop too low, a physician may recommend estrogen supplementation or a form of estrogen therapy.
Lawyers all over the state of Tennessee are scratching their heads about the Michael Oher conservatorship and the ensuing litigation.
On Aug. 9, 2004, a lawyer in Hernando, Mississippi, filed a petition on behalf of Sean Tuohy and his wife, Leigh Anne Tuohy, to be appointed conservators over Michael Oher (the “Respondent”). The petition states that the court should grant the Tuohys “full co-legal custody, guardianship and conservatorship” over Oher.
Although the petition asks that the Tuohys be named conservators over “the person” of Oher, which would mean they would have the power to make decisions about healthcare, they also requested that Oher not be allowed to enter into any contracts on his own behalf.
The petition goes on to say that Michael Oher “has no known physical of psychological disabilities.” The petition is signed by the Tuohys, by Oher’s mother and by Oher.
Three months later, without any further pleadings being filed, the judge awarded the Tuohys the ability to make all medical decisions for Oher. His right to enter into contracts was also taken away and given to the Tuohys.
For the next 19 years, the court never required any proof of disability nor did the court require accountings or annual status reports.
This is not how the law of conservatorship works in Tennessee. A court is required to find by clear and convincing evidence, based at least in part on the report of a physician, that the respondent is fully or partially disabled and that he or she is in need of assistance from the court. Rights are then removed from the respondent and vested in the conservator.
Conservatorship system devours dignity:After Britney Spears' abusive conservatorship, don't reform the system – abolish it
There is no “custody” or adoption proceeding that goes along with a conservatorship. The Tuohys could have adopted Oher, even though he had reached 18 years of age. An adoption, however, is fundamentally different than conservatorships and does not remove any rights from a child.
Under Tennessee law, conservators are required to file an accounting and a status report once a year. No accountings or status reports were ever filed in the Oher case.
In August, 2023, 19 years later, Michael Oher filed his own petition to terminate the conservatorship and require the Tuohys to account to him.
The Tuohys have filed an answer. They claim that they never told Oher that they were going to adopt him and that their sole motivation in pursuing the conservatorship was to enable Oher to play for the University of Mississippi (“Ole Miss”), which would have been forbidden under NCAA recruiting rules if they were supporting Oher and he was not a part of their family. They state that they referred to Oher as a son, felt that he was like a son, and “have used that on occasion but not in the legal sense.”
Prison reform gives second chance:First Step Act advanced prison reform, but hundreds are still serving unjust sentences
My very limited research shows that the Tuohys have a book on Amazon for which they are listed as co-authors and which is called: “In a Heartbeat:  Sharing the Power of Cheerful Giving.”  The description of the book refers to the “remarkable couple depicted in ‘The Blind Side’” and the “story of Michael Oher and the family who adopted him.”
The judge over the Oher case in Memphis, Kathleen N. Gomes, entered an order at the end of September terminating the conservatorship but retaining the other issues, i.e., Oher’s action for accountings and damages.
More will be revealed as this lawsuit progresses, but the case is disturbing. An 18-year-old could be confused by the language of the original petition which refers to guardianship and custody along with conservatorship. Moreover, the Tuohys seem to have profited from the story about adopting Oher in many ways, only one of which may have been financial.

“In what kind of case do you think it would be appropriate for a criminal defendant to call the prosecutor a thug and stay on the streets?” U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan asked Donald Trump's attorney John Lauro on Monday during a hearing on whether the former president’s speech should be restricted. 
Lauro didn’t provide the correct answer, which is this: all of them. 
Although it doesn’t appear to be a common occurrence – there’s only one published instance where a defendant allegedly admitted to calling the U.S. attorney assigned to his case names – this happens often enough. Criminal defendants have just as much disdain for prosecutors as the prosecutors have for them. Their displeasure is expressed outside of court. The only difference with Trump’s calling special counsel Jack Smith a thug is that no one was listening when these other defendants insulted their prosecutors. 
Talking smack is part of the game. To suggest that it doesn’t happen is not only disingenuous on Judge Chutkan’s part, it’s also a misunderstanding of the importance of the defendant’s voice in criminal cases – one that could prove unconstitutional. It’s almost like the former public defender doesn’t understand defense.
A defendant’s rights may be in tension with the First Amendment rights of the news media, but that’s not what’s happening with the former president. This isn’t even a situation where a lawyer’s speech is restrained. That has happened in the past on occasion, such as the gag order in the trial of the Los Angeles police officers accused of beating Rodney King. Those are the two situations that courts have reviewed in the past, but telling a defendant he can’t speak is unprecedented.
In the federal election conspiracy case against Trump – he could be facing 55 years in prison if convicted and sentenced to the maximum on each of the four conspiracy and obstruction charges – what Chutkan did was the inverse of a Fifth Amendment violation.
If the judge had compelled Trump to speak somehow, that would be a clear violation of his right not to incriminate himself – namely, to keep himself un-convicted and free. Yet, when he wants to say something that he thinks would keep himself un-convicted and free, she’s stepping on that right. 
Judge issues partial gag order:Trump, who never shuts up, now has a gag order to whine about. And you know he will.
While for some it might be wise not to testify in one’s own defense, some studies suggest an acquittal is more likely when a defendant tells their story.  
Even if taking the witness stand in one’s own criminal case is ill-advised, defendants can't legally be stopped from speaking to protect themselves. The Supreme Court has held that preventing someone from testifying in court in a case against themselves violates the due process clause of the 14th Amendment and the compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment.
There have been very few studies of the First Amendment’s role in criminal courtrooms. One, authored by George Washington University Law School professor Daniel Solove, examines the ways that the First Amendment operates with the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and how government searches of suspects’ intellectual property deserves more attention.
In the article, Solove argued that the First Amendment doesn’t get enough consideration in criminal courtrooms but, notably, doesn’t even mention a case of a court telling a defendant not to speak. It’s practically unthinkable. 
Because criminal cases threaten an individual’s freedom and possibly life, courts have to give a defendant more leeway in speech. That’s why in People v. O.J. Simpson, there were no gag orders in the criminal case under former Superior Court Judge Lance Ito – Ito floated the idea but never followed through on it.
However, the judge assigned to the subsequent civil case filed by Ron Goldman’s family restricted speech of the parties in what has been called a “sweeping” order. All that was at stake in those civil proceedings was civil liability – i.e., money.  
Chutkan’s – and the public’s – inability to equalize the First and Fifth Amendments as they pertain to criminal defendants shows just how hard it is to convince people that every accused person is innocent – until they’re convicted and they may be actually innocent after that, too. If there’s a defense to be made, there’s no reason why the defendant shouldn’t be able to speak it. In fact, for people whose freedom is jeopardized, the right to speak becomes even more important. 
Don't obstruct sentencing reform:First Step Act advanced prison reform, but hundreds are still serving unjust sentences
The judge was correct when she said that the former president “does not have the right to say and do exactly what he pleases.” He doesn’t. He can’t threaten people. 
And laws exist to cover that. They’re in the criminal code of every state and the federal government, and if law enforcement thinks Trump violated those statutes then he should be charged as anyone else would be. 
The constitutional fallout of Chutkan’s partial gag order is yet to be seen; Trump has said that he’ll appeal it before the case is over.
Stopping him from speaking is stopping him from defending himself, and that’s something no judge presiding over a criminal case should ever be allowed to do.

Death threats. Intimidation. Family members called out by strangers.
A number of House Republicans who refuse to support right-wing Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker are suddenly learning the true language of Donald Trump’s MAGA movement, a movement they have either tolerated or nurtured for years. While MAGA fury is usually directed at liberals, this time it's hitting him like unfriendly fire.
Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, after voting against Jordan, said he received an email that read: “Go f--- yourself and die if I see your face, I will whip all the hair out of your f---ing head you f---ing scumbag.”
Rep. Drew Ferguson of Georgia said in a statement that after voting against Jordan, his family started receiving death threats: "That is simply unacceptable, unforgivable, and will never be tolerated.”
Axios reported that Ferguson told other House Republicans in a Thursday meeting “that he’s had to have a sheriff stationed at his daughter’s school over death threats from the far right. Also one at his house.”
The New York Times reported that the wife of Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska "has begun sleeping with a loaded gun after receiving increasingly menacing anonymous calls and texts.”
Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado said Thursday: “I've had four death threats. I've been evicted from my office in Colorado … because the landlord is mad with my voting record on the speaker issue, and everybody in the conference is getting this. ... Family members have been approached and threatened.”
This behavior is horrible and unacceptable. It’s also entirely predictable to anyone who has paid attention to a political movement forged in violent rhetoric and seemingly driven by the destruction of social and political norms.
Just recently, Trump has suggested that a top U.S. general be executed, mocked the violent hammer attack on a Democratic lawmaker’s husband and talked about shooting shoplifters.
Election conspiracy theorist flips:Sidney Powell pleads guilty to election interference, releasing the Kraken on Donald Trump
In March, he railed against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s hush money investigation on Truth Social, warning of “potential death & destruction” if he is charged and calling Bragg “a degenerate psychopath.”
Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a New York University historian, told The Associated Press: “Violence is his political project now. It is the thing, besides his own victimhood, that he brings up the most.”
Like their avatar, Trump loyalists often lean into bullying and threats, enamored with flexing a faux toughness that comes easy when anonymous emails and social media accounts protect them from consequences.
When Jordan became a House speaker candidate, he quickly got Trump’s blessing and the extended MAGA universe rose up, excited to see one of their own get a shot at running the show.
Steve Bannon, a former Trump White House adviser and human embodiment of the phrase “all hat, no cattle,” ordered his Trump-obsessed podcast listeners to go after Republican holdouts: “Call them and get in their grill. Let them know what you think … Email, call their local office, all of it, burn it down. That's right. Get up in their face.”
And so they did. And it backfired, because these Republicans finally got a close look at the kind of folks they’ve been pandering to and thought, “Yikes, these people are scary. I don’t want to support this!”
That's to their credit. Fear of the MAGA base is a big reason so many Republican lawmakers have remained loyal to Trump through an insurrection and a slew of indictments. Bucking that trend, in today's chaotic and unraveling Republican Party, is downright courageous.
Jim Jordan fails again.GOP should consider using this House speaker job post on LinkedIn.
Jordan responded to the threats by putting out a statement on social media Wednesday saying, “We condemn all threats against our colleagues.”
But that has always been Trump and the broader MAGA movement’s game. Say outrageous things and then, when those statements spark chaos or violent threats, pretend that was never the point.
Of course it’s the point. It has always been the point, ever since Trump first bullied his way onto the political scene and cowed so-called normal Republicans with veiled threats and truckloads of red meat to throw at a base right-wing talk radio and television spent years priming for violence.
We saw it all culminate at the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
Plenty of folks critical of Trump have dealt with threats and bullying over the years, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, Republican, Democrat or otherwise. But it seems a bit remarkable that so-called moderate Republicans who’ve watched all this happen, who’ve offered either full-throated or tacit support for Trump because it was in their own political interest, now need a fainting couch because the MAGA monster is attacking them.
This is your monster, Republicans. You brought this beast to life by tolerating an unmoored narcissist. You let it grow and gave it permission to lash out in all directions.
And I bet if the presidential election were tomorrow and I asked you who you’re supporting, you’d utter these two ridiculous words: Donald Trump.
Some never learn. If you put up with a dog that bites strangers, you can’t be surprised when it sinks its teeth into you.

“People throw rocks at things that shine.” 
That lyric flashed through my head as I read a recent opinion column claiming that Taylor Swift “has yet to make a significant mark as a philanthropist,” and that her estimated $4 billion Eras Tour earnings are a chance for the singer to champion left-leaning causes in honor of her fans.
As Swifties know, though, this dismissive characterization of the 12-time Grammy Award winner’s charitable giving is anything but perfectly fine. Swift has a mind of her own, and she’s not afraid to use it. Her approach to philanthropy is no exception.
Map out Swift’s philanthropy and one finds the singer’s empathetic approach to giving is deeply personal and powerful, transcending political divides. That includes her support of friends, cancer patients, sexual assault survivors, disaster relief organizations and food banks along her Eras Tour. The list goes on. 
'Eras' movie shows women have options:In 'Eras Tour' movie, Taylor Swift shows women how to reject the mandate of one identity
Take her steady support of friends who have fallen on hard times. Swift, for example, loaned her New York City home to Sophie Turner amid the “Game of Thrones” star’s divorce from Joe Jonas and gifted Kesha $250,000 after a judge ruled against the singer in a civil court case.
What’s more, after Swift won a countersuit against former country music DJ David Mueller, who groped her during a red-carpet event in 2013, “The Man” singer pledged money to the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit that helps counsel sexual assault survivors.
Perhaps the most personal of Swift’s charitable giving, however, is her ongoing support of those fighting cancer, just as both of Swift’s parents have battled cancer – an experience Swift writes about in “Soon You’ll Get Better,” a deep track on her "Lover" album.
Rather than make splashy, polarizing donations to Planned Parenthood, as fellow artists Harry Styles and Lizzo have done, Swift speaks up about important policy concerns but stops short of big politicized left-leaning donations – perhaps out of respect for her more traditional fans.
Swift rose to fame as a country singer, securing the admiration of more moderate women who found escape in songs like “Love Story” and “Ours,” in which Swift sings about prioritizing love, marriage and the allusion of family life over a depressing 9-to-5 cubicle job.
Yet, since her transition to pop superstardom and amassing a global following, Swift has done a remarkable job of staying true to her progressive values without overly politicizing her brand. Her focus, instead, is on connecting with her fans – whether from a stage or a hospital room.
Republicans should fear Swifties:Taylor Swift has power to swing the presidential election. What if nothing else matters?
What’s more, it’s reasonable to assume that a singer savvy enough to question the legitimacy of FTX, a now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, has already mapped out her philanthropic goals.
In fact, Swift could already be donating to the left-leaning groups that some people want her to give to, but – for a variety of reasons – does so privately, which is her prerogative and part of her constitutional right to free speech.
Whatever direction Swift decides to tack with her charitable giving – now or in the future – her decision likely will be personally driven, intentional and an extension of her already significant mark on the world of philanthropy. And, most important, the decision will be entirely her own.

If you struggle with blemished or aging skin, or from a skin condition such as acne, chances are you've tried many natural remedies to help. These may have included apple cider vinegar, vitamin supplements, essential oils or even a viral honey and cinnamon mask you may have seen trending on social media. 
But chances are, you've also turned to prescription and over-the-counter medications or topical applications in an attempt to find a solution. While there are many products offered by the $146-billion-dollar skin-care industry which include vitamin C serum and a host of lotions and creams, few such products or ingredients are more sought after than retinol. 
Retinol is a form of the fat-soluble nutrient vitamin A, and is a popular ingredient in skin cream topicals for its anti-aging effects. It's a type of retinoid - chemical compounds derived from vitamin A or chemically related to it - but is unique in that most retinoids are considered powerful enough to require a prescription while the retinol formula is mild enough to be available in over-the-counter form.
"Retinol is most commonly applied topically and only a small amount is needed," explains Dustin Portela, DO, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Treasure Valley Dermatology in Boise, Idaho. "To my patients, I recommend using a pea-size amount of cream or gel, or about four drops of the serum, to cover the whole face." 
Though retinol is mainly used as a lotion, cream, gel or serum, retinol-related medications can be taken orally as well to treat skin conditions and to help "prevent skin cancers in patients at higher risk of skin malignancies," says Anna Chien, MD, a board-certified dermatologist practicing in Columbia, Maryland, and an associate professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
Retinol is effective in a number of ways. It can unclog pores (and thereby improve acne), neutralize free radicals and exfoliate one's skin. "Retinol acts inside your skin cells on several different molecular pathways to help improve the skin's appearance," explains Portela. In this way, he says it can help boost collagen production and also minimize wrinkles and fine lines. 
Chien says that retinol can also improve skin turnover, decrease the size of sebaceous glands (glands found in hair follicles that secrete the oily substance sebum), even out pigmentation, decrease skin proliferation, improve skin texture and protect against signs of aging. Because of such varied functions, "it's used topically for acne, skin aging, discoloration and for certain skin diseases such as psoriasis," she says. 
While many people reap such benefits without experiencing side effects, "retinol does come with some risks," says Portela. He says the most common one is irritation of the skin. "It can disrupt the moisture barrier if you use too much or too strong of a retinol for your skin type," he cautions. 
Another area of concern is that it's possible for retinol to increase one's sensitivity to the sun. Because of this, "it is especially important to wear a daily sunscreen if you have incorporated retinol into your skin care routine," Portela advises. Retinol is also not generally recommended for use while pregnant.
When it comes to decreasing retinol's side effects related to skin irritation, Chien says that can "be managed with careful titration of its usage (combined with) a gentle skin care routine."

Seven months ago, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill student Elizabeth Grace Burton died two days after overdosing on a blend of drugs and alcohol, according to the Assembly, which was the first to report her death this week. 
A state autopsy report said Burton, 19, died of a brain injury caused by cardiac arrest following ingestion of a toxic mix of cocaine and alcohol, while a private autopsy also found fentanyl and Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) — a depressant known for its euphoric and calming effects — in Burton’s system. (The state report detected fentanyl in Burton’s urine, but officials did not say it contributed to her death.)
The university’s director of student wellness Dean Blackburn told WUNC last month that three active students and an alum have died of “fentanyl poisoning” in the last two years. The university would not confirm with USA TODAY if Burton was included in that tally. 
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid prescribed for severe pain management. It’s up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. Just 2 milligrams — an amount small enough to fit on the tip of a pencil — can be lethal. 
Because it’s so potent, fentanyl is often added to other drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin, making them cheaper and more dangerous, particularly for teens, college students and other young adults. 
“This scenario is sadly not uncommon, and it can happen to anyone,” said Dr. Ryan Marino, an emergency physician and addiction medicine specialist at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. “This is a reminder of how an unregulated drug supply is always going to be unpredictable and unsafe.”
The best and only way to eliminate the risk of accidental fentanyl exposure is to avoid drugs all together. But Marino says a more realistic piece of advice for those who plan on using them is to "never use alone." 
Here are other important things to know.
No. You cannot see, taste or smell any amount of fentanyl in drugs, the CDC says.
Never assume drugs are safe because you know where or who they came from, experts say; your body could also react differently every time you use drugs.
People can use test strips that detect fentanyl in different drugs like cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, and drug forms, such as pills, powder and injectables, in about five minutes.
It involves dissolving a small amount of a drug in water that you dip a piece of paper in. If the test is positive, throw the drugs out. If it’s negative, be wary because the strips aren't 100% accurate, can’t tell you how much fentanyl is present and can only detect a handful of fentanyl analogs: drugs with similar chemical structures, like the more potent carfentanil.
Still, experts recommend testing drugs anyway. “While they certainly aren’t foolproof, they’re an important tool we have that can reduce harms from an unsafe drug supply,” Marino said. 
Fentanyl test strips are available at your local health department or community organization; they can also be purchased online. Keep in mind, however, that some states consider these tests “criminal drug paraphernalia,” Marino said.
Symptoms of an opioid overdose include:
If you aren’t sure if a person is high or overdosing, the CDC suggests treating it like an overdose to be safe. Here’s what you should do:
Avoid putting a person suspected of overdosing in a cold shower or bath; hitting them to wake them up; or trying to make them vomit, as that can increase their risk of choking. 
And no, you can't overdose on fentanyl just by touching it.
In many cases — no. 
Most states have Good Samaritan laws that protect the person who is overdosing or the person who called 911 from certain criminal penalties.
About a year ago, Kristen Sotakoun casually perused her TikTok. She discovered a woman wanting everyone to guess her age. Sotakoun said: I don't need to guess, because I found it on your social media.
The 33-year-old had 30 followers at the time. Now, she has 1.1 million, and regularly posts about "consensual doxxing."
"It was total accident," Sotakoun says of her newfound hobby-turned-career of lightly stalking people online. The one-time Chicago restaurant server now makes enough money as a TikTok content creator to produce these videos full-time.
People have criticized her for the term she made up. There's nothing "consensual" about doxxing, when you publicly expose someone's personal information (such as a home address or phone number) in order to cause harm. But that's just it: she's facetious. Sotakoun doesn't jump down the rabbit holes of the internet on a quest to find someone's birthday unless they specifically ask (hence the "consensual" part).
Think of her as TikTok's Nancy Drew. "I look at it like a puzzle, and I've always loved puzzles," she says, and also wants to educate people about their online presence. Experts say "consensual doxxing" can be a useful tool for learning about how much information you've put out online about yourself or can simply be a fun activity – but consider it a cautionary tale, too.
"While people on TikTok aren't doing anything malicious with the information, people with intent to harass or harm could pick up doxxing techniques from these videos," says Kimberly Vered Shashoua, licensed clinical social worker. "Unfortunately, these videos highlight an uncomfortable truth: our lives are way more exposed online than we'd like to imagine."
The first TikTok Sotakoun made about "consensual doxxing," only one person commented. After her second video: Hundreds of comments per day. That number has held steady – she picks one or two out of these leads per day to pursue – partially because of the effort she puts into the task.
"It's evolved into people wanting to see the most creative way I found it," she says.
In her first viral video, for example, the subject in question had no videos, his profile picture had a cartoon filter over his face and the only remarkable attribute was that he was wearing glasses. She dug deep through his followers to find a family member, scrolled through her likes on Facebook and found someone else's profile picture where a man was wearing glasses. It correlated with a comment he made on TikTok about being an engineer, and that he lived in Florida, and so on.
"For many people, consensual doxxing is like a treasure hunt," Vered Shashoua says. "While making waves on TikTok, consensual doxxing has been a form of entertainment for awhile, such as in shows like 'Catfish.'"
Sotakoun is not perfect. Sometimes it's impossible to find people's birthdays when their profile is private, they have no followers, they follow no one and/or their username just has the word "user" and a bunch of numbers.
"Obviously, I cannot do anything with that," she says. She estimates she finds 70% to 80% of the people whose birthdays she looks up.
A note about the method to her madness: She doesn't use public records, just social media.
"I want to try to show you that info that you have provided, is the reason that I found your birthday, even though you think you're locked down, your digital footprint is not as good as you think," she says.
Brad Fulton, associate professor of management and social policy at the Indiana University – Bloomington, adds: "It’s important for people to know how much of their personal information can be found online, and consensual doxxing can provide a relatively safe way for someone to discover the extent of their online exposure."
In case you missed:'Dimple maker' trend is taking over TikTok, but could it cause permanent damage?
Sometimes people reach out asking her for tasks beyond birthdays – like to help solve cases. While flattering, she leaves that up to crime-fighting professionals.
"Everybody has the FBI friend of the group. But TikTok has really shown me that hey, I think maybe I'm pretty good at this," she says.
Of course, people may take the wrong lessons away from these videos (i.e. doxxing someone for real). But the positive response has outweighed the negative for Sotakoun.
"I'm hoping that it reaches people who are looking to be more private on the internet," she says. "I'm hoping that the greater good is happening here, and that people will watch my videos and say, 'oh, I need to follow these methods so I can be more protected myself on the internet' as opposed to people using it for more nefarious purposes."

There’s no contest: people love condiments. From ketchup, to mayo to mustard, condiments are a way to enhance flavors and textures that make an already great dish even better. We love to spread our favorite condiments on sandwiches, hot dogs, burgers and even pizza. (By now you’re either enraged or nodding along.) 
Diets have often demonized condiments because they can add calories, sugar and fat to a dish. But we want to hone in on one condiment in particular – mustard. Should mustard be lumped in with all condiments or does mustard offer unique benefits? We spoke with Lon Ben-Asher, MS, RD, LD/N, Registered Nutritionist and educator at Pritikin Longevity Center to find out everything you need to know about mustard. 
First, it’s worth mentioning that there are many different types of mustard. When you think of mustard, you most likely think of yellow mustard – the traditional bright yellow smooth paste that’s commonly zig-zagged on top of hot dogs and sandwiches. Other less common types of mustard include spicy mustard, dijon mustard and honey mustard. 
Yellow mustard, spicy mustard and dijon mustard all have very similar nutritional profiles. They are low in calories, sugar and fat, which makes them an excellent addition to a dish, especially if the goal is weight management. Ben-Asher explains, “Mustard can be utilized as a condiment which is low in calories and can help with weight management/control by enhancing flavor as an alternative to many high-calorie sauces, marinades and dressings.” 
Honey mustard, on the other hand, is a little bit different. Although its flavor balances sweetness with acidity in a harmonic way, it does add a little bit more calories, fat and sugar to your meal. One serving (1 tbsp) of yellow mustard, for example, has 9.2 calories, and negligible fat and sugar. One serving (1 tbsp) of honey mustard contains 69.5 calories, 6 grams of fat, and 2.4 grams of sugar. These statistics do not make honey mustard off limits, it’s just something you need to be mindful of. 
It turns out that mustard is packed with helpful nutrients. Ben-Asher says, “Mustard provides nutritional value as well by its mineral composition of selenium and magnesium, which are important for many systemic functions.” 
The powerful potential of mustard:How to use the condiment as an ingredient instead
According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, selenium is a trace mineral that is vital for the creation of various enzymes and proteins that help make DNA and protect cells from damage. Additionally, the NIH explains that magnesium is important for muscle and nerve function, regulation of blood sugar levels and blood pressure, and even the creation of DNA. 
Like many nutritious foods, mustard contains antioxidants. Ben-Asher adds, “In addition, mustard seeds contain antioxidant compounds called glucosinolates, which help protect cells from oxidative stress.” 
There’s some information floating around in the internet that says mustard is good for your liver. Turns out, this information is true. 
Ben-Asher explains, “Mustard can offer benefits to the liver in several ways.  It contains some compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties which can be beneficial for liver health. The mustard seeds contain omega-3 fatty acids, which can reduce inflammation and support liver function.  Mustard seeds can also support the liver’s detoxification processes and aid in eliminating toxins and other substances from the body.” 
We’ve learned that most types of mustard are low in calories, fat and sugar, so it seems to be like one of those foods we can enjoy. However, Ben-Asher says that there are still a few precautions, “It is considered safe to consume mustard daily and can be part of a healthy dietary pattern. It can be utilized as a low-calorie condiment to add flavor to foods without having a considerable impact on daily caloric intake. However, it’s important to consider for some individuals that intake may need to be limited or avoided. Although rare, mustard allergies can occur and if any adverse reactions are experienced – it should not be consumed.  Also, if someone has hypertension or other cardiovascular issues, many prepared mustards are high in sodium, therefore you may want to choose a no-salt-added or low-sodium version.”

Toby Keith is back in the driver's seat amid his battle with stomach cancer, and he's ready to perform for fans again.
The 62-year-old country star announced Friday that he will be headlining two Las Vegas shows in December to "get the band back in sync (and) get me rolling again," Keith said in a video posted to Instagram.
The concerts will take place on Dec. 10 and 11 at Dolby Live Park MGM Las Vegas. Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. on Oct. 27 and will be available at ticketmaster.com.
These will be what he called "rehab" shows that allow Keith to get reacquainted with performing. After being diagnosed with stomach cancer in fall 2021, the performer has taken a two-year break from music. He's done several public appearances recently, including at two pop-up concerts in Oklahoma and the People’s Choice Country Awards in Nashville.
In his video announcing the upcoming shows, Keith hinted at how his cancer treatments are going.
"I've been on the old rollercoaster. But Almighty's riding shotgun; he's letting me drive for some reason," he said in his Instagram video. "I was going to sit around here and do nothing like I have been. Or (I can) get up, go outside. Don't let the old man in, you know what I mean?"
He added, "(This is the) first time in my whole life I've been off over two years. I've never been off a year in my life. And through COVID and cancer, old devil's been at me a little bit.
"I've got him by the horns right now, so instead of just sitting around and waiting, we're going to get the band back together," he said.
Last month, Keith was honored with the 2023 Country Icon Award at the People’s Choice Country Awards. During his first televised performance since sharing his cancer diagnosis in June 2022, he performed "Don't Let the Old Man," his song from Clint Eastwood's 2018 film, "The Mule."
"I feel pretty good," Keith told E! News at the Nashville awards show. "It's a little bit of a roller coaster. You get good days and, you know, you're up and down."
He added, "It's always zero to 60 and 60 to zero, but I feel good today."

Local independent bookstores have never been more important. With fair access to literature under political attack, bookstores are a bulwark against censorship and an asset to the communities they serve.
Each week we profile an independent bookstore, discovering what makes each one special and getting their expert book recommendations.
This week we have Happy Medium Books Cafe in Jacksonville, Florida.
What’s your store’s story?
Happy Medium Books Cafe was a very personal journey, which beautifully morphed into the lives of three generations (mother, daughter, and granddaughter) sharing their love for literature, books, coffee and community. We are a creative, customer service and community focused team. Our Hispanic American women-owned small business is located in the heart of Jacksonville, Florida's Historic Riverside neighborhood.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
What makes your independent bookstore unique?
We are mothers, daughters, and advocates for unity and empowerment for all within our community. We bring our expertise of literature, coffee, and a little of "Abuelita's" recipes — made in-house and with much love.
What's your favorite section in your store?
Our store is sectioned in three. We have the main book section, the cafe and social space section, and our dedicated children's area where we have cute little chairs for the kiddos to hang out and read. My favorite section is the front of the house by our beautiful historic door and the main windows, where I enjoy seeing the beautiful afternoon sunset. It is also the first space where we welcome our guests and get to know them.
What book do you love to recommend to customers and why?
My personal favorite is "East of Eden" by John Steinbeck. Not only is he one of my favorite authors, but his works have warranted him coveted awards — the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Pulitzer Prize. His stories continue to be relatable, and all of his works beautifully embrace life with compassion and humility, while embodying the human spirit.
What book do you think deserves more attention and why?
"Remarkably Bright Creatures" by Shelby Van Pelt, because in a way I feel that I am living this remarkable and unique book. It teaches you to look into your past in a new light, and that nothing is impossible. I opened Happy Medium Books Cafe on an utter whim, with no experience, a painful past, and just the guts to go for it.
What upcoming books or series are you most excited about and why?
"Family Meal: A Novel" by Bryan Washington and "Wellness" by Nathan Hill. I truly hope to find the time to read these beautiful works of fiction. I am very drawn to stories and books that are relatable and humbling.
Why is shopping at independent bookstores important?
I think of the scene in "You've Got Mail" when the Fox family has no remorse whatsoever in shutting down the Shop Around the Corner. Books should be a reminder to everyone, that not all that is big and fancy is meaningful and or has a wonderful story.
What are some of your store's events, programs, or partnerships you would like to share?
We are excited to announce our upcoming children's story hour, writer's workshops, Spanish book club, book and wine club, sidewalk free library, and so much more!
Gwen Stefani has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and it's "Luxurious."
On Thursday, her three sons, husband Blake Shelton and her family celebrated the Grammy-winning No Doubt singer and "The Voice" coach during her Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony, where her star was unveiled on the sidewalk outside the iconic Amoeba Music store.
Several music industry heavyweights paid homage to her career as an artist before Shelton took to the stage to praise his wife, whom he said has a talent "she was just born with." Shelton himself received his star on Hollywood Boulevard in May.
"She has risen to the top over and over again with her unique style that has made the world fall in love with her − not as much as me, though," he said.
As her husband of two years lauded Stefani's personal and professional accomplishments, calling her "my all-time favorite songwriter," she occasionally wiped away tears.
"It was clear to me that she was a mother, first and foremost, over anything else in the world," Shelton said of first meeting her in 2014. "And now standing here, almost 10 years later after I first met her, I can say without question that being a mother is still the most important thing in her life."
He continued, "And I gotta tell you all, that's rare in this business."
Shelton joked that "it's nice to see her honored for her side project, which is being one of the biggest stars in the world."

Stefani's children – Apollo, 9, Zuma, 15, and Kingston, 17 – whom she shares with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, came out in support.
The four of them sweetly posed for photos and included stepdad Shelton and grandparents Patti and Dennis Stefani in some of their family pictures.
Stefani and Rossdale married in 2002 and filed for divorce in 2015. She married Shelton in 2021, and the country star has often enthused about being a stepfather.
"I can't imagine my life without these kids now," Shelton said in a 2021 radio interview.

"Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that this girl right here from Orange County would have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That just doesn't make sense to me," she said in a speech before the unveiling.
It was a full house as her parents, Dennis and Patti, as well as sister Jill and brothers Todd and Eric all came out to see her star unveiled.

PHOENIX − It was completely dead silence inside the Philadelphia Phillies’ clubhouse late Friday evening.
Players stared vacantly into their lockers in utter disbelief. The Phillies front office talked in hushed tones inside manager Rob Thomson’s office. Owner John Middleton stood silently down the hallway.
When the Phillies spoke after their stunning 6-5 meltdown to the Arizona Diamondbacks, it was in short, subdued snippets for cameras and reporters, trying to convince everyone they’ll be fine.
The look on their faces, however, lacked all confidence.
This is a team that arrived into Phoenix three days ago, talking about jumping into the pool at Chase Field once they swept away the Diamondbacks, debating who they’d rather play in the World Series.

They instead spent the night watching a safe eighth-inning lead melt in the desert, and are now in a fight for their lives.
The National League Championship Series may be tied at 2-apiece, but the Diamondbacks are now in the driver’s seat, with their ace, Zac Gallen, lined up for Game 5 [8:07 p.m. ET, TBS] at Chase Field before they return to Philadelphia.
"I’m tired of that narrative that we're lucky to be here …,’’ D-backs manager Torey Lovullo said. “I think they take things personal. They have a chip on their shoulder. I know their backup catcher [Garrett Stubbs] made a statement about sprinting towards the pool or making a beeline to the pool.
“So, I think they're wearing that a little bit, and they're motivated by that externally, and they're motivated to be as good as they possibly can internally.’’
NLCS GAME 4 RECAP:Kimbrel melts down as Diamondbacks rally to beat Phillies, even up NLCS
While the Diamondbacks celebrated their most dramatic playoff victory since winning the 2001 World Series, president Dave Dombrowski and GM Sam Fuld sat with Thompson in his office, trying to make sense of it all.
Sure, they have their ace, Zack Wheeler going in Game 5 against Gallen, but their bullpen is in utter disarray, having no idea who they can trust.
The man who has saved 417 career games, Craig Kimbrel, has melted down at the absolute worst time.
He lost Game 3 in the ninth inning, and for an encore, blew a 5-3 lead in the eighth inning.
He faced six batters Friday.
Four batters reached base.
And he nearly caused the roof to blow off Chase Field when he gave up a stunning game-tying, two-run home run to rookie Alek Thomas on a 3-and-2 fastball that splashed down in the pool. He dropped to his knees in agony as Thomas danced around the bases, basking in the deafening ovation.
“I mean, that play is definitely something that you see in your dreams,’’ Thomas said. “For it to come in real life and for it to happen to me is just awesome. I'm so grateful to have that moment. It's just unreal. Just crazy.
“I haven't really processed it yet, but it was awesome.’’
Four batters later, it was all over. Kimbrel left two batters on base when he was mercifully pulled, and Jose Alvarado couldn’t clean up his mess with Gabriel Moreno lining a single to center field for a 6-5 lead.
D-backs closer Paul Sewald came in for the ninth, gave up a two-run double to Kyle Schwarber, but struck out Trea Turner to complete the crazy night.
“I can't really describe how I feel,’’ Lovullo said, “because I haven't had a chance to interpret what just happened. It happened so quickly, and it was just a group of players banding together and getting the job done.’’
Well, Kimbrel shared the problem describing his emotions, too.
This is a guy who just three days ago was discussing the Hall of Fame in an interview room.
This night, he was proving why he’ll fall short of a Cooperstown induction.
It’s one thing to have the seventh-most saves in baseball history, but when the Boston Red Sox snub you during their 2018 World Series run by using starter Chris Sale for their final outs, and the Los Angeles Dodgers leave you completely off the roster in last year’s postseason, and you melt down for the Phillies a year later, you have a tarnished Hall of Fame resume.
Who knows if the Phillies will now trust him again the rest of the postseason?
Certainly, not in a critical moment.
Kimbrel, with his iPad open in his locker,  was the first one to speak in the Phillies clubhouse.
He responded quickly, succinctly, but had no real answers for the meltdown.
Question: “Craig, what happened to the 3-2 pitch to Thomas?
Kimbrel: “He hit it over the fence.’’
Question: Location?
Kimbrel: “I wouldn’t say location. It was terrible. He just put a good swing on it, and hit it out of the ballpark.’’
Question: How’s your confidence?
Kimbrel: “I mean, the last two games sucked. I roll up in here and cost us two games. … I can’t let that get in the way of what my job is and what I need to do. I need to show up and be ready.’’
Question: How do you keep your mind right?
“I mean, I’ve been doing this for a long time. I’ve lost a lot of ball games and I won a lot of ball games. And the only way you come back to be successful is believing you can. And I believe the next time I touch the ball it’s going to be great.
And, so it went for 1 minute, 42 seconds.
Kimbrel spoke about his inability to throw his curveball for strikes, falling behind in the count, insists he still has confidence, but has no idea whether he’ll be able to pitch for a third consecutive day if needed in Game 5.
Really, the Phillies have no idea who’ll be available until they check in with their relievers before Saturday’s game, praying that Wheeler, can go at least six innings, preferably seven, if not longer.
Still, they know they are in trouble.
They have an exhausted bullpen, using 11 relievers in the last two games to combine for 26 outs. They can no longer trust Kimbrel or rookie Orion Kenkering, and still have two pitchers they haven’t dared to use in games in Taijuan Walker and Michael Lorenzen.
Can they dare use Kimbrel in another save situation the rest of the postseason?
“We have to talk about it, but do you put him in at a little lower leverage spot?’’ Thomson said. “I don't know.’’
So, while the Diamondbacks are winning a game using eight different relievers like Friday, the Phillies are using an 11-man staff instead of 13, and suddenly are without a reliable closer.
Thomson has turned to Kerkering in crucial situations the last two games. And twice has imploded. He gave up three consecutive hits without retiring a batter in Game 3, and walked two batters and got one out in Game 4. He suddenly has lost command, falling behind in counts, and the price.
“That’s how you turn good hitters into great hitters,’’ Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto said. “We’re just falling behind too much and not attacking.’’
Perhaps the most alarming facet of the Phillies’ predicament is that they’ve managed to shut down the D-backs’ power-hitting trio of Corbin Carroll, Christian Walker and Tommy Pham, and it has made little difference. They are hitting just .071 in the series without an extra-base hit, but they haven’t figured out a way to stop leadoff hitter Ketel Marte, who’s hitting .471 (8-for-17) and reached base three more times Friday.
Much of the Phillies’ pain is also self-inflicted, with the Diamondbacks scoring one run on an error, passed ball and pitcher Cristopher Sanchez forgetting how many outs there were in an inning, another on a wild pitch, and their bullpen issuing four walks and a hit-by-pitch leading to four runs in the seventh and eighth innings.
“It’s just a sloppy game all around,’’ Realmuto said. “It’s not acceptable to play that way when the game is big.’’
The Phillies tried to shrug it off, with Alvarado saying, “Hey, it’s baseball,’’ but the Phillies’ confidence is clearly shaken. The swagger is gone. They may have games 6 and 7 scheduled in Philadelphia, but they can’t solely rely on their fans saving them from disaster.
It’s enough for the D-backs to believe they can not only play with the powerful Phillies, but slay the dragon, shocking the baseball world.
“We’re not going to give up,’’ said Thomas, 23, the youngest player in postseason history to hit a game-tying pinch-hit homer in the eighth inning or later. “‘How could we? We’re not done yet.
“We’re going to keep on doing our thing and hopefully good things happen.’’

On a cloudy fall day in Washington, D.C., Brandon Washington lit up the field with an electric 63-yard touchdown run. On his third offensive play of the game, the quarterback took the snap, scampered through the line of scrimmage and sprinted his way straight down the middle of the field all the way to the end zone.
Not only was it the Gallaudet Bison’s first score of the day, but it was the first touchdown for the 5G-connected helmet, a technology the world’s only liberal arts university for deaf and hard-of-hearing students developed with AT&T. Wearing the helmet, a player doesn’t have to hear a play call, but can see it.
"It was great, cushioned on the inside. It really fits my head," Washington told USA TODAY Sports of the helmet, which went through several iterations before game day. "The lens is not too big or too small, so I can see really, really good out of it. I really love the helmet.”
After Washington and the Bison beat the Hilbert Hawks 34-20 in the Oct. 7 home game at Hotchkiss Field, the junior was named the Eastern Collegiate Football Conference co-offensive player of the week for putting up 124 rushing yards and three touchdowns.
"Brandon is one of the most electrifying players that we've had come through here," Coach Chuck Goldstein said. "He’s pretty special and talented.”
AT&T's Chief Marketing and Growth Officer, Kellyn Smith Kenny, was at the game to officially unveil the 5G-connected Riddell helmet and present a gift of $500,000 to the team.
"The stands were going crazy," Smith Kenny said of Washington's first score. "I'm like turning around high-fiving everyone. It was so, so incredibly special.”
The 5G-connected helmet uses the same technology that powers cell phones across the United States.
AT&T placed a microprocessor inside a Riddell helmet. It is connected to a lens mounted on the top of the helmet's facemask.
A coach can select a play on a tablet and then send it to the player, who can then see the play displayed on the lens.
Goldstein explained how Gallaudet, who invented the huddle in 1894 because the team needed to protect their communication using American Sign Language, embraced the helmet. He said that getting used to sending a play to the helmet slows down his current process communicating with Washington and freshman quarterback Trevin Adams, but he understands the overall helpfulness of the technology.

"Every other game that we prepare for, we do what we normally do and I think people don't realize is, when we communicate in our language, ASL, we're pretty fast. We're efficient. We're fast," he said. "What this does, this helps level the playing field with limiting mistakes, getting somebody's attention. When Trevin's in the game, and he's further away, he's not looking at me, I cannot get (his attention). We’re living with whatever play that’s called, that's it. This gives us an opportunity for me to get his attention. There’s a red exclamation point on the tablet, I hit it, it pops up. He knows automatically to stop what he's doing and look at me."
Athletic director Warren Keller pondered how the helmet could have a positive impact for hearing players as well.
"Just imagine how often in each NFL game, with 80,000 fans screaming in attendance, how many times there's a delay of game, offsides?" he said in ASL through an interpreter. "How many timeouts are burned, how many penalties occur because people are so reliant on being able to hear? But having this visual access and being able to communicate in that way, this technology with Gallaudet's help guiding, this will be able to change the future."
Derek Carr, quarterback of the NFL's New Orleans Saints, recently made headlines when Taysom Hill noticed the ear hole coverings on his helmet. Carr explained to his teammate that they help block out crowd noise.
Smith Kenny said the possibilities for the helmet go beyond football.
"We've had people reach out to us saying, 'Hey, if you think about the capabilities of the helmet, could a 5G-connected helmet improve safety on construction sites or for first responders, or even potentially lead to more job opportunities for the deaf community?'" she shared. "It's incredibly exciting and inspiring."
Brandon Washington and Trevin Adams are the Gallaudet quarterbacks for whom the 5G helmets were designed. The helmet is giving them opportunities to shine on a national stage.
They are featured in AT&T's commercial that debuted last week during "College GameDay" showing what the 5G-connected helmet can do. Washington was cheering next to Goldstein as Adams scored a touchdown using the helmet. The background track, "Sound of Silence" is sung by partially-deaf artist Amira Unplugged and all of the promotional videos have open captioning.
Washington, a junior who hails from Citronelle, Ala., wore the helmet in its debut and scored three touchdowns as the Bison beat Hilbert. He offered feedback to the AT&T team as the helmet went through several iterations, including that an early version was too heavy due to a bulky battery pack.
This is his second year playing quarterback after Goldstein moved him from wide receiver because of depth needs.
"At first, I was telling him, 'Nah, nah, I don’t wanna play quarterback,'" Washington told USA TODAY Sports. "But then, you know, I got over it and I was like, 'Yeah, I do wanna play quarterback because I want to touch the ball.' I want the ball in my hands. I like to score."
He was last year's ECFC Offensive Player of the Year when the team won the conference championship. He had 1,363 yards of total offense on the season, including eight rushing touchdowns.
Last year, Adams captured the eight-man football championship with the California School for the Deaf-Riverside to cap off an undefeated season with an 80-26 victory. He wanted to attend Gallaudet because both of his parents went there, and his father played football for the Bison. The family attended a celebration for the school's 150th anniversary, which was observed through the 2013-14 school year, and Adams wanted to carry on the tradition.
"I knew this was going to be the university I was gonna go to," Adams said in ASL through an interpreter. "And it's just top notch, 100% deaf access, all the teachers can sign, everybody. It is all ASL access everywhere and I just thought I knew that this was going to be my university. And now here I am a student and I've loved it. Gallaudet just is awesome."
"Trevin coming in, and as a freshman, has really been a blessing," Goldstein said. "He is the future of this program, of this team, of this community. He’s great. The future is really looking good. We're OK, we're gonna be in good hands for the next four more, three more years after this."
Gallaudet prides itself on being at the forefront of innovation to create equality for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
The school’s president, Roberta “Bobbi” Cordano, is the first deaf woman and first openly LGBTQ person to hold the position. She was named one of USA TODAY's Women of the Year for her leadership.
"I think it's the daily work of being president of Gallaudet to advance equality. That's my job. That's what I do," she said. "And to make sure that our students have the opportunity and the preparation and the tools they need to go out into the world and thrive. That's advancing equality."
While the 5G-connected helmet is a major breakthrough, there is still a ways to go in leveling the playing field for deaf and hard-of-hearing athletes.
"I wanna make sure people understand: Our players, no matter what, any game we show up, it doesn’t matter who the opponent is or who we have on our roster, we’re never gonna have a level playing field. We just won’t," Goldstein said. "There is a communication barrier."
One of those barriers is with officials who don't sign.
"An official can tell a hearing player on the other team to scoot back or, 'Hey watch your hands on this' or 'Don’t do that,'" Goldstein said. "If he does communicate that with our players, our player’s probably reading his lips, and that’s not fair."
Gallaudet's players also can't hear a whistle being blown, which can be a safety issue.
"If somebody, the whistle’s blown and somebody makes an athletic move on the other team, we’re going to tackle him, always," the coach continued. "I tell our players, 'That’s the one thing I’m not gonna get mad at you about, if you tackle somebody late. Because we’d rather get a 15-yard penalty compared to six points that we give up.'"
And while the helmet helps with player-coach communication, it was only authorized by the NCAA for use in one game and was only worn by the quarterback.
"So this technology is gonna help bridge the gap to a level playing field, it’s gonna help us get closer," he said, "but until I can put every player in one of these helmets — and who knows 20 years from now if this is something that will be used at every level of football — it’s just gonna help bridge the gap and it’s gonna make a difference for us."
Take it from Jim Schwartz. It’s way too early to consider the Cleveland Browns' defense as one of the best in NFL history.
That’s no kind of knock on the amazing pace the NFL’s stingiest defense has established through five games this season. The Browns – leading the league for fewest yards, passing yards, points, first downs and third-down conversions allowed – have some of the best numbers ever produced at this point in a campaign. If this holds up, the comparisons to great defenses of yesteryear will be validated.
Yet it’s still early. 
“Well, they don’t give out any trophies for five weeks,” Schwartz, Cleveland’s defensive coordinator, said during a news conference this week. “I think we all know that. It’s a long season, and we’re going to have to survive a lot of highs and lows throughout the season.
“We have some experienced players. We have some experienced coaches that have been there, that know that. And I think that’s one of the things that keeps us grounded. So let me know when the five-week stats are part of the tiebreaker. When they are, we’ll really concentrate on that.”
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
Schwartz – whose perspective includes landing his only NFL head-coaching shot with the task of taking over a Detroit Lions squad that finished 0-16 the season before – has long been established as one of the league’s premier defensive strategists.

That’s being proven again already during his first year with the Browns, as he has employed a wide-nine front and other wrinkles and surprises (see Myles Garrett’s feigned “crossover dribble” while lined up as a stand-up middle linebacker against the Bengals) to help a talented unit reach new heights.
Getting a glimpse of Schwartz fielding questions as he prepared for Sunday’s game at Indianapolis, though, showed that in addition to pushing the right buttons when it involves the X’s and O’s, he also set the proper tone against the landscape of the what-have-you-done-lately NFL.
Someone asked Schwartz to assess how defensive end Ogbo Okoronkwo is faring. The response was classic, given that for all of the defensive superlatives, the Browns (3-2) are in third place in the A-North.
“He’s playing 3-2, right?” Schwartz said. “I mean, we’re all playing 3-2. Our defensive stats are 3-2, everything else, and he’s doing his job within – I don’t want to downplay it. I just don’t want to get into the whole rate of everybody’s play. It’s not about individuals. We talked about that last week. It’s about the group. It’s about all 11.”
He praised Okoronkwo’s effort and physicality, then finished by stating, “We’ll leave PFF (Pro Football Focus) to grading the players and where they rank in the league and all those things.”
In any event, the “all 11” and additional role players on Schwartz’s unit can certainly take a bow for how they handled one of the hottest offenses in the league in the 19-17 upset of the previously unbeaten San Francisco 49ers last Sunday. The 49ers, who scored at least 30 points in their first five games, were limited to 215 total yards.
For the season, Cleveland has allowed just 1,002 yards – third-fewest in the NFL through five games since 1970, after the 1971 Colts (836) and 1970 Vikings (945). This is connected to the league’s best rate on third downs, with just 15 conversions on 65 attempts (23.1%).
So many of the numbers are staggering. The Browns have allowed just 52 first downs, even more impressive when considering the team with the next-fewest, Tampa Bay, has allowed 94 first downs.
While the sack total (15) is average and the takeaways (four) way on the low end, that’s covered by the minimal yards (220.4 per game) and points allowed (77).
So maybe it’s a bit early to rank the Browns' defense among the best ever. But even Schwartz doesn’t mind his talented unit rolling with a fair amount of swagger.
“That would look foolish if we’re out there giving up 42 points,” Schwartz said. “If we’re last in the league on third-down percentage and things like that, then it just becomes clownish behavior. But I think a lot’s being said with if you’re going to have some personality and some swagger, then you better back it up on the field. And I like our guys’ ability to do that.”
The scrutiny on new quarterback Derek Carr was intense enough when considering the disastrous results the New Orleans Saints have produced when getting near the goal line this season.
Now the heat has gone up a few notches – by Carr’s own actions during the 31-24 loss against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday.
Carr was shown blowing a gasket after an ugly incompletion – receiver Chris Olave stopped while apparently running a third-down go route – during the nationally televised game on Amazon. It was not a good look, and not the only example of questionable body language to express frustration.
“I’ve been showing my emotion a little bit too much on my sleeve,” Carr told reporters during his postgame news conference. “You know, like, I kind of got to kind of chill out, and that’s me holding myself accountable. Because that’s not going to help anything.
“I can do a better job as a leader to calm everybody down.”
He can also help the Saints reverse their red-zone patterns. New Orleans entered Week 7 ranked 28th in the NFL for TD rate after reaching the red zone (36.8%, seven TDs on 19 possessions), then scored just two TDs on five red-zone trips against the Jaguars.
Carr, though, couldn’t be blamed for the result of a perfect pass that slipped through the fingers of tight end Foster Moreau in the end zone in the final seconds. And what he said afterward, when it was mentioned that teammates rallied around a distraught Moreau, suggests that he gets it when considering how his response can make a difference.
“I’ve been in that moment, when you miss a throw or you throw a bad pick or something like that, you feel like everybody hates you,” Carr said. “Our job as teammates is no matter what the situation, good or bad, is that you put your arm around him and keep ‘em going.”
In other words, pointing fingers is not the ticket.
The trade that brought Mecole Hardman back to Kansas City from the New York Jets could be huge for a Chiefs offense that has struggled to get consistent production from its wide receivers. Hardman, a second-round pick by the Chiefs in 2019, left in March on a one-year, $4 million free-agent deal. But he was lost in the wash, so to speak, with a Jets offense trying to recover from Aaron Rodgers’ torn Achilles tendon. In five games with the Jets, Hardman caught one pass for six yards. Now he’s back, essentially for the price of a sixth-round pick.
Hardman certainly won’t be lost in reuniting with Patrick Mahomes for at least two reasons: 1) opportunity and need. 2) familiarity.
Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy likened the expectation of Hardman flowing in KC’s offense to “riding a bike.”
“It’s not always just super simple,” Nagy said during a Thursday news conference, “but it is certainly easier for somebody like him that’s been here to come back in and go.”
Especially with Kansas City wideouts Marques Valdes-Scantling, Kadarius Toney and Skyy Moore combining for 35 catches and two TDs, behind second-round rookie Rashee Rice’s 21 receptions and two TDs.
The Chiefs found multiple ways of using Hardman’s top-end speed in recent years, including as a weapon in running jet sweeps and as a returner. His 2022 season, though, was cut short after eight games due to a pelvic/abdominal injury that had him hospitalized for 10 days.
“Scary as hell,” is how Hardman described his injury last year.
If he regains his groove in the Chiefs' offense, Hardman could reflect a different type of fear factor for opposing defenses.
For all the woes that have struck the New York Giants' offensive line – four linemen this week were added to the roster from various practice squads, while the G-men scramble to settle on a left tackle with Joshua Ezeudu placed on IR due to a toe injury – it’s notable the unit still hasn’t allowed the most sacks in the NFL. That dubious distinction belongs to Washington, which heads into the matchup against the Giants on Sunday having allowed 34 sacks. New York has yielded 33 sacks. Considering that the league average is 15 ½ sacks allowed, it’s reasonable to project a sackfest for MetLife Stadium this weekend.
As of Friday, Giants coach Brian Daboll wasn’t ready to declare a starting left tackle, with the candidates including Justin Pugh, Josh Myles and Tyre Phillips. Pugh re-joined the team two weeks ago, while Myles and Phillips were signed this week off practice squads for Atlanta and Philadelphia, respectively, with New York losing seven of its original nine offensive linemen this season to injuries.
“Yeah, we have four new players on the offensive line that have been here for some less than a week, some less than two weeks, and we’re working tirelessly with them in terms of meetings, getting them up to speed on calls, practicing them at different spots,” Daboll told reporters. “You have to have plans, too. If one guy gets hurt, then here’s the next guy, they’re not playing that spot. There’s been a lot of shuffling. We’re trying our best to have as best continuity as we can, but those are the circumstances we are faced with.”
The Eagles signing of veteran wide receiver Julio Jones offers the promise of a playmaker with seven Pro Bowl selections on his resume … and caution. Jones, 34, is with his fourth team in as many seasons, and has missed seven games in each of the past three seasons with Tampa Bay, Tennessee and Atlanta, due to assorted injuries.
Philadelphia coach Nick Sirianni, whose offense could use a jolt as receiver DeVonta Smith nurses a hamstring injury, liked what he saw from Jones on the practice field this week. But he must weigh that against the notion of expecting too much, too soon.
“You’re going to be tempted to want to put him in because he’s a phenomenal player that’s done a lot in this league,” Sirianni said. “We are going to have to make sure that we’re not putting him in danger.”
The college football season has reached the back nine with seven weeks down and seven more to go before the playoff pairings and bowl lineup is announced. Between now and then, there's sure to be surprises along the way.
The hard part is sorting out when and where they're going to come from. This Saturday, however, provides plenty of opportunity for upsets and unlikely results with a Big Ten showdown between Penn State and Ohio State leading the schedule and key conference matchups in the SEC, Pac-12 and ACC.
That's why we're here to make sense of things. The USA TODAY Sports college football staff — Scooby Axson, Jace Evans, Paul Myerberg, Erick Smith, Eddie Timanus and Dan Wolken — weigh in with bold predictions for Week 8 of the college football season.
If there is a Group of Five team you should be paying attention to, it’s Air Force, and even though quarterback Zac Larrier is out because of a knee injury, the Falcons should have no issues handling Navy this weekend.
And if the Falcons keep winning, the College Football Playoff committee will be forced to pay attention, and with good reason. The undefeated Falcons lead the nation in fewest penalties, third-down conversions, and rushing offense, while keeping the ball for nearly 35 minutes a game. The defense is also doing its part, ranking in the top 10 in rushing defense, passing defense, scoring defense, and total defense, with that unit being on the field for the fewest plays of any team in the nation. — Scooby Axson
MUST-WATCH: Big Ten clash leads six best games of college football's Week 8
WEEKEND FORECAST: Picks for Ohio State-Penn State and each Top 25 game
Utah has defeated Southern California three consecutive times, including twice last season to single-handedly keep the Trojans out of the College Football Playoff. But No. 16 USC will get some revenge, and a needed bounce-back win after last week’s debacle in South Bend, against the No. 14 Utes. Yes, Utah’s defense has been great and USC’s has still been mostly bad; but you need to score some points to beat the Trojans and the Utes just can’t do it. Utah is sitting 115th in yards per game and is tied for 109th in scoring. USC trails only Oregon in points per game and is No. 9 in total offense – and it seems unlikely Caleb Williams is going to throw three picks two weeks in a row. It might be a long day for the Utes at the L.A. Coliseum. — Jace Evans
Alabama’s offense comes alive and sparks a blowout win against Tennessee. We’ve seen this happen in chunks against opponents such as Arkansas only for Jalen Milroe and the Crimson Tide to struggle putting teams away in the second half. A more complete performance in double-digit win against the Volunteers would show how far the Tide have come since losing to Texas and struggling against South Florida. — Paul Myerberg
This weekend will go one of two ways for Texas. The buildup of disappointment from the past two weeks after the loss to Oklahoma will be released in cathartic fashion against Houston. The alternative is that stewing for that long will allow the Longhorns to take their eye off the ball when traveling to face the Cougars, whose season will be made by beating their former Southwest Conference rival in their only season as Big 12 opponents. Past versions of the Longhorns would slip up in this spot. We'll not go that far, but expect a raucous home crowd help keep Houston in the game and the finish to be way closer than expected. — Erick Smith
Utah will emerge victorious against Southern California in the Coliseum. At first blush this might not seem like a bold pronouncement, since the Utes beat the Trojans not once but twice last season. Nevertheless, with the Utes still likely to be without quarterback Cam Rising, the Trojans are touchdown favorites at home according to most outlets.
But we’re not buying. Sure, USC still has Caleb Williams. But the reigning Heisman winner doesn’t have the elite receiving talent he had a year ago, nor does he have the same pass protection. Notre Dame forced five turnovers last week, and the Utes’ defensive front is even nastier. Utah should also be able to move the ball on the ground, with or without Rising. They might not win it going away, but the Utes will prevail. — Eddie Timanus
The Ohio State game has been the biggest negative on James Franklin's resume at Penn State. Outside of that 2016 win in State College, the Nittany Lions have found a lot of frustration in this matchup with a couple of one-point losses and maybe one or two other opportunities to win that they've let slip by. But is that really a Penn State thing, or is it just illustrative of how hard it is for anyone to beat Ohio State in this era?
I think it's the latter. But the Buckeyes appear to be just a tiny bit more beatable this year — not by much, but by enough to put them in jeopardy of losing to perhaps Franklin's best team at Penn State. 
While the Nittany Lions aren't necessarily as dynamic offensively as you'd like, we saw how much trouble Notre Dame's defense gave Ohio State earlier in the season. And Penn State's defense is probably a cut above that. So even in Columbus, this lines up as the year for Franklin to get Penn State's first win in the Horseshoe since 2011. — Dan Wolken
Visa-free travel for short-term visits to the U.S. for Israelis is now available.
Israel officially became part of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program on Thursday, which allows eligible Israeli citizens and nationals to travel to the U.S. for up to 90 days on business or tourism without having to first obtain a visa.
The admittance came earlier than estimated. On Sept. 27, when admittance to VWP was announced, authorities said it would take until Nov. 30 to complete.
"Israel’s entry into the Visa Waiver Program represents a critical step forward in our strategic partnership with Israel that will further strengthen long-standing people-to-people engagement, economic cooperation, and security coordination between our two countries,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a Sept. 27 statement.
The VWP requires the person looking to come to the U.S. sans visa to "be from a country that extends to U.S. citizens and nationals the privileges we would extend to their citizens and nationals," according to a DHS press release.

People can apply for the program via the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) or via its mobile app. Approval may take up to 72 hours.
To be eligible for VWP, Israeli citizens and nationals must have a biometrically enabled passport book. Currently, the application is only available in English, but other languages are slated to come on Nov. 1.
The change comes as the conflict continues to build in the Middle East. The death toll of Israelis and Palestinians surpassed 5,000 on Thursday, becoming the deadliest war on the Gaza Strip.

Amsterdam will increase its tourist tax in 2024 in a continued effort to crack down on rowdy tourists. The new rate will be the highest in Europe and the fourth highest globally.
The new tax rate for overnight visitors will be 12.5%, up substantially from 7%, according to an announcement by the city earlier this month.
The more expensive tax means tourists will be contributing more to the very city they're enjoying.
"This allows us to address the consequences of overtourism and direct additional resources to keeping the streets clean and solving acute problems in neighbourhoods and districts," Hester van Buren, deputy mayor for finance, said in a statement.

With the average room rate of €175 ($185.32), this translates to a €21.80 ($23.09) per night tax. Currently, the tax would be €15.25 ($16.03).
Cruise passengers will also be paying more too. The current tax is €8 ($8.41), and it's slated to go up to €11 ($11.56) per person per day.
By increasing the tourist tax, the city said it won't raise parking fees or property tax rates for its residents, according to the announcement. The tourist tax revenue will go directly into enhancing Amsterdam neighborhoods, such as growing the city's green spaces.
Next up on the to-do list is finding a way to tax day-trippers, van Buren told DutchNews.
The city's ongoing battle between troublesome tourists and locals goes back years. In 2019, the city banned guided tours in the Red Light District and this past March, launched a "Stay Away" campaign.
Amsterdam isn't the only city making travelers pay for their share. A few weeks ago, Iceland announced a tourist tax that would help protect its natural resources, which are a main draw for visitors. So did Venice and Bali. Even places in the U.S. charge a tourist tax. In Honolulu, travelers have to pay a total of 13.25% for their accommodations, and that money supports services like lifeguards and hiking trail maintenance.

UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay.
Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports.
Their partnership should have been a force for good. Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.
The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.
Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.
But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.
According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.
“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”
In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”
“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”
Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.
The stakes are high for everyone.
Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.
Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.
Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.
Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.
“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”
USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.
Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.
For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.
Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.
For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.
“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”
Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.
Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.
At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.
By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.
Tucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.
Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline
Tucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.
Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.
Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.
Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.
During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.
They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.
In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”
It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.
Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.
Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.
They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.
Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.
By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.
Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.
Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”
Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.
Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.
Twelve days later came the call.
Tracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.
According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.
“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”
Tracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”
She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.
“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”
Tracy said she thought to herself, "Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it." In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”
When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.
Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.
Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.
At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.
Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.
When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.
Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.
Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”
Tucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.
The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.
Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.
She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.
Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.
“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”
The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.
A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.
Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.
Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.
Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.
Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.
Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.
“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.
Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.
Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.
Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.
Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.
They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.
“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”
Michigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.
The case would go forward.
Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22.
He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.
For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.
Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.
An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.
Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.
During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”
Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.
“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”
Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.
Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.
Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.
Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.
At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.
Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.
Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”
Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.
One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.
A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”
“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”

On a sunny Thursday morning, Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker strolled through tomato fields at a farm in Immokalee, Florida, toured its processing plants and loaded baskets of bright green fruit into a truck. 
It was a private event thrown by the school to promote its migrant student services program, which provides financial aid and support to farmworkers seeking college degrees. After the April 28, 2022, tour, disclosed in records obtained by USA TODAY this week, Tucker met with community leaders and alumni.
That night, Tucker would make the now-infamous phone call from his hotel room in nearby Naples, during which he is accused of masturbating and making unwanted sexual comments to Brenda Tracy, a prominent rape survivor and activist he had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence.
Yet, when Tucker met with the university’s outside investigator in March for his interview in the sexual harassment case against him, he insisted the trip was not work-related – a claim the investigator would disprove in her report.
It’s just one example of Tucker failing to keep his story straight at the most consequential moment of his career. 
With his job, reputation and the roughly $80 million left on his contract at stake, Tucker repeatedly made false statements to the investigator and misled her about basic facts, such as his location during the phone call and the date it occurred, a USA TODAY review of more than 1,200 pages of case documents found. 
The investigator, Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, and the news organization both obtained documents and witness statements that discredit key aspects of Tucker’s version of events. 
Michigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sept. 10, hours after Tracy went public for the first time with her story in USA TODAY. On Monday, the school informed Tucker it plans to fire him for cause based on the conduct he had admitted to and the embarrassment he had caused the school. 
Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivor
Although Tucker denied sexually harassing Tracy, he acknowledged masturbating on the call, saying he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex.” Tracy said Tucker’s romantic interest in her was completely one-sided and that she had tried to set boundaries multiple times during their yearlong business partnership.
Per his contract, Tucker has until Tuesday to make a case for keeping his job. Regardless, a formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated school policies against sexual harassment and exploitation is expected to proceed on Oct. 5 and 6. 
Since his suspension, Tucker has issued multiple public statements defending himself, attacking Tracy and accusing Veidlinger of bias. He accused the school of conducting a “sham” hearing and having “ulterior motives.” Yet even in these written statements, the central details of his story changed entirely.
Tucker, who previously hung up on a reporter who called him on his cellphone asking about the case, did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. His attorney, Jennifer Belveal, has not responded to phone calls and emails. Tracy declined to comment for this story.
In the absence of eyewitnesses or recordings, sexual harassment cases usually boil down to whose account is more credible, said Elizabeth Abdnour, a Lansing-based attorney and former Michigan State Title IX investigator who has taken part in dozens of campus cases.
“It’s very, very unusual that you would have some outside piece of evidence that would give you a clear decision,” Abdnour said. “Very often you’re weighing credibility based on little bits and pieces of information.” 
In multiple cases she has worked, Abdnour said the respondents lost because they were found to have a greater propensity for lying than the complainants. The hearing officer must determine how much weight to give Tucker’s false and conflicting statements, Abdnour said, and they could sway the case in Tracy’s favor.
“I believe a fact finder could assess these pieces of evidence about credibility and make a determination that Brenda is more credible than Mel,” she said. “In my experience, a clear sign of a lack of credibility is generally taken very seriously.”
By the time Tucker met with Veidlinger for his interview, he had had months to prepare.
The school had informed him of Tracy’s complaint on Dec. 22, the day after she filed it. Veidlinger had interviewed Tracy and all six of her witnesses by the end of January. Tucker was the only holdout.
Rather than tell his side of the story right away, Tucker and his attorney spent three months trying to stop the investigation, case documents show. They wrote legal arguments urging Michigan State to drop the case and twice approached Tracy’s attorney proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no, and the school pressed forward.
On March 22, the day of his interview, Tucker sent Veidlinger a seven-page written account of his interactions with Tracy and lists of their “currently existing” text message and call history, which he said his legal team had compiled. Only a handful of text messages remained; he and Tracy both told the investigator they had deleted their texts with each other in the months after the April 2022 phone call.
In his interview, which lasted 3 ½ hours, Tucker questioned whether Tracy had mixed up the date of the call. He said he recalled being at his home in East Lansing when it occurred, but his own records showed that he had been in Florida on April 28, attending a charity function that was “absolutely not a University-sponsored event.”
His seven-page account told a different story – that he had called her while he was “alone in a hotel room.”
Veidlinger does not appear to have asked Tucker about the discrepancy, based on case documents. But by then she knew what he told her in the interview was untrue: she had already obtained records proving he had not been home in East Lansing.
An expense report he had submitted to the university for reimbursement of his hotel and meals shows Tucker flew to Naples, Florida, to attend a golf fundraiser hosted by The Greg H. Montgomery Jr. Foundation for Ultimate Growth, which raises awareness for suicide prevention. It showed he stayed at the Hilton from April 27 to 29, that the trip’s purpose was “administrative” and that it did not involve personal travel. He had flown there on a donor’s private plane.
The trip is when Tucker toured the farm in Immokalee to help promote Michigan State’s College Assistance Migrant Program. The event was titled “Working to make dreams a reality,” according to an agenda obtained from the university by USA TODAY through a public records request. The agenda features Tucker’s name prominently. Tucker posted photos from the tour on his Twitter account.
That Tucker was on a university-sponsored work trip during the incident was a contributing factor in the university’s determination that it had jurisdiction to investigate, the investigation report shows. 
Tucker’s lists of calls and text messages also were missing an important detail: They did not show any communication with Tracy on April 28. He acknowledged in the interview, however, that he had not reviewed the lists before submitting them and that they may have been incomplete.
Tracy, meanwhile, had already provided Veidlinger with her official cellphone records from Sprint that confirmed the date of their call: April 28.
Tucker and Tracy did not speak in the three months after the April 28 call.
Meanwhile, their assistants were planning Tracy’s third visit to campus – an in-person training with coaches and players scheduled for July 25.
Tucker canceled that training three days before, the investigation report shows. When Tracy spoke to him by phone on Aug. 2 seeking to find out why, she would tell the investigator in her interview that Tucker insinuated he would harm her career if she spoke about his conduct. He never rescheduled her visit, and they never spoke again.
The cancellation became a key focus of the investigator – one of a series of alleged incidents that taken together would meet the definition of sexual harassment, which can include pressuring someone into engaging in sexual behavior for an employment benefit and threatening that rejecting such behavior will carry a negative consequence.
“Reported allegations that a University employee is engaging in misconduct within the vendor-vendee relationship for which they are the decision-maker, and/or impeding in such a services relationship based on a quid-pro-quo sexual harassment allegation, is within a University sponsored program or activity,” Veidlinger wrote in the report, so school policy covered it.
Tucker tried to distance himself from the cancellation in a public statement on Sept. 11, the day after Michigan State suspended him without pay.
“I never cancelled any presentation,” he wrote. “Given a personnel change and scheduling challenges as football season approached, we merely postponed it until January 2023. She chose to file her complaint instead of proceeding with the training.”
But that statement contradicts what he told the investigator. When Veidlinger asked in his March interview if he had a role in canceling Tracy’s visit, Tucker said, “Yes, absolutely I did,” the report shows, and that he did not recall any discussions about rescheduling Tracy for January. Such timing would not make sense, he added, because most of his new players would not yet be on campus. 
Tucker also told the investigator why he canceled the visit, blaming it on a scheduling conflict. He said he had recently hired a mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, who needed to implement his new program on short notice. There was limited time in fall camp, Tucker said, and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” the players. He said he decided to yield the time to Newman.
Veidlinger, however, would later obtain records showing Newman did not meet with the team on July 25, the day of Tracy’s planned visit. He had been meeting with them weekly since June 6, the records showed but held no meetings between July 15 and July 28.
One of Tucker’s assistants, who is a witness in the case, also told the investigator that Tucker asked him via text message to cancel it. He said he was never instructed to reschedule. 
In his interview, Tucker told Veidlinger that his relationship with Tracy frayed after the April 2022 phone call – not because of the incident, but because of information he learned after that caused him not to trust her.
According to Tucker, an associate of his had told him over the summer that Tracy’s assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, had been gossiping about Tucker’s marriage, telling others it was “on the rocks.” Tucker said he was “devastated” because he had confided in Tracy about his marital problems, and he believed she had discussed them with Alvarado.
Tucker confronted Tracy about the alleged gossiping during the Aug. 2 phone call, they both told the investigator. Tracy said he berated and bullied her, repeatedly saying he could not trust her. She said she told him she did not know what he was talking about.
Alvarado – who was killed in a car crash in June – would deny discussing Tucker’s marriage with anyone in her January interview with Veidlinger. 
During the Aug. 2 call, Tracy said she pressed Tucker to identify his source – the associate. She told Veidlinger she believed Tucker had made it up as a pretext for canceling her visit and ending her relationship with the school.
Veidlinger also asked Tucker to reveal the source of his claim, but he refused to say. In her report, she wrote that he said he had “given (his) word that (he) wouldn’t divulge their name.” 
Tucker never revealed the associate’s name to the investigator, nor did he identify anyone who could support his version of events. In his Sept. 11 public statement, however, he lamented that the hearing would not afford him the opportunity to “offer any substantive evidence of innocence.”
It was not the only claim he attributed to his anonymous associate. In his interview, he said that same person told him that ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating how Tracy “goes about her business” by claiming to be a rape survivor.  
Tucker said this further caused him to believe Tracy was untrustworthy because she believed Lavigne was her friend but didn’t know she was investigating the rape story at the center of her public persona. 
It turned out to be yet another falsehood.
Reached by USA TODAY, Lavigne said in an emailed statement that she was “perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.” She said Tracy has been a source of information for her for several years, and that she has featured Tracy’s comments and advocacy work in multiple news stories.
“That has been the extent of my reporting on Tracy and her organization,” Lavigne wrote. “Neither the organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting.”
Asked who might have told Tucker this misinformation, Lavigne responded, “I have absolutely no idea who would have alleged this to anyone.”

The bullets came in plywood crates. 
Any given box was about the size of a small microwave oven. The printed label stuck to each one demonstrated a militaristic brevity. “CARTRIDGES FOR WEAPONS, INERT PROJECTILE,” next to a bright yellow hazmat sticker, “EXPLOSIVES.” 
Inside the boxes: drab green steel cans of .50-caliber ammunition. Each round was giant, more than 5 inches long, built to be fired from a gun so big it is typically bolted to a truck. The bullets were clipped together in long strands for rapid, machine-gun fire. 
By the time Bill Brown got to the boxes, they sat double-stacked eight high atop wooden pallets inside a Missouri warehouse. The pallets went on, row after row. Three million bullets in all. 
It was enough ammunition to feed a single machine gun – if fired nonstop at its rated speed eight hours a day, seven days a week – for almost six months. 
Brown’s job was to get it out of there and toward the Ukrainian front lines. The faster, the better. 
“War is bad,” Brown said. “Loss of life is bad. But at the end of the day, it’s very profitable and injects revenue into this military industrial base.”
There would be virtually no public record of this Ukrainian arms shipment. As a weapons dealer, Brown’s company would deliver the bullets under a system known as a direct commercial sale. The ammunition required a State Department signoff – but the secret deal would never appear in a White House announcement or the Congressional Record. 
Instead, it was part of a shadowy system of brokers, exporters, arms dealers and country-to-country transfers that has become one part of the race to meet demand on distant battlefields. 
Western weaponry fueled Ukraine’s summertime counteroffensive along a 600-mile front. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the effort was delayed in part by the wait for more arms. Amid concerns about that slowly progessing counteroffensive, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday with a promise of up to $175 million more in military equipment. 
Most of America’s $44 billion in documented support to Ukraine came in the form of old U.S. military stock, donated directly by the federal government. In general, commercial sales over $14 million, and sales of military-grade weaponry like mortars or missiles, require State Department approval and congressional notification.
But other aid comes via private sales. 
More than 14,000 U.S. entities are registered to conduct defense trade activities. Their deals are monitored by an alphabet soup of agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Trade secrecy clauses in federal law mean this flow of gear, weapons and ammunition is almost never revealed to the public.
Brown, who works for a small Nevada-based logistics company called Battle Born Munitions, provided USA TODAY with a rare look behind the curtain of these private sales. Details about the shipment were verified by his employer and the European government that made the purchase. State Department officials declined to answer questions about the specific shipment Brown described.
This March sale and the secret number of other shipments like it fuel Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion. Those sales also release an unknown amount of weaponry into the world. What becomes of that weaponry after it’s sold – and especially after it’s delivered – is difficult to track. 
As Brown surveyed the warehouse in Missouri, a crew steered forklifts and skid lifts among the stacks of plain wooden boxes. From high in the trusses, suspended lamp fixtures bathed the boxes in artificial daylight. Brown lifted his camera and started snapping photos. 
In just a few hours, he and his cargo would be boarding a jumbo jet. Three million bullets would climb to the stratosphere and hurtle across the north Atlantic toward a European dawn.
From Ukraine:War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented. So is the country's push for swift justice.
The bullets had once been bound for Saudi Arabia. 
Lot number SMQ19K401L026 had rolled off the assembly line in 2019 at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Kansas City. Lake City, owned by the government and run by a contractor, sprawls across nearly 4,000 acres of green Missouri farmland. Roads curve past World War II-era bunkers known as igloos, spaced out amid the countryside – far enough apart that an explosion in one won’t trigger a chain reaction in the others.
Lake City has been pumping out ammunition almost without pause since 1941. It is the largest small-arms manufacturing plant in the world.
Today the plant is run by Olin-Winchester, but in 2019, the bullets were made by some of the 1,700 workers employed by Northrop Grumman. And in 2019, Saudi Arabia was stocking up on weapons during the Trump administration, fueling the war in Yemen and other conflicts that drew criticism from congressional Democrats.
The plant manufactures .50-caliber ammunition on a rolling basis, for both military and commercial buyers. That’s a testament to just what a legend the bullet – and the gun that shoots it – has become.
In 2019, the technology was already a century old. The .50 caliber was the brainchild of American gunsmith John Browning during World War I. Built to respond to German anti-tank rifles, the M2 was first tested in 1918, and it entered widespread service in 1923. It earned the nickname “Ma Deuce” and has served in combat ever since, bolted to trucks, ships, planes and handheld stands on the battlefield.
The .50-caliber rounds – named for their diameter, about half an inch – can easily hit targets more than a mile away. At closer ranges, they will blast through solid concrete or armored vehicles. The gun can fire at a sustained rate of about 40 shots per minute.
Military setups use strings of “linked” ammunition to feed into machine guns. Spaced out after every fourth bullet, so-called tracer rounds have small pyrotechnic charges that illuminate the line of fire, aiding in targeting.
The gun’s longevity and versatility made it popular for militaries the world over. But this particular batch of bullets wouldn’t end up being sold to Saudi Arabia. 
The Biden administration put a temporary freeze on sales to the Saudi government in 2021 as it reviewed weapons deals approved under Donald Trump. Instead, Brown said, the bullets were sold to a U.S. ammunition provider, only to be held up again. Ultimately, they were mothballed. 
Then, in spring 2023, the bullets found a buyer, or actually two: first Battle Born; ultimately, the Netherlands. 
The European country, a NATO ally, needed a big supply of ammunition. It wouldn’t be keeping the bullets but giving them to Ukraine. Its purchase, essentially a donation, would count toward the country’s required NATO contribution. 
Brown had a line on exactly what they needed. It was sitting in the warehouse in Missouri. 
He arrived in March to personally oversee the shipment. As he prepped for delivery, Brown dropped tiny black tracking devices onto several of the pallets. Just $55 apiece, the units use GPS and cell signals to keep tabs on the load. The idea was to ensure it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands. 
But packing up the bullets was just the beginning. As with anything that’s deadly and made of metal, the shipping costs can be extreme. 
Brown said the question for the buyer was simple: “How fast do you want it? Forty-five to 60 days on a ship? Or in five days if I fly it?”
Brown – or Chief Bill, as he prefers – is a no-nonsense 35-year veteran of the U.S. Army and former helicopter pilot. He retired as a chief warrant officer and lives in Orlando. 
Now 59, he still spends a lot of time on the road – 10 international trips this year. He says his arms logistics work takes him to places most Americans would rather avoid – near the Syrian border or to unstable regions of Iraq.
He’ll travel halfway around the world, he quips, “have some soup, and go back to Warsaw to head home.” The trips aren’t really about the destinations. They’re about the cargo. 
On that spring day in Missouri, forklifts carefully loaded 107 pallets of the ammo onto 18 flatbed semitrailers. They’d all make the eight-hour drive to O’Hare International Airport. 
In Chicago, two Boeing 747-400s operated by National Airlines would be ready for the freight. 
Four pallets each were stacked and shrink-wrapped to create “air pallets” or “cookie sheets” weighing 12,800 pounds. Each plane could carry up to 17 of the pallets that ran the length of each plane secured by white cargo netting.
Flight records Brown provided show the two planes departed about seven hours apart, one in early afternoon, one after dark. 
The flight would take nine hours. Brown wasn’t going to the Netherlands, even though it was the buyer. The planes were bound for Rzeszów, Poland. 
The ancient city sits at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland. It has a gleaming modern airport next to a major east-west freeway. From there, it’s barely 60 miles to the border with Ukraine. 
It was an expensive journey. The trucking company’s bill for those 18 semis? $85,000. Chartering the two 747s? $625,000. Each.
But this shipment of .50-cal rounds was profitable for Battle Born Munitions, according to Brown.
The company purchased the 3 million rounds from Northrop Grumman at a bargain and resold them for more than double the price. (In subsequent interviews, representatives at BBM disputed the specific totals Brown mentioned, saying the accurate figures were protected by “various commercial and government non-disclosure agreements.” They did not dispute the other specifics of the deal he provided.) 
Retail prices for .50-caliber ammunition run roughly $5 per bullet. At that rate, the whole shipment would have been worth $15 million.
The pricing might also be elastic. The Dutch mark up the price of the bullets and count it toward their NATO contribution, pegged to a percentage of gross domestic product, Brown said. The Netherlands has contributed about $15 billion to NATO this year, or about 1.7% of its GDP and just under the NATO mandate of 2%.
Representatives of the Dutch military confirmed the shipment to USA TODAY but declined to comment further about the pricing or details.
The war in Ukraine has only increased the demand for private deals. The State Department signed off on more than $154 billion in commercial arms deals directly to foreign countries in 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year. 
Direct commercial sales represent a modest portion of the contribution to Ukraine compared with the $44 billion donated by the U.S., but they still amounted to more than $600 million in sales from U.S. companies to the Ukrainian government last year alone. That doesn’t include sales to other countries that also support Ukraine – sales like the one Brown described.
Jim Bartlett, an attorney with expertise in the specialized international arms transactions, said private U.S. businesses are playing a small but important role in the conflict.
“American companies are happy to export defense articles to foreign buyers approved by the U.S. State Department,” Bartlett said. “There’s an effort at the State Department to quickly clear the ones headed for Ukraine. … You get head-of-the-line privileges.”
Those sales also come with risks. 
Direct sales face fewer regulatory controls, oversight and enforcement, said Robert Nichols, an international military sales expert and attorney at the law firm Nichols Liu.
“You can imagine the range of characters involved in supplying a war effort,” Nichols said. “Some are highly credible. Others will skirt the law and sometimes step over the line by paying bribes, committing fraud and hiding their transactions.” 
So far, the Department of Justice has indicted just a handful of arms brokers over deals related to the war in Ukraine. Court records show the government has charged Miami-based Oleg Patsulya and Vasilii Besedin with illegally attempting to sell American-made aircraft parts to Russia. They allegedly lied to Commerce Department agents and told them the parts were bound for Turkey. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges this summer. 
A State Department spokesman declined to provide details of enforcement actions but said, “The United States takes seriously our responsibility to protect American military and dual-use technologies and prevent their diversion, including through strong enforcement actions.”
NATO said it oversees allied arms deliveries, and that those arms generally reach Ukraine. NATO itself technically only provides non-non-lethal aid, like fuel, medical supplies and generators.
Brown, of Battle Born, says he fields calls weekly from “clowns” without the proper licensing, whom he reports to the State Department for potential violations. Some raise red flags when they approach him about transactions that include payment via diamonds or gold.
He prefers traditional wire transfers with approved sales partners since he knows government officials are watching. He validates the contracts and checks certificates for the final users. That’s part of why he traveled with the ammunition. He would be meeting a Dutch military official for the official handoff.
“My job is to keep us all out of jail,” Brown said. 
The two 747s touched down in Poland, one before the sun, the other in late morning. Brown exchanged paperwork with a young Dutch military staffer who signed for the delivery, he said. They traded military patches as souvenirs. They snapped a photo together. 
The bullets bought by the Netherlands would never touch Dutch soil. 
U.S. aid:Billions from the US flows to Ukraine. Here's where it comes from, and how it adds up
Despite playing a small role proportionately in the war, $600 million in direct commercial sales can buy a lot of small weaponry. 
And those weapons are the kind most apt to fall into illicit use, said Elias Yousif, a research analyst at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit think tank.
Put another way: It’s hard to sneak away an F-16 or a missile launcher the size of a tractor-trailer. But a bunch of guns or a pallet of ammo? Much easier to resell. 
“In the commercial sector, especially in a new market, the risk increases,” Yousif said.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss arms research project, estimated that within a year, battlefield seizures and other forms of diversion led to 300,000 small arms and light weapons going missing, including 100,000 in Crimea alone.
When small arms go missing, they can go missing into another country, maybe one led by a despot or even a terrorist organization.
The U.S. government says diversion of American donations has been widely absent so far in Ukraine. That could be a combination of intensive “end-use-monitoring” programs and the reality of the battlefield, where supplies are rapidly put to use.
But even if not now, unused ammo could be resold someday. 
“History shows us this isn’t a short-term issue,” Yousif said.  “These are commodities with very long shelf lives.” 
Florida-based Global Ordnance, another State Department-licensed exporter, is a competitor in the direct weapons sales business. General counsel Bryan Van Brunt said the company has extensive protocols in place to track shipments and make sure the end-users are federally approved, though he declined to provide specifics about those systems. 
Brown, with Battle Born Munitions, says the company employs a mix of simple and sophisticated tracking technology to ensure his shipments are tracked to end users. The black GPS devices he dropped onto his cargo tracked the ammo all the way across the globe.
But that system only works as long as Brown is actually tracking. “Technically, my role ends when I deliver it to NATO,” he said.
Sometime after the 747s touched down in Poland, along with signing the paperwork and snapping a selfie with the Dutch official, Brown found the tiny black GPS trackers and lifted them off the pallets. 
Ukrainian trucks would arrive at the airport to pick up the ammunition. They would point toward the border, and onward to Lviv, and some distant battlefield. 
Brown would point in the opposite direction. Just like one of his quips: Fly in, have soup, get home. He headed toward Warsaw, with the GPS trackers in his bag.

The geography professor didn’t hide his clown fetish or the fact that he sometimes indulged his urges by recruiting students as subjects. He posted regularly about it on social media.
“I have a facepaint fetish and convince the cute girls in my classes to let me paint their faces,” he once wrote.
Yet Joseph Tokosh held jobs at two colleges and was on the tenure track at a third before student journalists at Nicholls State University in Louisiana exposed his behavior. He submitted his resignation the same day their story was published.
His interactions with students and open discussion of his fetish happened in both mainstream and tailored digital spaces. He popped into Facebook groups geared toward new students and niche forums on websites like Reddit. He posted videos on YouTube. In one Reddit post on a forum meant to highlight hard-to-believe stories, Tokosh posted pictures of several women in white face paint.
Over the years, two students reported him to campus police; others complained online. He left Kent State University after pleading no contest to something different: a theft charge that involved entering his peers’ offices without permission and taking a USB drive. Tokosh has not been charged with any other crime.
Tokosh’s career trajectory exposes inadequacies in the background check system that colleges and universities are supposed to have in place to protect students – especially when evidence of the concerning behavior resides largely on the internet. Nicholls State, for example, told USA TODAY Network reporters it does not routinely check social media for new hires.
A federal law intended to ensure the academic privacy of students also makes it difficult to determine how Tokosh was able to move so freely from campus to campus. Both Kent State and Northern Illinois University – where he taught while finishing his doctorate – noted Tokosh’s protected status as a graduate student in declining to answer questions.
Sophie Levan was a freshman at Kent State in 2017 when she encountered Tokosh, then 28, in a Facebook group intended as a gathering place for new students. Tokosh had offered cash to anyone willing to let him paint their faces. Levan, then 18, agreed.
The money was appealing but the interactions soured. 
Tokosh, she said, insisted he come pick her up and take her to the building that housed the geography department, where he would paint her face. Uneasy, Levan stopped responding. Tokosh got angry and wouldn’t give up, she said, which led her to file a police report.
“I felt like the school would want to know about it,” Levan said. “I thought maybe they could prevent anything bad from happening since other girls would go with him.”
She said there was never any followup from campus police – or anyone else.
USA TODAY Network reporters reviewed the experiences of six students who were the subject of Tokosh’s attention going back to his time at Kent State.
In addition to Levan, the other person who reported Tokosh to campus police could not be reached for comment. The two who expressed public concerns on social media told USA TODAY they never heard from their campus officials either.
USA TODAY attempted to reach Tokosh via phone, social media and a certified letter. A person answered a phone call to a number associated with Tokosh, but he hung up after the reporter identified himself. A reporter also reached someone who identified herself as Tokosh’s mother. She said she would pass along that reporters were trying to reach him.
Tokosh told the Nicholls student journalists that he did have an assignment where students were required to paint their faces as part of a cultural exercise. Prior to the article in the student newspaper The Nicholls Worth, the university had already cut Tokosh loose. He said his contract was not renewed because he was the target of a “grade inflation task force.”
The university, however, “does not have any such task force,” according to Nicholls spokesman Jerad David.
Tokosh also told students the face painting was a requirement in his cultural geography class to better understand other cultures. In a video interview with Hannah Robert, the station manager for the student-run KNSU TV, he says: “That's an assignment in one of my classes where they actually come up with their own face paint and makeup design inspired by a culture and they implement it.”
It’s a well-established trend in the academic world for professors to bounce from one institution to another without having to disclose why they left their last post, said Julie Libarkin, an associate dean at Michigan State University. She has seen the pattern often in her work maintaining a database of publicly documented sexual misconduct by faculty and staff.
As for grad students? Libarkin said people have requested she add them to her list, but universities’ conservative interpretations of the law get in the way.
“I don’t on purpose,” she said, “because that’s information that almost never comes out.”
Tokosh arrived at Kent State in 2015 with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in geography from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, according to his curriculum vitae. He was working toward his doctorate and researched fading businesses. His work about shopping malls in the Rust Belt won several awards. Like many graduate students, he also taught classes.
Then, Tokosh started showing up in the Facebook groups for new students. In a December 2017 post, an account under the name “Joe Tokosh” posted several pictures of women made up to look like clowns or skulls.
“If anyone is looking for some extra cash, I am looking for people to practice facepainting on!” he wrote. “I will literally pay you!”
Those are the types of posts that caught Levan’s eye. Not only was she pressed for cash, she was interested in movie makeup and thought the face painting could be fun based on the photos Tokosh had posted. But Levan said she soon realized that those images were stock photos and not representative of what Tokosh could do.
What’s more, she figured out that he was a graduate student, a fact she said he didn’t disclose in his posts.
When Tokosh offered to pick her up from her dorm, she refused. But, she said, Tokosh kept insisting she agreed to participate. Levan stopped responding to his messages and filed a police report with the Kent State police in January 2018. They advised her only to stop talking to Tokosh, she said, and let them know if “anything of consequence occurred.”
Months after she refused to meet up and filed the police report, Tokosh texted a picture of himself wearing white face paint to her cellphone. It arrived at midnight and contained no message, although writing on his shirt read: “I'm not a failure.”  
“There was some negative intention with sending that photo,” Levan said. “It’s definitely burned into my mind.”
What Levan didn’t know is that campus police had been put on notice a year earlier when another student filed a similar report. That student told police Tokosh reached out to her and her friends after they posted their numbers on a Facebook group for undergraduates. He would send “get to know you” messages, the police report said, and then ask the student if she was “interested in having her face painted for one of his class projects.”
When she found out Tokosh was a graduate student, she said no and eventually blocked him on Facebook and Snapchat, according to the report. Tokosh continued to text her.
“She does not have any concerns for her safety, but just wanted this documented,” the police report read. 
In July 2017, another student had retweeted a message from Kent State’s Twitter account that asked for Kent State love stories. She wrote: “A geography professor requested me on facebook and asked if he could paint my face like a clown.”
The student confirmed to USA TODAY that the professor was Tokosh and shared a screenshot of a Facebook friend request he sent her. She said she suspected Tokosh also found her on a freshman Facebook group because she posted there often.
She said she tweeted to draw officials’ attention to it and moved on but now wishes she had reported it officially.
College campuses are supposed to offer students special protections from sexual harassment even when it falls short of criminal behavior. Title IX, often associated with equity in women’s sports, also addresses “sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence” at schools that receive federal funding.
Colleges infrequently and unevenly enforce the rule, however. A 2022 USA TODAY investigation found just one of every 12,400 students was suspended in connection with sexual misconduct.
The student who shared her story online said the only response she received was from a graduate student in the geography department, who contacted her on Oct. 1, 2018. In an email, he wrote that he had seen her post and suspected he knew which faculty member had asked her about face painting.
“I brought it to the attention of some of our faculty because I was pretty sure I knew who it was, but they were certain it wasn’t that individual and that you probably just meant geology,” he wrote. 
He went on to reference another student being “approached in (at least by just looking at your tweet) a much more aggressive way.” The grad student asked the undergraduate for more information, but, she told USA TODAY, she didn’t respond. She said she started drafting a reply, but a year had passed. She wanted to move on.
Kent State would not say whether any actions were taken after the students’ reports, but Eric Mansfield, a spokesman for the university, said the police department confirmed that the students who filed police reports were provided with “university resources, which would include other non-criminal avenues to pursue (Counseling Services, Title IX, Center for Sexual and Relationship Violence Services, etc.) as a general police practice.”
Levan does not recall police offering her services, but she said she didn’t want counseling. She wanted Tokosh investigated.
Mansfield also said that the university monitors social media but that colleges “can’t always see or track every mention on social media.”
Police records show that officers did investigate when Tokosh was accused of breaking into geography department offices. A blotter item in the local newspaper shows police obtained an arrest warrant in connection with a third-degree felony burglary charge. Court documents indicate Tokosh pleaded no contest to a theft on Oct. 19, 2018.
Kent State would not explain what led to Tokosh’s departure during that fall semester. Instead, the university said that since Tokosh was a graduate student, any information about him was protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It also would not say whether school officials shared Tokosh’s disciplinary record with other colleges or even if it was standard practice to do so for grad students.
“Due to FERPA, student education records are private,” said Emily Vincent, a university spokeswoman. “Also, we do not comment on personnel matters.”
When Congress passed FERPA in 1974, its author, Sen. James L. Buckley of New York, said the intent was to protect the academic privacy of students and their families. In more recent years, Buckley has become critical of the law and how schools interpret it. He told the Columbus Dispatch in 2010 that “the law needs to be revamped.”
Survivors of sexual violence and students accuse universities of using the law to avoid negative media coverage. Students with a history of bad behavior may jump from one school to another without the public ever knowing about their histories. Law enforcement records don’t fall under FERPA’s purview, but a wide variety of questionable behavior does.
One case involved Brandon Austin, who was accused of sexual assault at Providence College in 2013 while on the school’s basketball team. But Providence College initially said Austin was suspended for violating the school’s code of student conduct and declined to share further details with the Providence Journal, citing federal privacy laws. Austin denied wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime. 
Austin was able to transfer to the University of Oregon, where he was again accused of sexual assault, along with other players. Police investigated the claims, and the local district attorney declined to press charges. The university expelled him anyway but raised FERPA when it declined to release records showing what Oregon knew about the allegations, according to the Oregonian.
LeRoy Rooker was the director of the U.S. Education Department office that oversaw FERPA for more than two decades. Rooker, now a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said FERPA is not a confidentiality law – it is focused on education records. And it doesn’t apply when a student is “seeking or intending to enroll” at another college.
Therefore, Rooker said, Kent State could have shared information about Tokosh with Northern Illinois.
Rooker also said FERPA would not have prevented Kent State from telling reporters if other universities had inquired about Tokosh, though they could not have disclosed what they shared.
He blamed the overuse of the law on fear of being sued.
“In this litigious age, institutions get a little wonky about whether they will forward, say, disciplinary records,” Rooker said. “On the other hand, if you have something and you don’t share it when you can and something happens at the next institution, I would say that’s a big liability.”
Backgrounding job applicants has become increasingly complex.
While most U.S. employers conduct background screening, according to trade group data, those inquiries typically focus on criminal history. Social media receives far less attention even though that is where people are most likely to share their unguarded thoughts.
Undertaking a full review of a person’s social media presence is more difficult than just checking an applicant’s Facebook page.
Does an applicant have an account on X, formerly Twitter? How about an account with Discord, an online platform frequented by gamers, where leaked Pentagon documents were recently shared? Or what about a Telegram account, a messaging platform popular among white nationalists? Further complicating things, it’s common on sites like Reddit for users to adopt usernames and describe experiences with little to no ties to reality.
A little digging, however, can turn up a lot of dirt.  
Tokosh has a LinkedIn page that includes his teaching stints at Northern Illinois University and Nicholls State University. His time as a student and instructor at Kent State is absent.
For LinkedIn, a custom URL includes a play on his name and his chosen field of study: Joeography. Tokosh would later use that moniker in promotional materials for a class at Nicholls State. That is the same handle used on Reddit by someone with a special interest in face paint.
One post features a video of Tokosh throwing a pie at someone. Other posts mention a “clown fetish.” In a forum titled “Creepy,” he wrote, “I convince pretty girls to let me paint their faces,” along with a photo with multiple women in white face paint.
That and other similar posts remained live for years until they were taken down after the Nicholls students published their story in late March.
USA TODAY Network reporters captured screenshots before they disappeared. With dates in 2019, the posts feature a young woman wearing a Kent State T-shirt. The material would have been available to administrators at Northern Illinois before the start of the fall 2019 semester.
Joe King, a spokesman for Northern Illinois, said departments hiring new graduate students are “not required to check social media or investigate a disciplinary history.” He added some departments may reach out to the graduate students’ former advisers.
King said he could not determine if the university was aware of Tokosh’s behavior at Kent State. He said that due to FERPA, he could not share specifics about Tokosh’s time at Northern Illinois, including whether students had complained about him.
But there are signs the behavior continued.
A YouTube account under the name “Joe Tokosh” included at least two videos in 2020 of a man throwing pies at women. One of the videos features a young woman also seen in the screenshots from Tokosh’s Reddit account. 
Comments on one from October 2020 read: “You can have a video of her tied up getting pied via cash app.” That video was viewed more than 30,000 times before it was turned off in late July, around the time a USA TODAY reporter reached out to Tokosh.
A former Northern Illinois State student shared text messages exchanged with Tokosh in which he asked to paint her face on multiple occasions. USA TODAY has agreed not to name her because she is concerned Tokosh might retaliate against her.
In the text messages, Tokosh shared a photo of a young woman in white face paint – an image also posted to the Joeography Reddit account. She said she declined to do it but was aware that other Northern Illinois students had participated.
By fall 2022, when he had moved on to Nicholls, Tokosh revealed to the student that he had required students in his cultural geography class to paint their faces.  
The Northern Illinois student asked Tokosh what he did with the photos, and she said he suggested that he might spin them off into a research project someday. She asked, had anyone complained? She said Tokosh responded: Why would they?
Many students would find a reason to complain, as Nicholls State student journalist Sally-Anne Torres learned firsthand. It started in January when one of her fellow reporters picked up an odd rumor: a professor was offering extra credit for students willing to paint their faces like clowns. Initially, Torres dismissed it because it seemed too unusual and there weren’t a lot of leads to follow. 
By Feb. 7, university administrators informed Tokosh that his contract would not be renewed, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY via a records request. They gave no reason for the nonrenewal, but on Feb. 12, Tokosh emailed his students that the university was letting him go. He blamed his departure on giving too many A’s.
That seemed suspicious to Torres. 
During her reporting, she received a tip about Tokosh’s Reddit posts in which he wrote of his “clown fetish” and how he enlisted his students to participate in it.
“It wasn’t just this innocent thing that a lot of these girls thought it was,” Torres said. “As a professor or teacher, that is somebody students are supposed to trust. He used his power to ruin that trust and to do these things, and that made me angry for them.”
Torres spoke to six students who shared their experiences with Tokosh. Some, she said, were followed on Twitter by him while others opted into an extra credit assignment he offered.
The women told Torres he sometimes giggled and laughed as they painted their faces in his office.
On March 27, the Nicholls Worth published a story headlined, “Geography professor suspended immediately, students allege sexual harassment.” KNSU TV, a student broadcast network, also aired footage in which Tokosh defended the assignment on camera. That same day, Tokosh submitted his resignation.
The story’s publication prompted other students to come forward about Tokosh and their frustration with the university.
Bradley Price took an online class with Tokosh and said the professor required students to photograph themselves with their faces painted. Price said Tokosh told them the assignment was to help them understand Japanese culture, but then Tokosh offered him bonus points if he could get a female friend to paint her face.
It seemed unusual at the time, Price said, because his friend wasn’t in the class. It became more concerning to him on reading the student newspaper’s report.
“I feel frankly disgusted and disappointed that Nicholls couldn’t do a proper background check on this professor, because this is unacceptable,” Price said. 
Bella Ramos, a junior at Nicholls State who did not take any of Tokosh’s classes, told USA TODAY that someone using the handle @Joeography21 followed her on Twitter in late 2021 and started liking all her selfies.
Ramos learned that the person behind the account was likely a professor at the university. She posted about the behavior in January 2022, but nothing came of it. She also found the Joeography Reddit account. On March 27, the same day the student newspaper published its piece, Ramos posted screenshots of her discoveries on Twitter with the message, “Found a Nicholls state university professor on Reddit.”
“I wish the university had acted sooner because all this information was public on the internet,” she told USA TODAY. 
No one from the university, she said, has ever reached out.

CORALVILLE — U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, standing on the bed of a bright red truck, delivered a passionate defense of her votes opposing U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan's bid for House speaker — a high-profile break from the majority of House Republicans that she said spawned death threats against her.
“I am never going to quit fighting for Iowa, and I am never going to quit fighting for this country," Miller-Meeks yelled at her annual fundraiser event Friday night. "So if you think you can intimidate me, go … suck it up, buttercup!"
Washington, D.C., was gridlocked this week as House Republicans failed to elect a new speaker. The caucus nominated Jordan, an ultraconservative representative from Ohio.
In the first round of votes, Miller-Meeks and the other three members in Iowa's delegation cast their votes for Jordan — but holdouts from 20 Republicans tanked Jordan's bid. Miller-Meeks explained Friday that she voted to Jordan out of respect for a House rule that members vote on the floor for whoever gets the majority vote in a closed-door conference.
But, she told reporters, she had concerns about whether Jordan could unify the party, and she was worried about the looming threat of a government shutdown.
"I wanted assurances that Republican members of Congress were not going to be attacking other Republicans," Miller-Meeks said. "As soon as the vote was had in conference, and then, not two hours later, we had that coming out."
In the second round of votes on Wednesday, Miller-Meeks withdrew her support for Jordan. She cast her vote Wednesday for U.S. Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, a Republican who chairs the Appropriations Committee.
"Since my vote in support of Chairwoman Granger, I have received credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls," Miller-Meeks said in a statement Wednesday night. "The proper authorities have been notified and my office is cooperating fully."
On Friday, Jordan lost a third floor vote for speaker, with Iowa's delegation voting for him except for Miller-Meeks. Jordan then lost a secret ballot and withdrew his nomination.
Miller-Meeks did not mention the death threats specifically during her speech Friday, but she delivered a passionate defense of her Congressional record.
“I’m not a Democrat. I am a proud Republican," Miller-Meeks said. "Why do I want to get appropriations bills across? … It’s because every one of those appropriations bills has Republican priorities and Republican policies."
Miller-Meeks thanked her office staff for dealing with a "very stressful week." She anticipates House Republicans will successfully choose a speaker "next week."
"We had a vote for speaker, and then I had to rush here to make my own tailgate. And so, there are candidates who have thrown their name into the ring," Miller-Meeks told reporters. "I have told everybody I’m not doing anything until Sunday."

The latest guilty pleas from two key allies in Donald Trump's high-profile Georgia election interference case put new pressure on the former president and raise questions about whether his once-loyal associates may one day flip on him.
Two attorneys, Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell, pleaded guilty to related crimes this week and agreed to testify against other defendants. They had been charged with playing separate roles in an alleged multi-pronged conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Coming after a third defendant, Scott Hall, pleaded guilty in September, their deals bolster the weapons in prosecutors' toolbox, and may pressure other defendants to flip -- a move that would raise the legal stakes for Trump.
''Once you get a couple people pleading, it starts sort of an avalanche of pleas," said Chandelle Summer, a Georgia attorney who previously worked as both a prosecutor and public defender in the state.
In addition to agreeing to testify, Chesebro, Powell, and Hall will turn over relevant documents to the state of Georgia, and are prohibited from communicating with witnesses or defendants in the case.
Norman Eisen, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2020, said information from the three former Trump associates, could bolster the government's evidence in another pending Trump trial -- federal election meddling case, which is scheduled to start in March in Washington.
"Both Powell and Chesebro were unindicted co-conspirators in the federal case, so they're central to it," Eisen said. "It is ominous for the other defendants in the state or federal cases, above all Donald Trump."
Chesebro, an election lawyer, pleaded guilty Friday in the Fulton County Superior Court to a felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. Chesebro offers an inside view of the development of the scheme to recruit fake presidential electors to vote for Trump in states that President Joe Biden won.
Chesebro created and distributed false documents in Georgia and other states for people to submit to the National Archives and Congress posing as presidential electors, according to Daysha Young, the executive district attorney in Fulton County.
"The defendant provided detailed instructions to co-conspirators in Georgia and other states for creating and distributing these false documents," she said.
Chesebro's deal gets the prosecution closer to John Eastman, who around that time appears to have been in "constant communication" with Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump, said Melissa Redmon, a former Fulton County prosecutor who directs the University of Georgia School of Law's Prosecutorial Justice Program.
Those connections will help the state paint a picture for the jury of the false elector activity being ultimately motivated by a desire to make sure Trump retained the presidency "by any means necessary," Redmon said.
Sixteen co-defendants in the Georgia case, including Trump, Eastman and Giuliani, have pleaded not guilty.
Powell, an election lawyer who spread baseless claims of voter fraud, pleaded guilty Thursday to a half-dozen misdemeanors associated with tampering with election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia.
Legal experts said Powell's agreement to provide testimony could have a weighty impact on the wider case because she had significant dealings with Trump, Giuliani, and others.
Powell can also describe how co-defendants tried to overturn the 2020 election. She and Giuliani attended a raucous meeting at the White House with Trump, where they discussed having the military seize voting machines. Trump never acted on the proposal.
Hall, a bail bondsman who served as a go-between for several of the co-defendants, pleaded guilty in September to five misdemeanors dealing with interfering with election duties.
Hall helped SullivanStrickler employees tamper with the Coffee County equipment.
Hall also made multiple calls to co-defendants in the case. For example, Hall spoke with Jeffrey Clark, a former assistant attorney general, for more than an hour Jan. 2, 2021, according to the indictment.
Clark, who pleaded not guilty, is charged with drafting a letter of false statements about Justice Department concerns with the 2020 election, to be sent to Georgia officials. Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to sign or send the letter.
Hall also spoke repeatedly with co-defendants accused of trying to intimidate election workers to change their stories about what happened with ballot counting at State Farm Arena on election night 2020.
Although the pleas open up several months on McAfee's calendar that had been reserved for Powell and Chesebro's trial, Redmon said typically in Fulton County there are several steps involving pre-trial deadlines before a trial date is set in a case, and she doesn't expect to see a trial date for Trump soon.
Summer said McAfee would have to take the schedules for Trump's other criminal trials into account, as well as his attorneys' scheduling conflicts.
"Assuming he's acquitted in the DC case, I think then they'll probably specially set a trial for sometime after that, maybe the fall of 2024," she said.
Eisen suggested McAfee might aim to hold Trump's Georgia trial sooner.
"If Chesebro and Powell could get ready for trial on an accelerated basis, surely it's not too unreasonable for Trump and possibly other defendants to prepare themselves to face a jury in Atlanta at some point in the coming months," Eisen said.
Who could benefit the most from Biden’s latest attempt at student loan forgiveness?
Undergraduates at public two-year colleges might be in the best position – if the administration’s new policy holding predatory colleges more accountable goes as planned, that is. 
And borrowers who earn certificates, rather than four-year degrees, using the new income-driven repayment plan will have to pay back only about a third, on average, of what they borrowed. 
Those findings were laid out in a research analysis published this week by the Urban Institute, a social and economic policy think tank. The report uses data from the College Scorecard, an online Education Department tool that lets consumers compare colleges, to determine what loan repayment might look like under the policy revision dubbed by the administration "Saving on A Valuable Education," or SAVE. The system bases monthly loan repayments on borrowers' incomes and family sizes, according to the Education Department, lowering payments for almost everyone who participates.
Income-driven repayment is not a new concept, but Education Secretary Miguel Cardona has referred to the newest iteration of the program as the “most affordable repayment plan ever.” For some borrowers, it will reduce monthly payments to $0. More than 4 million borrowers have already enrolled, and it will be fully available to all federal student-loan borrowers starting July 1, 2024. 
Saving the SAVE student loan plan:Education Department works to rally support for Biden's SAVE student loan repayment plan
Undergraduates are in luck, the report says. Nearly all the largest undergraduate fields in the country will see a decrease in the number of programs in which borrowers typically repay their loans in full. 
Yet the plan, according to researchers, is less likely to increase the already large benefits for typical graduate borrowers, who have historically benefited disproportionately compared with undergrads from income-driven repayment plans. Graduate students on average take out more loans than undergraduates, and a 2020 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office showed they received the most help from income-based programs.  
Undergraduate psychology programs could also see an easier path to repayment, according to the report. Under current income-driven repayment policies, nearly 100% of programs require such borrowers to fully repay, the report says. That number will drop to a little more than a quarter of programs under SAVE. The program seems to be good news for borrowers pursuing humanities and teaching degrees, too.
Millions plan to use Biden's SAVE planto cut student loan payments even as some in GOP try to stop it
A smaller difference, the researchers suggest, is expected for borrowers pursuing degrees in engineering, finance or registered nursing. In those fields, most undergraduate programs based on income already require the typical borrower to fully repay their loans. That doesn’t seem likely to change, at least not significantly, because those borrowers generally go on to higher-paying jobs.
When it comes to the SAVE rollout, one big question mark will be the implications of the Biden administration’s efforts to crack down on predatory colleges, according to Jason Cohn, a research analyst at the Urban Institute and one of the authors of the report.
The analysis, for instance, predicts the highest loan forgiveness rate under SAVE will be at public two-year institutions. But it's a conclusion that can only be made after excluding programs likely to fail new accountability metrics rolled out last month by the Education Department.
Without the new so-called "gainful employment" rule, Cohn told USA TODAY, the highest forgiveness rate could actually be at for-profit institutions. 
“A lot of it really comes down to how institutions and students see this issue, how this information gets spread, and also how accountability efforts play out,” he said.

A grocery store in Petersburg, Alaska had an unexpected customer Tuesday, leaving store employees and other shoppers in shock.
A black bear cub was spotted roaming the produce aisle at the Petersburg's Trading Union IGA, scaring customers, Alaska News Source reported.
Alaska State Troopers, two wildlife troopers and units from the Petersburg Police Department were called to the scene, where officers chased the cub through the aisles of fruits and vegetables with a steel catch pole, video footage from the incident shows. After some struggle, authorities were able to corner and catch the young cub where the shopping carts are stored.
The black bear was escorted out and loaded into the back of a trooper vehicle, after a lot of fuss and protest.

The bear cub unfortunately had to be euthanized, Justin Freeman, a public information officer with the Alaska State Troopers told USA TODAY.
Freeman said that the decision was made in coordination with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game for a variety of reasons.
"The bear was small and emaciated for this time of year," explained Freeman. "It did not have any measure of fat that would have sustained it through the winter. It was also abandoned, for unknown reasons, and therefore did not have any way to significantly acquire resources to recover from its condition."
The spokesperson further said that the bear would not likely be able to handle the stress of transportation to a holding facility, and no known facilities had placement for a black bear.

Meet Nanny McPhee, the British cat with two noses up for adoption across the pond.
Nanny, a 4-year-old black and white 'moggy' with a tan streak on her face and big hazel cat eyes is a rare breed. Or so the animal rescue sheltering her posted on social media Thursday.
One could guess, crafty shelter folks abroad named her after the fictional character Nanny McPhee, played by Actress Emma Thompson in the 2005 British self-titled film, Nanny McPhee, about a governess who "uses magic to rein in the behavior of seven ne'er-do-well children in her charge."
And has a very large noggin.

Nanny's double nose was caused by "a rare congenital abnormality," Cats Protection Warrington Adoption Centre in the United Kingdom posted on Facebook.
According to the World Health Organization, the disorders, also called birth defects, are structural or functional abnormalities present from birth in both humans and animals.
Although WHO said the disorders can contribute to long-term disability. the feline "thankfully has no long-term ill effects," the shelter said.
"Nanny McPhee is a gentle lady who loves fuss and a cuddle," the adoption center wrote.

Animal encounters can be magical, and at an aquarium in Gulfport, Mississippi, an adorable toddler had the experience of a lifetime when a baby dolphin stopped to chat.
Dolphins are said to be the most intelligent animals on the planet after humans. They're also extremely social. So, when Ryenn ran up to the glass to wave, the curious dolphin not only noticed the child but came over to share what looked like a real conversation.
Later, Ryenn's mom, Carly Keech, who filmed the encounter, said it "unlocked a new core memory" for her daughter.

A Southwest Airlines cabin crew family reunion, a sweet toddler meeting his newborn baby sister for the first time, and a pair of rambunctious grandma BFFs topped our Humankind stories of the week.
During a Southwest Airlines flight from Dallas, Texas, the pilot took a moment to inform passengers about a very special cabin crew on board. Air hostess Angel had been working for Southwest for 27 years. Now, for the first time, she was joined by her two daughters, Keleko and Jessica, on their first day at work with the airline. But that's not all– their father Gregg, a retired flight captain, was on board too!
In Sunset Beach, North Carolina, an 89-year-old grandma named Angela Timmerman was sitting in her room when she was startled by a surprise visitor — her best friend of over 60 years. 84-year-old Joann Flynn, who'd moved away to Newtown, Connecticut, had traveled back to see her. If that isn't a bestie, we don't know what is. Watch a surprise on a Southwest flight, a toddler meeting his baby sister, a sweet father-son driving lesson, and more on the week's Best of Humankind.
When two-year-old Matteo Clarke entered the hospital room where his newborn sister lay, he was in a hurry to see her. "Where's my sister?" he asked immediately as his mom greeted him. When Matteo finally got to see and hold the baby in his arms, his excitement at meeting his new best friend was palpable.
In Treemonton, Utah, 11-year-old Ezekial Zarate shared a priceless father-son moment with his dad. Spotting an empty lot on the way to work, Michael Zarate decided it was the perfect spot to teach his son how to drive. So, with his father in the passenger seat, Ezekial took the wheel. And the core memory is surely something the 11-year-old will never forget.
Finally, in the UK, Phil Garner found a bedraggled duck named Freda at a local fishing pond. After taking the bird home, Phil and his wife Julia nursed her back to full strength. Freda stayed with them for 18 months, then mysteriously disappeared. But eventually, the prodigal duck returned home with a new boyfriend and 11 ducklings in tow! Now Phil, Julia, Freda, and her brood are one big happy family.
Donald Trump was fined $5,000 Friday by the judge in his New York civil trial because a social media post disparaging one of his staffers remained visible for weeks.
New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron had ordered Trump on Oct. 3 not to criticize his staff and to delete the post that showed his clerk, Allison Greenfield, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and accused her of being his girlfriend.  But the post remained visible for weeks.
"Make no mistake: future violations, whether intentional or unintentional, will subject the violator to far more severe sanctions, which may include, but are not limited to, steeper financial penalties, holding Donald Trump in contempt of court, and possibly imprisoning him," Engoron said.
The dispute illustrated how judges could potentially penalize Trump even before verdicts in the various civil and criminal cases pending against him. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has also ordered Trump not to criticize prosecutors, court staff or witnesses in his federal trial on charges he conspired to overturn the 2020 election.
Trump asked Chutkan on Friday to suspend her order while he appeals her decision.
"No Court in American history has imposed a gag order on a criminal defendant who is campaigning for public office − least of all, on the leading candidate for President of the United States," Trump's lawyers said in the filing.
Engoron called Truth Social’s retention of the post a “blatant violation” of his limited gag order.
“Incendiary untruths can and have led to serious physical harm,” Engoron said. “I will now allow the defendant to explain why this should not end up with serious sanctions or I could possibly imprison him.”
Trump wasn’t in court Friday, but the post was removed late Thursday.
Before the post was removed, Trump’s campaign sent it out as an email to his supporters. Christopher Kise, one of Trump’s lawyers, said the email was sent to 25,800 recipients and opened by about 6,700. About 3,700 people viewed the post on Trump’s campaign website, Kise said.
“Based on my understanding this was truly inadvertent," Kise said. "The Truth Social post was taken down when the court asked and Trump never made any more comments about court staff, but it appears no one took it down on the campaign website. It is unfortunate and I apologize on behalf of my client."
America’s most visited national park, Great Smoky Mountains, saw more visitors last year than the next two parks combined, Grand Canyon and Zion.
Part of the reason is the location. Many people drive through the park on the way to another destination. But the park’s appeal can’t be underestimated. The Smokies are truly, well, great.
“I've been here almost 24 years, and I truly understand why it's not called the So So Smoky Mountains,” chuckled park ranger Brad Free. “Really, I think it should be called the Awesome Smoky Mountains.”
Here’s why and what travelers should know about Great Smoky Mountains, the latest national park in USA TODAY’s yearlong series.
“It's just so diverse in so many different ways,” Free said, citing the array of plants, animals, geology and human history within the park. “It’s just a beautiful place.”
Along with that beauty is a sense of belonging many visitors and rangers experience at the park.
“It's like going home to your grandparents,” he said. “This is a great place to come and just say ‘Ah, I want to hug my mountains.’ “
‘These are my people’:How Dolly Parton stays true to her Smokies roots at Dollywood
The park stretches across more than 522,000 acres of East Tennessee and Western North Carolina.
Its two visitor centers are located near Cherokee, North Carolina, and Gatlinburg, Tennessee. 
The closest airport to the park’s Gatlinburg entrance is McGhee-Tyson Airport, which is about 45 miles away, near Knoxville. The closest airport to the Cherokee entrance is Asheville Regional Airport, which is about 60 miles away.
The name stems from the Cherokee term for the area, which translates to “place of the blue smoke,” according to Free and the Tennessee State Museum. 
Sevier County Tennessee’s tourism website, Visit My Smokies, explains that signature smoke is “actually fog that comes from the area’s vegetation.”
“The Cherokee have been here for thousands of years,” Free said. 
The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians still share their rich culture with visitors in Cherokee, North Carolina, a destination unto itself just outside the park. 
Free noted there doesn’t appear to have been any permanent Cherokee villages within the park proper, but they hunted and gathered there, as evidenced by 9,000-year-old arrowheads found in the park. 
“The early European explorers and settlers that came through here learned so much about how to survive in these mountains from the Cherokee that were here,” he said. 
There are no fees to enter the park. However, parking fees are required for any vehicle parking in the park for longer than 15 minutes. 
Parking passes cost $5 for one day, $15 for seven days and $40 for annual parking.
Yes. “A lot of people find us by accident. They don’t even know a national park is here. They’re just driving through,” Free said.
Other visitors come just for a scenic drive, but Free said to really know the park, visitors need to get out and hit the trails.
It's not just the Smokies:Visiting the not-so-hidden gems of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge
“It really depends on what you’re looking for,” Free said. 
The busy Gatlinburg entrance is popular among visitors coupling park time with vacationing in Gatlinburg or nearby Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, home of Dollywood. 
The Cherokee entrance is less crowded and very scenic, with numerous streams. “It actually takes you over the mountain and back over to this side over here, which is I think a very pretty drive,” Free said.
A third option is a park entrance near Townsend, Tennessee. 
“It really only takes you into our Cades Cove area of the park, which is probably one of the busiest places in the park,” Free said. 
The busiest months in the park are May through October, but Free said, “Each season has something, really a gift for everybody.” 
He cited wildflowers in the spring, greenery in the summer and the rainbow of colors in the fall. He loves the wintertime in the park, when crowds fade and the mountains really come into view.
“It’s kind of like if I shave my beard, you see my face. That’s kind of what happens when the leaves fall off,” he said. “You can see the faces of the mountains, you see the heartbeat of the mountains through the wintertime. And walking through the woods with a little fresh fallen snow and nothing else around, there is nothing else like that.”
From Cades Cove to Clingmans Dome, the highest point in the park, there is so much to see at Great Smoky Mountain National Park. No one corner covers it all, but Free said Alum Cave trail comes close. 
“It's a five-mile round trip, but that trail there has pretty much everything the park offers on the trail, except for a waterfall,” he said. “It's got streams, got geology, got elevation, got views, got old growth forest … If you do one trail, do that trail.”
Free recommends at least two days in the park, with one day spent in the higher elevations and another day in the lower elevations.
“But all that's going to do is just get your taste buds ready for something else,” he smiled, adding that five days would provide a better foundation. “I’ve been here a long time, and I still haven't done everything.”
On a cloudy fall day in Washington, D.C., Brandon Washington lit up the field with an electric 63-yard touchdown run. On his third offensive play of the game, the quarterback took the snap, scampered through the line of scrimmage and sprinted his way straight down the middle of the field all the way to the end zone.
Not only was it the Gallaudet Bison’s first score of the day, but it was the first touchdown for the 5G-connected helmet, a technology the world’s only liberal arts university for deaf and hard-of-hearing students developed with AT&T. Wearing the helmet, a player doesn’t have to hear a play call, but can see it.
"It was great, cushioned on the inside. It really fits my head," Washington told USA TODAY Sports of the helmet, which went through several iterations before game day. "The lens is not too big or too small, so I can see really, really good out of it. I really love the helmet.”
After Washington and the Bison beat the Hilbert Hawks 34-20 in the Oct. 7 home game at Hotchkiss Field, the junior was named the Eastern Collegiate Football Conference co-offensive player of the week for putting up 124 rushing yards and three touchdowns.
"Brandon is one of the most electrifying players that we've had come through here," Coach Chuck Goldstein said. "He’s pretty special and talented.”
AT&T's Chief Marketing and Growth Officer, Kellyn Smith Kenny, was at the game to officially unveil the 5G-connected Riddell helmet and present a gift of $500,000 to the team.
"The stands were going crazy," Smith Kenny said of Washington's first score. "I'm like turning around high-fiving everyone. It was so, so incredibly special.”
The 5G-connected helmet uses the same technology that powers cell phones across the United States.
AT&T placed a microprocessor inside a Riddell helmet. It is connected to a lens mounted on the top of the helmet's facemask.
A coach can select a play on a tablet and then send it to the player, who can then see the play displayed on the lens.
Goldstein explained how Gallaudet, who invented the huddle in 1894 because the team needed to protect their communication using American Sign Language, embraced the helmet. He said that getting used to sending a play to the helmet slows down his current process communicating with Washington and freshman quarterback Trevin Adams, but he understands the overall helpfulness of the technology.

"Every other game that we prepare for, we do what we normally do and I think people don't realize is, when we communicate in our language, ASL, we're pretty fast. We're efficient. We're fast," he said. "What this does, this helps level the playing field with limiting mistakes, getting somebody's attention. When Trevin's in the game, and he's further away, he's not looking at me, I cannot get (his attention). We’re living with whatever play that’s called, that's it. This gives us an opportunity for me to get his attention. There’s a red exclamation point on the tablet, I hit it, it pops up. He knows automatically to stop what he's doing and look at me."
Athletic director Warren Keller pondered how the helmet could have a positive impact for hearing players as well.
"Just imagine how often in each NFL game, with 80,000 fans screaming in attendance, how many times there's a delay of game, offsides?" he said in ASL through an interpreter. "How many timeouts are burned, how many penalties occur because people are so reliant on being able to hear? But having this visual access and being able to communicate in that way, this technology with Gallaudet's help guiding, this will be able to change the future."
Derek Carr, quarterback of the NFL's New Orleans Saints, recently made headlines when Taysom Hill noticed the ear hole coverings on his helmet. Carr explained to his teammate that they help block out crowd noise.
Smith Kenny said the possibilities for the helmet go beyond football.
"We've had people reach out to us saying, 'Hey, if you think about the capabilities of the helmet, could a 5G-connected helmet improve safety on construction sites or for first responders, or even potentially lead to more job opportunities for the deaf community?'" she shared. "It's incredibly exciting and inspiring."
Brandon Washington and Trevin Adams are the Gallaudet quarterbacks for whom the 5G helmets were designed. The helmet is giving them opportunities to shine on a national stage.
They are featured in AT&T's commercial that debuted last week during "College GameDay" showing what the 5G-connected helmet can do. Washington was cheering next to Goldstein as Adams scored a touchdown using the helmet. The background track, "Sound of Silence" is sung by partially-deaf artist Amira Unplugged and all of the promotional videos have open captioning.
Washington, a junior who hails from Citronelle, Ala., wore the helmet in its debut and scored three touchdowns as the Bison beat Hilbert. He offered feedback to the AT&T team as the helmet went through several iterations, including that an early version was too heavy due to a bulky battery pack.
This is his second year playing quarterback after Goldstein moved him from wide receiver because of depth needs.
"At first, I was telling him, 'Nah, nah, I don’t wanna play quarterback,'" Washington told USA TODAY Sports. "But then, you know, I got over it and I was like, 'Yeah, I do wanna play quarterback because I want to touch the ball.' I want the ball in my hands. I like to score."
He was last year's ECFC Offensive Player of the Year when the team won the conference championship. He had 1,363 yards of total offense on the season, including eight rushing touchdowns.
Last year, Adams captured the eight-man football championship with the California School for the Deaf-Riverside to cap off an undefeated season with an 80-26 victory. He wanted to attend Gallaudet because both of his parents went there, and his father played football for the Bison. The family attended a celebration for the school's 150th anniversary, which was observed through the 2013-14 school year, and Adams wanted to carry on the tradition.
"I knew this was going to be the university I was gonna go to," Adams said in ASL through an interpreter. "And it's just top notch, 100% deaf access, all the teachers can sign, everybody. It is all ASL access everywhere and I just thought I knew that this was going to be my university. And now here I am a student and I've loved it. Gallaudet just is awesome."
"Trevin coming in, and as a freshman, has really been a blessing," Goldstein said. "He is the future of this program, of this team, of this community. He’s great. The future is really looking good. We're OK, we're gonna be in good hands for the next four more, three more years after this."
Gallaudet prides itself on being at the forefront of innovation to create equality for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
The school’s president, Roberta “Bobbi” Cordano, is the first deaf woman and first openly LGBTQ person to hold the position. She was named one of USA TODAY's Women of the Year for her leadership.
"I think it's the daily work of being president of Gallaudet to advance equality. That's my job. That's what I do," she said. "And to make sure that our students have the opportunity and the preparation and the tools they need to go out into the world and thrive. That's advancing equality."
While the 5G-connected helmet is a major breakthrough, there is still a ways to go in leveling the playing field for deaf and hard-of-hearing athletes.
"I wanna make sure people understand: Our players, no matter what, any game we show up, it doesn’t matter who the opponent is or who we have on our roster, we’re never gonna have a level playing field. We just won’t," Goldstein said. "There is a communication barrier."
One of those barriers is with officials who don't sign.
"An official can tell a hearing player on the other team to scoot back or, 'Hey watch your hands on this' or 'Don’t do that,'" Goldstein said. "If he does communicate that with our players, our player’s probably reading his lips, and that’s not fair."
Gallaudet's players also can't hear a whistle being blown, which can be a safety issue.
"If somebody, the whistle’s blown and somebody makes an athletic move on the other team, we’re going to tackle him, always," the coach continued. "I tell our players, 'That’s the one thing I’m not gonna get mad at you about, if you tackle somebody late. Because we’d rather get a 15-yard penalty compared to six points that we give up.'"
And while the helmet helps with player-coach communication, it was only authorized by the NCAA for use in one game and was only worn by the quarterback.
"So this technology is gonna help bridge the gap to a level playing field, it’s gonna help us get closer," he said, "but until I can put every player in one of these helmets — and who knows 20 years from now if this is something that will be used at every level of football — it’s just gonna help bridge the gap and it’s gonna make a difference for us."
Who could benefit the most from Biden’s latest attempt at student loan forgiveness?
Undergraduates at public two-year colleges might be in the best position – if the administration’s new policy holding predatory colleges more accountable goes as planned, that is. 
And borrowers who earn certificates, rather than four-year degrees, using the new income-driven repayment plan will have to pay back only about a third, on average, of what they borrowed. 
Those findings were laid out in a research analysis published this week by the Urban Institute, a social and economic policy think tank. The report uses data from the College Scorecard, an online Education Department tool that lets consumers compare colleges, to determine what loan repayment might look like under the policy revision dubbed by the administration "Saving on A Valuable Education," or SAVE. The system bases monthly loan repayments on borrowers' incomes and family sizes, according to the Education Department, lowering payments for almost everyone who participates.
Income-driven repayment is not a new concept, but Education Secretary Miguel Cardona has referred to the newest iteration of the program as the “most affordable repayment plan ever.” For some borrowers, it will reduce monthly payments to $0. More than 4 million borrowers have already enrolled, and it will be fully available to all federal student-loan borrowers starting July 1, 2024. 
Saving the SAVE student loan plan:Education Department works to rally support for Biden's SAVE student loan repayment plan
Undergraduates are in luck, the report says. Nearly all the largest undergraduate fields in the country will see a decrease in the number of programs in which borrowers typically repay their loans in full. 
Yet the plan, according to researchers, is less likely to increase the already large benefits for typical graduate borrowers, who have historically benefited disproportionately compared with undergrads from income-driven repayment plans. Graduate students on average take out more loans than undergraduates, and a 2020 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office showed they received the most help from income-based programs.  
Undergraduate psychology programs could also see an easier path to repayment, according to the report. Under current income-driven repayment policies, nearly 100% of programs require such borrowers to fully repay, the report says. That number will drop to a little more than a quarter of programs under SAVE. The program seems to be good news for borrowers pursuing humanities and teaching degrees, too.
Millions plan to use Biden's SAVE planto cut student loan payments even as some in GOP try to stop it
A smaller difference, the researchers suggest, is expected for borrowers pursuing degrees in engineering, finance or registered nursing. In those fields, most undergraduate programs based on income already require the typical borrower to fully repay their loans. That doesn’t seem likely to change, at least not significantly, because those borrowers generally go on to higher-paying jobs.
When it comes to the SAVE rollout, one big question mark will be the implications of the Biden administration’s efforts to crack down on predatory colleges, according to Jason Cohn, a research analyst at the Urban Institute and one of the authors of the report.
The analysis, for instance, predicts the highest loan forgiveness rate under SAVE will be at public two-year institutions. But it's a conclusion that can only be made after excluding programs likely to fail new accountability metrics rolled out last month by the Education Department.
Without the new so-called "gainful employment" rule, Cohn told USA TODAY, the highest forgiveness rate could actually be at for-profit institutions. 
“A lot of it really comes down to how institutions and students see this issue, how this information gets spread, and also how accountability efforts play out,” he said.

FORT DODGE, Iowa — Allison Roderick has a warning and a pledge for rural residents of her county: The water from their wells could be contaminated, but the government can help make it safe.
Roderick is the environmental health officer for Webster County in north-central Iowa, where a few thousand rural residents live among sprawling corn and soybean fields. Many draw their water from private wells, which are exempt from most federal testing and purity regulations. Roderick spreads the word that they aren’t exempt from danger.
The college football season has reached the back nine with seven weeks down and seven more to go before the playoff pairings and bowl lineup is announced. Between now and then, there's sure to be surprises along the way.
The hard part is sorting out when and where they're going to come from. This Saturday, however, provides plenty of opportunity for upsets and unlikely results with a Big Ten showdown between Penn State and Ohio State leading the schedule and key conference matchups in the SEC, Pac-12 and ACC.
That's why we're here to make sense of things. The USA TODAY Sports college football staff — Scooby Axson, Jace Evans, Paul Myerberg, Erick Smith, Eddie Timanus and Dan Wolken — weigh in with bold predictions for Week 8 of the college football season.
If there is a Group of Five team you should be paying attention to, it’s Air Force, and even though quarterback Zac Larrier is out because of a knee injury, the Falcons should have no issues handling Navy this weekend.
And if the Falcons keep winning, the College Football Playoff committee will be forced to pay attention, and with good reason. The undefeated Falcons lead the nation in fewest penalties, third-down conversions, and rushing offense, while keeping the ball for nearly 35 minutes a game. The defense is also doing its part, ranking in the top 10 in rushing defense, passing defense, scoring defense, and total defense, with that unit being on the field for the fewest plays of any team in the nation. — Scooby Axson

WEEKEND FORECAST: Picks for Ohio State-Penn State and each Top 25 game
Utah has defeated Southern California three consecutive times, including twice last season to single-handedly keep the Trojans out of the College Football Playoff. But No. 16 USC will get some revenge, and a needed bounce-back win after last week’s debacle in South Bend, against the No. 14 Utes. Yes, Utah’s defense has been great and USC’s has still been mostly bad; but you need to score some points to beat the Trojans and the Utes just can’t do it. Utah is sitting 115th in yards per game and is tied for 109th in scoring. USC trails only Oregon in points per game and is No. 9 in total offense – and it seems unlikely Caleb Williams is going to throw three picks two weeks in a row. It might be a long day for the Utes at the L.A. Coliseum. — Jace Evans
Alabama’s offense comes alive and sparks a blowout win against Tennessee. We’ve seen this happen in chunks against opponents such as Arkansas only for Jalen Milroe and the Crimson Tide to struggle putting teams away in the second half. A more complete performance in double-digit win against the Volunteers would show how far the Tide have come since losing to Texas and struggling against South Florida. — Paul Myerberg
This weekend will go one of two ways for Texas. The buildup of disappointment from the past two weeks after the loss to Oklahoma will be released in cathartic fashion against Houston. The alternative is that stewing for that long will allow the Longhorns to take their eye off the ball when traveling to face the Cougars, whose season will be made by beating their former Southwest Conference rival in their only season as Big 12 opponents. Past versions of the Longhorns would slip up in this spot. We'll not go that far, but expect a raucous home crowd help keep Houston in the game and the finish to be way closer than expected. — Erick Smith
Utah will emerge victorious against Southern California in the Coliseum. At first blush this might not seem like a bold pronouncement, since the Utes beat the Trojans not once but twice last season. Nevertheless, with the Utes still likely to be without quarterback Cam Rising, the Trojans are touchdown favorites at home according to most outlets.
But we’re not buying. Sure, USC still has Caleb Williams. But the reigning Heisman winner doesn’t have the elite receiving talent he had a year ago, nor does he have the same pass protection. Notre Dame forced five turnovers last week, and the Utes’ defensive front is even nastier. Utah should also be able to move the ball on the ground, with or without Rising. They might not win it going away, but the Utes will prevail. — Eddie Timanus
The Ohio State game has been the biggest negative on James Franklin's resume at Penn State. Outside of that 2016 win in State College, the Nittany Lions have found a lot of frustration in this matchup with a couple of one-point losses and maybe one or two other opportunities to win that they've let slip by. But is that really a Penn State thing, or is it just illustrative of how hard it is for anyone to beat Ohio State in this era?
I think it's the latter. But the Buckeyes appear to be just a tiny bit more beatable this year — not by much, but by enough to put them in jeopardy of losing to perhaps Franklin's best team at Penn State. 
While the Nittany Lions aren't necessarily as dynamic offensively as you'd like, we saw how much trouble Notre Dame's defense gave Ohio State earlier in the season. And Penn State's defense is probably a cut above that. So even in Columbus, this lines up as the year for Franklin to get Penn State's first win in the Horseshoe since 2011. — Dan Wolken
A former Connecticut postmaster could face 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to defrauding the U.S. Postal Service of $875,000 through bribery and embezzlement schemes.
Ephrem D. Nguyen, a postmaster for a postal office in Danbury, Connecticut pleaded guilty on Oct. 13 to multiple schemes involving using USPS credit cards to pay a vendor about at least $760,000 more than necessary for maintenance and repair work, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Additionally, he said he embezzled over $80,000 with credit cards to rent vehicles for personal use and approved fraudulent travel expense reimbursement claims exceeding $8,000 for a co-worker.
The former employee's work responsibilities included supervising maintenance and repair for USPS equipment, facilities and vehicles.

In late 2020, Nguyen required that all maintenance and repair for the postal services go through a specific vendor despite knowing another vendor had been contracted for the office, the news release states. He also demanded the vendor provide free vehicle maintenance and repairs for himself, a co-worker, one of his children and an employee of Nguyen's personal business.
In 2022, the former employee asked for and received $90,000 from the same vendor through cash bribes causing USPS to overpay the vendor for vehicle service that he called a "raise," according to the news release.
The accumulation of these defrauding schemes adds to about $874,930.59, the release states.
"As federal employees, we take an oath to protect the public, including funds that have been allocated for federal services,” U.S. Attorney Avery said in the release. "This corrupt employee operated a brazen bribery, kickback, and embezzlement scheme that defrauded the U.S. Postal Service of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  I commend the USPS Office of Inspector General and the FBI for their excellent work in this investigation."
The federal public defender representing Nguyen has declined requests for comment, according to the Associated Press.
"The public must have confidence that Postal Service employees will conduct their work in an honest manner," Kenneth Cleevely, a Special Agent for USPS' Inspector General, said in the news release.
Nguyen was released on a $100,00 bond and currently resides in Quincy, Massachusetts where he awaits his sentencing.
The hearing is scheduled for Jan. 5 and the honest service wire fraud he admitted to carries a maximum imprisonment term of 20 years, according to the news release.

PHOENIX − It was completely dead silence inside the Philadelphia Phillies’ clubhouse late Friday evening.
Players stared vacantly into their lockers in utter disbelief. The Phillies front office talked in hushed tones inside manager Rob Thomson’s office. Owner John Middleton stood silently down the hallway.
When the Phillies spoke after their stunning 6-5 meltdown to the Arizona Diamondbacks, it was in short, subdued snippets for cameras and reporters, trying to convince everyone they’ll be fine.
The look on their faces, however, lacked all confidence.
This is a team that arrived into Phoenix three days ago, talking about jumping into the pool at Chase Field once they swept away the Diamondbacks, debating who they’d rather play in the World Series.
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
They instead spent the night watching a safe eighth-inning lead melt in the desert, and are now in a fight for their lives.
The National League Championship Series may be tied at 2-apiece, but the Diamondbacks are now in the driver’s seat, with their ace, Zac Gallen, lined up for Game 5 [8:07 p.m. ET, TBS] at Chase Field before they return to Philadelphia.
"I’m tired of that narrative that we're lucky to be here …,’’ D-backs manager Torey Lovullo said. “I think they take things personal. They have a chip on their shoulder. I know their backup catcher [Garrett Stubbs] made a statement about sprinting towards the pool or making a beeline to the pool.
“So, I think they're wearing that a little bit, and they're motivated by that externally, and they're motivated to be as good as they possibly can internally.’’
NLCS GAME 4 RECAP:Kimbrel melts down as Diamondbacks rally to beat Phillies, even up NLCS
While the Diamondbacks celebrated their most dramatic playoff victory since winning the 2001 World Series, president Dave Dombrowski and GM Sam Fuld sat with Thompson in his office, trying to make sense of it all.
Sure, they have their ace, Zack Wheeler going in Game 5 against Gallen, but their bullpen is in utter disarray, having no idea who they can trust.
The man who has saved 417 career games, Craig Kimbrel, has melted down at the absolute worst time.
He lost Game 3 in the ninth inning, and for an encore, blew a 5-3 lead in the eighth inning.
He faced six batters Friday.
Four batters reached base.
And he nearly caused the roof to blow off Chase Field when he gave up a stunning game-tying, two-run home run to rookie Alek Thomas on a 3-and-2 fastball that splashed down in the pool. He dropped to his knees in agony as Thomas danced around the bases, basking in the deafening ovation.
“I mean, that play is definitely something that you see in your dreams,’’ Thomas said. “For it to come in real life and for it to happen to me is just awesome. I'm so grateful to have that moment. It's just unreal. Just crazy.
“I haven't really processed it yet, but it was awesome.’’
Four batters later, it was all over. Kimbrel left two batters on base when he was mercifully pulled, and Jose Alvarado couldn’t clean up his mess with Gabriel Moreno lining a single to center field for a 6-5 lead.
D-backs closer Paul Sewald came in for the ninth, gave up a two-run double to Kyle Schwarber, but struck out Trea Turner to complete the crazy night.
“I can't really describe how I feel,’’ Lovullo said, “because I haven't had a chance to interpret what just happened. It happened so quickly, and it was just a group of players banding together and getting the job done.’’
Well, Kimbrel shared the problem describing his emotions, too.
This is a guy who just three days ago was discussing the Hall of Fame in an interview room.
This night, he was proving why he’ll fall short of a Cooperstown induction.
It’s one thing to have the seventh-most saves in baseball history, but when the Boston Red Sox snub you during their 2018 World Series run by using starter Chris Sale for their final outs, and the Los Angeles Dodgers leave you completely off the roster in last year’s postseason, and you melt down for the Phillies a year later, you have a tarnished Hall of Fame resume.
Who knows if the Phillies will now trust him again the rest of the postseason?
Certainly, not in a critical moment.
Kimbrel, with his iPad open in his locker,  was the first one to speak in the Phillies clubhouse.
He responded quickly, succinctly, but had no real answers for the meltdown.
Question: “Craig, what happened to the 3-2 pitch to Thomas?
Kimbrel: “He hit it over the fence.’’
Question: Location?
Kimbrel: “I wouldn’t say location. It was terrible. He just put a good swing on it, and hit it out of the ballpark.’’
Question: How’s your confidence?
Kimbrel: “I mean, the last two games sucked. I roll up in here and cost us two games. … I can’t let that get in the way of what my job is and what I need to do. I need to show up and be ready.’’
Question: How do you keep your mind right?
“I mean, I’ve been doing this for a long time. I’ve lost a lot of ball games and I won a lot of ball games. And the only way you come back to be successful is believing you can. And I believe the next time I touch the ball it’s going to be great.
And, so it went for 1 minute, 42 seconds.
Kimbrel spoke about his inability to throw his curveball for strikes, falling behind in the count, insists he still has confidence, but has no idea whether he’ll be able to pitch for a third consecutive day if needed in Game 5.
Really, the Phillies have no idea who’ll be available until they check in with their relievers before Saturday’s game, praying that Wheeler, can go at least six innings, preferably seven, if not longer.
Still, they know they are in trouble.
They have an exhausted bullpen, using 11 relievers in the last two games to combine for 26 outs. They can no longer trust Kimbrel or rookie Orion Kenkering, and still have two pitchers they haven’t dared to use in games in Taijuan Walker and Michael Lorenzen.
Can they dare use Kimbrel in another save situation the rest of the postseason?
“We have to talk about it, but do you put him in at a little lower leverage spot?’’ Thomson said. “I don't know.’’
So, while the Diamondbacks are winning a game using eight different relievers like Friday, the Phillies are using an 11-man staff instead of 13, and suddenly are without a reliable closer.
Thomson has turned to Kerkering in crucial situations the last two games. And twice has imploded. He gave up three consecutive hits without retiring a batter in Game 3, and walked two batters and got one out in Game 4. He suddenly has lost command, falling behind in counts, and the price.
“That’s how you turn good hitters into great hitters,’’ Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto said. “We’re just falling behind too much and not attacking.’’
Perhaps the most alarming facet of the Phillies’ predicament is that they’ve managed to shut down the D-backs’ power-hitting trio of Corbin Carroll, Christian Walker and Tommy Pham, and it has made little difference. They are hitting just .071 in the series without an extra-base hit, but they haven’t figured out a way to stop leadoff hitter Ketel Marte, who’s hitting .471 (8-for-17) and reached base three more times Friday.
Much of the Phillies’ pain is also self-inflicted, with the Diamondbacks scoring one run on an error, passed ball and pitcher Cristopher Sanchez forgetting how many outs there were in an inning, another on a wild pitch, and their bullpen issuing four walks and a hit-by-pitch leading to four runs in the seventh and eighth innings.
“It’s just a sloppy game all around,’’ Realmuto said. “It’s not acceptable to play that way when the game is big.’’
The Phillies tried to shrug it off, with Alvarado saying, “Hey, it’s baseball,’’ but the Phillies’ confidence is clearly shaken. The swagger is gone. They may have games 6 and 7 scheduled in Philadelphia, but they can’t solely rely on their fans saving them from disaster.
It’s enough for the D-backs to believe they can not only play with the powerful Phillies, but slay the dragon, shocking the baseball world.
“We’re not going to give up,’’ said Thomas, 23, the youngest player in postseason history to hit a game-tying pinch-hit homer in the eighth inning or later. “‘How could we? We’re not done yet.
“We’re going to keep on doing our thing and hopefully good things happen.’’
