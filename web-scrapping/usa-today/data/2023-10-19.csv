WASHINGTON — The nation in its 16th day without a speaker of the House, and Republican lawmakers have made seemingly no progress towards electing a new, permanent leader. 
Instead, on Thursday Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, appeared to support a plan empowering Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., as speaker up until January to get the House moving again. McHenry has already been serving as an interim speaker with limited powers.
On Wednesday, Jordan, lost a second speaker election. Compared to the first ballot, Jordan lost additional support from House Republicans during the second vote, endangering his bid for the speakership. 
The push to grant McHenry additional powers came after Republican holdouts vowed not to support Jordan. Steve Womack, R-Ark., one of the holdouts, told reporters Wednesday evening he did not see a path forward for Jordan to become speaker.

Meanwhile, just a one-minute walk away from a closed-door meeting where House Republicans are debating a resolution to empower McHenry, House Democrats are huddling to discuss next steps.

Jordan will back empowering McHenry as temporary speaker up until January, according to a source familiar.
In the meantime, Jordan will continue to run for speaker and work to shore up support over the next few months.

Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., chair of the House Freedom Caucus, a loose coalition of hard-right lawmakers, told reporters he would oppose empowering McHenry with temporary powers.
The resolution to make McHenry effectively an interim speaker "sets a bad precedent," Perry said.

Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat representing Washington state, currently serves as president pro tempore of the Senate.
Without an official speaker of the House, Murray was next in line for the presidency after Vice President Kamala Harris in the case of an emergency.

House Republicans will huddle in a closed-door conference meeting at 11 a.m. Thursday to discuss next steps.
The meeting comes as Jordan faces growing opposition to his bid for speaker and talks increase about giving temporary speaker Patrick McHenry more power.

As Jim Jordan still faces stiff opposition from GOP holdouts after failing two consecutive ballots, it is unclear when the House will hold a third speaker election.The House will come into session at noon for a roll call vote to determine attendance, but it's uncertain when a speaker vote will be held.
Jordan, R-Ohio, told reporters Wednesday he intends to stay in the race and expected a vote at noon Thursday. But as it remains clear Jordan has no path towards the 217 votes he needs to become speaker, the timing of the third speaker election is up in the air.

Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., one of the moderate GOP lawmakers opposing Jordan, told USA TODAY the House is in its state of paralysis by the fault of the conservative hardliners who have overturned "precedent."
Hard-right lawmakers, Lawler told USA TODAY, "set a new precedent within this congress." The New York Republican referenced multiple times ultraconservatives tanked rule votes, traditionally procedural votes that until this year, never failed.
The historic move to remove McCarthy from the speakership, Lawler added, was done with "no real planning," resulting in the gridlock that has consumed House Republicans.
− Ken Tran
Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., was chosen to be acting House speaker from a succession list that McCarthy provided to a House clerk in January in case his seat became vacant.
McHenry is serving his 10th term in Congress and represents the 10th congressional district in North Carolina. He is a McCarthy ally and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, a role that helped him negotiate the debt limit deal earlier this year.
He was appointed in 2015 by then House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., to serve as the Chief Deputy Whip, helping Scalise build agreement around a conservative policy agenda for the House Republican Conference.

Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., one of the GOP holdouts against Jordan voted for former speaker John Boehner on Wednesday in the second speaker election as a protest vote.
The vote drew some applause from House Democrats.
Boehner served as House speaker from 2011 to 2015 and was virtually removed by House Republicans, led by Jordan and the House Freedom Caucus, who threatened to oust him from the speakership akin to McCarthy’s ejection earlier this month. Boehner ultimately resigned in the face of those threats.

No. 
Technically, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries could be elected, as there are no requirements for the speaker to be from the majority party (or even a member of Congress). In both rounds of voting this week, Jeffries has received 212 votes, the full backing of House Democrats and more than Rep. Jim Jordan both times.
However, the New York Democrat would still need five more votes to hit the necessary 217.
Despite infighting among Republicans, it's very doubtful any lawmaker on the right, let alone five, will cast a vote across the aisle.
−Savannah Kuchar
The number of votes needed is determined by a majority of House lawmakers present and voting.
On Tuesday, that number was 217. Because no lawmaker received 217 votes in the first election, the speaker race continues today.
When the vote for speaker begins Wednesday, members will have a roll call vote to determine how many are present and voting − and how many votes are needed to win. Then they will be called on individually to cast their vote for a speaker.
Voting could last several rounds Wednesday or be postponed until another day if a speaker isn't elected during the second try.

Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., is prepared to "step up" and serve as House speaker to help lead the party out of the chaos both it and the nation currently face, his spokesman James Hogge said in an email to the Detriot Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.
"It’s becoming clear Rep. Jordan’s path is narrowing by the hour,” Hogge said. ““We cannot go another day without a Speaker. He simply doesn’t have the votes — we need to have a frank discussion as a conference about a path forward. If as a conference we see he can’t get the necessary votes to become Speaker, General Bergman is prepared to step up."
20 House Republicans voted against Jordan in the first House speaker election while 22 Republicans voted against him in the second election. Bergman supported Jordan in both rounds.
Bergman said on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday that “We need a leader to step up to unite the Republican conference, actually pass critical legislation, and move our Nation forward.”

The second ballot was another setback for Jordan’s bid for speaker. Twenty-two GOP lawmakers voted against Jordan, an increase from the 20 that opposed him on Tuesday. They are:

When Angel Amankwaah traveled from Denver to North Carolina Central University for incoming student orientation this summer, she decided she had made the right choice. 
She had fun learning the chants that fans perform at football games. But she also saw that “there are students who look like me, and professors who look like me” at the historically Black university, said Amankwaah, 18, who is Black. “I knew that I was in a safe space.”
This has in the past two years become an important consideration for college-bound students from all backgrounds and beliefs. With so much attention focused on these issues, USA TODAY and The Hechinger Report present the first-of-its-kind College Welcome Guide showing state laws and institutional policies that affect college and university students, from bans on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and “critical race theory” to rules about guns on campus and whether student IDs are accepted as proof of residency for voting purposes.
The digital tables also list, for every four-year institution in the country, such things as racial and gender diversity among students and faculty, the number of student veterans enrolled, the incidence of on-campus race-motivated hate crimes, free-speech rankings and if the university or college serves many students from rural places.
Test our new College Welcome Guide:These tools offer a new lens on campus life.
Students have long picked schools based on their academic reputations and social life. But with campuses in the crosshairs of the culture wars, many students are now also taking stock of attacks on diversity, course content and speech and speakers from both ends of the political spectrum. They’re monitoring hate crimes, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, state abortion laws and whether students like them ‒ Black, rural, military veterans, LGBTQ+ or from other backgrounds ‒ are represented and supported on campus.
“There’s no question that what’s happening at the state level is directly affecting these students,” said Alyse Levine, founder and CEO of Premium Prep, a private college admissions consulting firm in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. When they look at colleges in various states now, she said, “There are students who are asking, ‘Am I really wanted here?’”
For some students on both sides of the political divide, the answer is no. In the chaotic new world of American colleges and universities, many say they feel unwelcome at certain schools, while others are prepared to shut down speakers and report faculty with whose opinions they disagree.
It’s too early to know how much this trend will affect where and whether prospective students end up going to college since publicly available enrollment data lags real time. But there are early clues that it’s having a significant impact.
One in 4 prospective students has already ruled out a college or university for consideration because of the political climate in its state, according to a survey by the higher education consulting firm Art & Science Group.
Among students who describe themselves as liberal, the most common reason to rule out colleges and universities in a particular state, that survey found, is because it’s “too Republican” or has what they consider lax gun regulations, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, restrictive abortion laws and a lack of concern about racism. Students who describe themselves as conservative are rejecting states they believe to be “too Democrat” and that have liberal abortion and gay rights laws.
Sixty percent of prospective students of all backgrounds say new state restrictions on abortion would at least somewhat influence where they choose to go to college, a separate poll by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation found. Of these, 8 in 10 say they would prefer to go to a state with greater access to reproductive health services. (Lumina is among the funders of The Hechinger Report, which produced this story.)
“We have many young women who will not look at certain states,” said Levine. One of her own clients backed out of going to a university in St. Louis after Missouri banned almost all abortions following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, she said.
Institutions in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Texas are the most likely to be knocked off the lists of liberal students, according to the Art & Science Group survey. They’re generally most likely to steer clear of the South and Midwest, while conservative students avoid California and New York.
One in 8 high school students in Florida say they won’t go to a public university in their own state because of its education policies, a separate poll, by the college ranking and information website Intelligent.com, found.
With 494 anti-LGBTQ+ laws proposed or adopted this year, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, prospective students who are LGBTQ+ and have experienced significant harassment because of it are nearly twice as likely to say they don't plan to go to college at all compared with students who experienced lower levels of harassment, according to a survey by GLSEN, formerly the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.
“You are attacking kids who are already vulnerable,” said Javier Gomez, an LGBTQ+ student in his first year at Miami Dade College. “And it’s not just queer students. So many young people are fed up.”
It’s not yet evident whether the new laws are affecting where LGBTQ+ young people are choosing to go to college, said Casey Pick, director of law and policy at The Trevor Project, which supports LGBTQ+ young people in crisis. But LGBTQ+ adults are moving away from states passing anti-LGBTQ+ laws, she said. And “if adult employees are taking this into account when they decide where they want to live, you can bet that college students are making the same decisions.”
Since DeSantis takeover,surge in dropouts at New College of Florida
Meanwhile, in an era of pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion policies in many states, and against affirmative action in college admissions nationwide, Amankwaah is one of a growing number of Black students choosing what they see as the relative security of an HBCU. Enrollment at HBCUs increased by around 3% in 2021, the last year for which the figure is available, while the number of students at other universities and colleges fell. 
“The real attack here is on the feeling of belonging,” said Jeremy Young, who directs the Freedom to Learn program at PEN America, which tracks laws that restrict college and university diversity efforts and teaching about race. “What it really does is hoist a flag to say to the most marginalized students, ‘We don’t want you here.’” 
More than 40% of university and college administrators say the Supreme Court ruling curbing the use of affirmative action in admissions will affect diversity on their campuses, a Princeton Review poll found as the school year was beginning.
College students of all races and political persuasions report feeling uncomfortable on campuses that have become political battlegrounds. Those on the left are bristling at new laws blocking programs in diversity, equity and inclusion and the teaching of certain perspectives about race; on the right, at conservative speakers being shouted down or canceled, unpopular comments being called out in class and what they see as an embrace of values different from what they learned at home.
More than 1 in 10 students at four-year universities now say they feel as if they downright don’t belong on their campus, and another 2 in 10 neither agree nor strongly agree that they belong, another Lumina and Gallup survey found. It found that those who answer in these ways are more likely to frequently experience stress and more likely to drop out.
Military veterans who use their GI Bill benefits to return to school say one of their most significant barriers is a feeling that they won’t be welcome, a survey by the D’Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University found. Nearly two-thirds say that faculty and administrators don’t understand the challenges they face, and 70% say the same thing about their non-veteran classmates. 
Colleges should be “safe and affirming spaces,” said Pick, of the Trevor Project ‒ not places of isolation and alienation.
Yet a significant number of students say they don’t feel comfortable sharing their views in class, according to another survey, conducted by College Pulse for the right-leaning Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at North Dakota State University. Of those, 72% say they worry their opinions would be considered unacceptable by classmates and 45%, by their professors. Conservative students are less likely than their liberal classmates to believe that all points of view are welcome and less willing to share theirs. 
“Is that really an intellectually diverse environment?” asked Sean Stevens, director of polling and analytics at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, which has launched a campus free-speech ranking based on students’ perceptions of comfort expressing ideas, tolerance for speakers and other measures. 
“Anecdotally and from personal experience, there’s certainly a pocket of students who are weighing these factors in terms of where to go to college,” Stevens said.
Eighty-one percent of liberal students and 53% of conservative ones say they support reporting faculty who make comments that they find offensive, the same survey found. It used sample comments such as, “There is no evidence of anti-Black bias in police shootings,” “Requiring vaccination for COVID is an assault on individual freedom” and “Biological sex is a scientific fact.”
A professor at Texas A&M University became the subject of an investigation when a student accused her of criticizing the state’s lieutenant governor during a lecture, though she was ultimately exonerated. An anthropology lecturer at the University of Chicago who taught an undergraduate course called “The Problem of Whiteness” said she was deluged with hateful messages when a conservative student posted her photo and email address on social media.
More than half of all freshmen say that colleges have the right to ban extreme speakers, according to an annual survey by an institute at the University of California, Los Angeles; the College Pulse poll says that sentiment is held by twice the proportion of liberal students as conservative ones.
A group of Stanford students in March disrupted an on-campus speech by a federal judge whose judicial record they said was anti-LGBTQ+. When he asked for an administrator to intervene, an associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion confronted him and asked: “Is it worth the pain that this causes and the division that this causes?” The associate dean was put on leave and later resigned. 
“Today it is a sad fact that the greatest threat to free speech comes from within the academy,” pronounced the right-leaning American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which is pushing colleges to sign on to its Campus Freedom Initiative that encourages teaching students about free expression during freshman orientation and disciplining people who disrupt speakers or events, among other measures.
“I have to imagine that universities that have a bad track record on freedom of expression or academic freedom, that it will affect their reputations,” said Steven Maguire, the organization’s campus freedom fellow. “I do hear people saying things like, ‘I’m worried about what kind of a college or university I can send my kids to and whether they’ll be free to be themselves and to express themselves.’”
Some colleges are now actively recruiting students on the basis of these kinds of concerns. Colorado College in September created a program to ease the process for students who want to transfer away from institutions in states that have banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; Hampshire College in Massachusetts has offered admission to any student from New College in Florida, subject of what critics have described as a conservative takeover. Thirty-five have so far accepted the invitation.
Though many conservative critics of colleges and universities say faculty are indoctrinating students with liberal opinions, incoming freshmen tend to hold left-leaning views before they ever set foot in a classroom, according to that UCLA survey.
Fewer than 1 in 5 consider themselves conservative. Three-quarters say abortion should be legal and favor stricter gun control laws, 68% say wealthy people should pay more taxes than they do now and 86% that climate change should be a federal priority and that there should be a clear path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
Prospective students say they are watching as new laws are passed and controversies erupt on campuses and actively looking into not just the quality of food and available majors at the colleges they might attend, but state politics.
“Once I decided I was going to North Carolina Central, I looked up whether North Carolina was a red state or a blue state,” Amankwaah said. (North Carolina has a Democrat as governor but Republicans control both chambers of the legislature and hold a veto-proof supermajority in the state Senate. 
Florida’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws prompted Javier Gomez to leave his native state and move to New York to go to fashion school. But then he came back, transferring to Miami Dade.
“People ask me, ‘Why the hell are you back in Florida?’” said Gomez. “The reason I came back was that there was this innate calling in me that you have to stick around and fight for the queer and trans kids here. It’s overwhelming at times. It can be very mentally depleting. But I wanted to stay and continue the fight and build community against hatred.”

Thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed and Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate from the northern Gaza Strip ahead of Israel's impending ground invasion, leading to a humanitarian crisis that has brought protests from the United Nations and around the world.
The U.N. said about 1 million Gaza residents have been displaced in just a week, about half of them finding refuge in U.N. schools and other facilities where water supplies are diminishing. The war has claimed more than 4,000 lives since Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack Oct. 7.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization pleaded with Israel on Sunday to immediately reverse evacuation orders for hospitals in northern Gaza, saying the deadlines are impossible to meet and risk additional loss of life. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that attacks on health care facilities are already causing deaths and injuries. 
"The health situation in north Gaza is dire," Tedros wrote on social media. "Evacuation orders by Israel to hospitals are practically impossible to implement and are a death sentence for the sick and injured."
Here are several organizations that are providing aid to people caught in the conflict.
How to cope:The videos out of Israel, Gaza are graphic, but some can't look away
The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) is a coalition of more than 170 nongovernmental organizations that includes tens of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis who share the goal of building peace between the two communities.
"Our members are speaking loudly and clearly about the values that unite our community: Opposition to this horrific violence, and a commitment to Israeli/Palestinian partnership on the path to ending it, and achieving peace and equality," the agency said in a statement.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is a humanitarian organization that aims to protect and aid victims of conflicts. The ICRC has been in Israel and the occupied territories since 1967. The organization is asking for donations to improve access to essential services like water and to support livelihood projects.
Doctors Without Borders is a nongovernmental organization that describes itself as an "independent, impartial and neutral" charity that provides humanitarian aid to people affected by conflict, disease outbreaks and natural and human-made disasters.
The agency is seeking donations to continue to provide medical care in the area. The agency has reported overcrowding in hospitals, a lack of medical supplies, and dangerous working conditions as it tries to support the thousands injured by the fighting.
UNRWA has designated shelters to host the estimated 127,000 people displaced in Gaza. The agency is seeking donations to support its work.
The Jewish Agency for Israel North American Council, an American charity organization, is accepting donations to help victims of terrorism.
Save the Children issued an emergency alert in response to the conflict, noting that escalating violence has left 1.2 million children in need of humanitarian aid. The agency is accepting donations.
National and international organizations that aid victims in the conflict include the Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF), which works to provide lifesaving medical relief and humanitarian aid.
Founded by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, in partnership with Emory University, The Carter Center is a humanitarian aid organization that has been promoting peace and a viable two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades.
After Israel declared war, The Carter Center released a statement condemning the targeting of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and called for international action to end the violence.

A second co-defendant with Donald Trump in the Georgia election conspiracy case, Sidney Powell, pleaded guilty Thursday to a half-dozen misdemeanors dealing with a conspiracy to interfere in the 2020 election.
Legal experts said Powell's central role in the conspiracy, as an election lawyer who baselessly claimed widespread election fraud in 2020, could have an impact on other defendants charged in the alleged racketeering conspiracy that sought to keep Trump in power.
“Miss Powell is at the vortex, the center, the hub of the alleged conspiracy,” said Gene Rossi, who handled Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations cases in his three decades as a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official. “She will be a phenomenal witness for the government because she was at strategic meetings, part of important conversations and she was a leader in implementing the scheme to discredit the lawful election of Joe Biden.”
Powell was initially charged with racketeering and six other counts as part of a wide-ranging scheme to overturn the election so Trump could remain in power. She was charged with tampering with election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia.
She pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit theft by taking and five counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with performance of election duties. Powell agreed to testify in future trials in exchange for serving six years of probation, a $6,000 fine and paying restitution of $2,700.
Powell is one of 19 co-defendants charged in the case, which alleged a broad racketeering conspiracy. Other portions of the conspiracy included the recruitment of fake presidential electors to vote for Trump despite President Joe Biden winning Georgia, lying about election results to state officials and in court records, and soliciting public officials to violate their oaths of office.
Legal experts said Powell's agreement to testify against others in the case is "very significant" because she dealt at length with Trump, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others charged in the conspiracy.
"I think it's very significant because she is one of the people who was closest to Trump in many of these alleged nefarious activities, and as part of the agreement, she must testify truthfully against Trump as well as the other defendants,' said John Banzhaf, a George Washington University law professor who has been following the case closely. "So it is a major victory for Fani Willis and certainly a major concern for Trump."
Powell worked closely with major figures in the chase. She participated in a news conference with Giuliani and co-defendant Jenna Ellis at the Republican National Committee portraying baseless allegations of election in November 2020. Powell met with Trump at the White House, including on Dec. 18, 2020, to discuss having the military seize voting machines, which Trump didn't order.
"Given the central role she played in public promotion of false claims of election fraud, it seems likely that she has significant information about the role of her co-defendants," said Alexander Reinert, a Benjamin Cardozo School of Law professor.
Kevin O’Brien, a former federal prosecutor now at Ford O’Brien Landy, called it a “very, very smart move” for Powell to pay a fine, avoid jail and keep her law license.
“Rudy Giuliani, as if he doesn't have enough to worry about, should be very worried,” O’Brien said. “Remember those press conferences the two  gave on all their ‘evidence’ of election interference?”
Rossie said Powell's guilty plea may persuade others to cooperate with prosecutors, turning "the slippery slope into a luge when it comes to cooperators."
Powell is the second co-defendant to plead guilty in the case, after bail bondsman Scott Hall.
The other 17 co-defendants have all pleaded not guilty. Powell’s guilty plea came days before her trial was scheduled to begin Monday. Another co-defendant, lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, who is charged with developing the scheme to recruit fake electors, still has a trial scheduled Monday.
While Powell was involved in a separate part of the conspiracy from Chesebro, Banzhaf said her guilty plea could affect him because he continues to face charges with a five-year minimum sentence and no opportunity for a federal pardon.
"I think it's also likely to convince Chesebro because he's in exactly the same boat," Banzhaf said. "Also, it's going to leave him standing alone in the courtroom. If the two of them were tried together at least they have each other, so to speak, a little bit of mutual support. Now he's going to be on his own and his attorney's going to have to work twice as hard."
Prosecutors initially charged Powell with conspiring with Hall and others to access election equipment without authorization and hired computer forensics firm SullivanStrickler to send a team to Coffee County, to copy software and data from voting machines and computers there.
The indictment said an unnamed person sent an email to a top SullivanStrickler executive and instructed him to send all data copied from Dominion Voting Systems equipment in Coffee County to an unidentified lawyer associated with Powell and the Trump campaign.
No place was safe for more than 2 million Palestinians on Thursday as Israeli bombs slammed across the Gaza Strip, including parts of the Palestinian territory that Israel had declared "safe zones."
At least 12 people were killed and dozens wounded Thursday when a residential building in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis was struck, medical personnel at Nasser Hospital said. The intensified shelling came one day after Israel agreed to allow limited shipments of humanitarian aid into southern Gaza from Egypt.
"Israeli Air Forces continued to strike southern areas despite the directive for people in #Gaza to move south," the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) tweeted. The agency said at least 14 of its own staff had been killed and nine more wounded − adding that the "actual number is likely to be much higher" − in less than two weeks since a stunning, bloody incursion of Hamas militants killed more than 1,000 Israeli citizens and fueled military reprisals from Israel.
The commander of the Hamas-led National Security Forces, Maj. Gen. Jihad Muheisen, was killed in an Israeli strike on his Gaza City home along with some relatives, Hamas said. Israel Defense Forces says it is attacking Hamas militants wherever they hide in Gaza and has accused the militants of taking shelter among the civilian population.
The death toll of Israelis and Palestinians surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five wars involving the narrow, densely populated strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.

Developments:
∎ More than 100 retired U.S. generals have signed an open letter from the Washinton-based Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs calling on President Biden and Congress to give Israel all the support it needs militarily, diplomatically and logistically against the "Iran-backed terrorist threats that surround it on all sides."
∎Hamas’ spokesman Wael Abu Omar said no aid trucks or road repair equipment had entered Gaza from the Egypt border crossing as of Thursday afternoon. The aid deal struck Wednesday had included a stipulation that roads essential to the flow of aid would first be repaired.
∎Hamas fighters likely fired North Korean weapons during their Oct. 7 assault on Israel, a militant video and weapons seized by Israel show, despite Pyongyang’s denials that it arms the militant group. South Korean officials, two experts on North Korean arms and an Associated Press analysis of weapons captured on the battlefield by Israel point toward Hamas using Pyongyang’s F-7 rocket-propelled grenade, a shoulder-fired weapon that fighters typically use against armored vehicles.
∎ The death toll in Gaza climbed to at least 3,785 people Thursday, the Gaza Health Ministry said. Over 1,500 children and 1,000 women were among those killed; at least 12,493 people have been injured, the ministry said. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, mostly civilians slain during Hamas’ bloody incursion on Oct. 7.
∎Israeli authorities said Thursday they had notified the families of 203 people believed held by Hamas militants. The number of known hostages has crept higher almost daily.
A U.S. cargo plane arrived in Israel carrying the initial shipment of armored vehicles designated to replace vehicles damaged during the war, the Israel Ministry of Defense said Thursday. Armored ambulances, trucks, and mechanical engineering equipment are expected to arrive in coming days, the ministry said. The first delivery came the day after President Joe Biden's historic trip to Tel Aviv, where he pledged the U.S. would stand by Israel and provide whatever is needed for it to defend itself in its war with Hamas. Biden also said he would seek congressional approval of an "unprecedented support package" to bolster Israel's defense.
Biden also pledged $100 million in U.S. funding for humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
As war in Israel, Gaza rages onAs war in Israel, Gaza rages on, President Biden is having a moment
More than a million people have fled their homes in the Gaza Strip ahead of an expected Israel invasion that seeks to eliminate Hamas’ leadership after its deadly incursion. Aid groups warn an Israeli ground offensive could hasten a humanitarian crisis. About 300,000 Israelis have been internally displaced since the start of the war, the Times of Israel reports, citing Israel Democracy Institute research. Most are from southern Israel in the Gaza border towns where Hamas carried out its murderous rampage.
President Joe Biden has made a sudden transformation from a political figure whose commitment to Israel was often questioned by conservative critics inside and outside the Jewish state to arguably the world's leading champion of Israel outside the Middle East. Biden's actions and words since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, capped by a dramatic visit to Israel on Wednesday, have been lauded even by many of Biden's biggest skeptics in Israel as he stands in solidarity with Israel and pledges "unprecedented" military assistance.
"Israelis were hungry for a father figure that will hug them and show empathy. And the president has done that in such a way that really touched every Israeli," said Nimrod Novik, a former foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and now a fellow with the Israel Policy Forum.

Gaza hospital explosion:How a deadly blast near al-Ahli center unfolded
Palestinian Americans are seeing two fronts in the Israel-Hamas war: one is the bloodshed in the Middle East. The other is emotional backlash from bigotry and hate in the U.S. A U.S. Department of Justice hate crime investigation into the fatal stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American Muslim boy in Illinois is one of several incidents of alleged hate being directed at Palestinian Americans, allies and people who look like them since the war began.
The community feels under siege, American Muslims for Palestine executive director Osama Abu Irshaid told USA TODAY. But at the same time, wants to show support and express grief in the war crisis.
“They’re not out there to threaten anyone," Irshaid said. "They’re not there to delegitimize another narrative. They’re out there to assert a narrative that is being diminished."

Battle against hate:Violence, bigotry toward Palestinian Americans spiking across U.S.
The Israel Defense Forces, also known as the IDF, is the national military of Israel. It has three branches: the army, navy and air force. It is a conscripted military service, meaning Israel mandates IDF service for Jewish, Druze and Circassian citizens over the age of 18, with some exceptions. It was established in 1948, two weeks after Israel became an independent country.
Before the war began, the IDF had 169,500 active troops and was the 28th largest military in the world by active personnel, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military Balance 2023. There were also 465,000 reserve personnel to supplement active military forces if deemed necessary.

More:Biden: Gaza to get aid by Friday; US says Israel not to blame for hospital blast. Live updates
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, and several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for the establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material, and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.

WASHINGTON — The nation in its 16th day without a speaker of the House, and Republican lawmakers have made seemingly no progress towards electing a new, permanent leader. 
Instead, on Thursday Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, appeared to support a plan empowering Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., as speaker up until January to get the House moving again. McHenry has already been serving as an interim speaker with limited powers.
On Wednesday, Jordan, lost a second speaker election. Compared to the first ballot, Jordan lost additional support from House Republicans during the second vote, endangering his bid for the speakership. 
The push to grant McHenry additional powers came after Republican holdouts vowed not to support Jordan. Steve Womack, R-Ark., one of the holdouts, told reporters Wednesday evening he did not see a path forward for Jordan to become speaker. 
Follow along for live updates from USA TODAY on the speaker fight.
Meanwhile, just a one-minute walk away from a closed-door meeting where House Republicans are debating a resolution to empower McHenry, House Democrats are huddling to discuss next steps.
The move to empower McHenry as a temporary speaker will almost certainly require a heavy lift from Democrats. Hard-right lawmakers have been leaving the GOP meeting furious and lambasting the resolution.– Ken Tran
A roll call vote to determine attendance in the House, scheduled for noon, has been postponed as lawmakers continue to debate a resolution that would empower McHenry as an interim speaker.
– Ken Tran
Jordan will back empowering McHenry as temporary speaker up until January, according to a source familiar.
In the meantime, Jordan will continue to run for speaker and work to shore up support over the next few months.
– Ken Tran
Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., chair of the House Freedom Caucus, a loose coalition of hard-right lawmakers, told reporters he would oppose empowering McHenry with temporary powers.
The resolution to make McHenry effectively an interim speaker "sets a bad precedent," Perry said.

House Republicans are currently meeting behind closed doors to discuss a resolution from Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, to temporarily empower McHenry as acting speaker.− Ken Tran
Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat representing Washington state, currently serves as president pro tempore of the Senate.
Without an official speaker of the House, Murray was next in line for the presidency after Vice President Kamala Harris in the case of an emergency.

House Republicans will huddle in a closed-door conference meeting at 11 a.m. Thursday to discuss next steps.
The meeting comes as Jordan faces growing opposition to his bid for speaker and talks increase about giving temporary speaker Patrick McHenry more power.

As Jim Jordan still faces stiff opposition from GOP holdouts after failing two consecutive ballots, it is unclear when the House will hold a third speaker election.The House will come into session at noon for a roll call vote to determine attendance, but it's uncertain when a speaker vote will be held.
Jordan, R-Ohio, told reporters Wednesday he intends to stay in the race and expected a vote at noon Thursday. But as it remains clear Jordan has no path towards the 217 votes he needs to become speaker, the timing of the third speaker election is up in the air.

Lawmakers were originally expected to begin proceedings at noon Thursday in Washington, but timing could change if Republicans meet in conference first. When the House reconvenes, you can follow along here.

Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., one of the moderate GOP lawmakers opposing Jordan, told USA TODAY the House is in its state of paralysis by the fault of the conservative hardliners who have overturned "precedent."
Hard-right lawmakers, Lawler told USA TODAY, "set a new precedent within this congress." The New York Republican referenced multiple times ultraconservatives tanked rule votes, traditionally procedural votes that until this year, never failed.
The historic move to remove McCarthy from the speakership, Lawler added, was done with "no real planning," resulting in the gridlock that has consumed House Republicans.
− Ken Tran
Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., was chosen to be acting House speaker from a succession list that McCarthy provided to a House clerk in January in case his seat became vacant.
McHenry is serving his 10th term in Congress and represents the 10th congressional district in North Carolina. He is a McCarthy ally and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, a role that helped him negotiate the debt limit deal earlier this year.
He was appointed in 2015 by then House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., to serve as the Chief Deputy Whip, helping Scalise build agreement around a conservative policy agenda for the House Republican Conference. 
−Sudiksha Kochi
Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., one of the GOP holdouts against Jordan voted for former speaker John Boehner on Wednesday in the second speaker election as a protest vote.
The vote drew some applause from House Democrats.
Boehner served as House speaker from 2011 to 2015 and was virtually removed by House Republicans, led by Jordan and the House Freedom Caucus, who threatened to oust him from the speakership akin to McCarthy’s ejection earlier this month. Boehner ultimately resigned in the face of those threats.

No. 
Technically, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries could be elected, as there are no requirements for the speaker to be from the majority party (or even a member of Congress). In both rounds of voting this week, Jeffries has received 212 votes, the full backing of House Democrats and more than Rep. Jim Jordan both times.
However, the New York Democrat would still need five more votes to hit the necessary 217.
Despite infighting among Republicans, it's very doubtful any lawmaker on the right, let alone five, will cast a vote across the aisle.
−Savannah Kuchar
The number of votes needed is determined by a majority of House lawmakers present and voting.
On Tuesday, that number was 217. Because no lawmaker received 217 votes in the first election, the speaker race continues today.
When the vote for speaker begins Wednesday, members will have a roll call vote to determine how many are present and voting − and how many votes are needed to win. Then they will be called on individually to cast their vote for a speaker.
Voting could last several rounds Wednesday or be postponed until another day if a speaker isn't elected during the second try.

Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., is prepared to "step up" and serve as House speaker to help lead the party out of the chaos both it and the nation currently face, his spokesman James Hogge said in an email to the Detriot Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.
"It’s becoming clear Rep. Jordan’s path is narrowing by the hour,” Hogge said. ““We cannot go another day without a Speaker. He simply doesn’t have the votes — we need to have a frank discussion as a conference about a path forward. If as a conference we see he can’t get the necessary votes to become Speaker, General Bergman is prepared to step up."
20 House Republicans voted against Jordan in the first House speaker election while 22 Republicans voted against him in the second election. Bergman supported Jordan in both rounds.
Bergman said on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday that “We need a leader to step up to unite the Republican conference, actually pass critical legislation, and move our Nation forward.”
−Paul Egan and Sudiksha Kochi
The second ballot was another setback for Jordan’s bid for speaker. Twenty-two GOP lawmakers voted against Jordan, an increase from the 20 that opposed him on Tuesday. They are:

Ready or not, winter is coming — But how bad is it going to be? Federal forecasters from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center gave us their answer Thursday morning in an annual winter outlook.
NOAA said the U.S. winter of 2023-24 will likely be dominated by the effects of what could be a powerful El Niño. That means a mild, dry winter is likely on tap for much of the northern tier of the U.S., while the southeastern U.S. should see a wetter-than-average winter.
The center's forecast covers the months of December, January and February, which is known as meteorological winter.
Warmer-than-average temperatures are favored across the northern tier of the U.S. and much of the far West, NOAA said. The greatest odds for warmer-than-average conditions are in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and northern New England. No parts of the nation are forecast to to be colder-than-average, according to the forecast.
As for precipitation, wetter-than-average conditions are most likely in northern Alaska, portions of the West from California to the south-central Rockies, the southern Plains, Gulf Coast, Southeast and lower mid-Atlantic, NOAA predicts.
“An enhanced southern jet stream and associated moisture often present during strong El Niño events supports high odds for above-average precipitation for the Gulf Coast, lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast states this winter,” said Jon Gottschalck of the Climate Prediction Center.
The wet conditions across the South should help ease the drought in the region: "El Niño, with its enhanced precipitation, is expected to provide drought relief to the southern U.S. during the next few months,” said Brad Pugh, of the Climate Prediction Center.
As for where a dry winter is likely, the greatest odds for drier-than-average conditions are forecast in portions of the northern Rockies and central Great Lakes region, especially for Michigan and northern Ohio and Indiana.
The main factor that federal climate scientists use to forecast winter weather is the strength of El Niño or La Niña, climate patterns that affect weather in the U.S. and around the world. The entire natural climate cycle is officially known as the El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which swings between warmer and cooler seawater in the tropical Pacific Ocean.
(El Niño is unusually warm water in the tropical Pacific Ocean, while La Niña means cooler-than-average water in the Pacific.)
This El Niño, which began in June, is predicted to last through the winter. It could be a "historically strong" one, the Climate Prediction Center said, potentially rivaling those from 2015-16 and 1997-98.
Let it snow?:Winter predictions start as El Niño strengthens. Here's what forecasters say.
The forecast released Thursday only predicts where above or below normal temperatures – and above or below normal precipitation – are most likely.
This winter forecast does not specify how much precipitation will fall as rain, snow or ice, only that more or less is likely overall. Snow forecasts depend upon the strength and track of winter storms, which generally cannot be predicted more than a week in advance, the center has said in the past.
As for the 50 million Americans that live in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, where big snowstorms typically bring the most angst, the climate center does not give a specific forecast for how much snow will fall.
How cold and snowy will US winter be?:Why October snow in Siberia could hold the answer.
Climate patterns such as the Arctic Oscillation – which can unleash intensely cold temperatures across the central and eastern U.S. – aren't included in this official forecast at this time since they can't be predicted more than one or two weeks in advance.
Other large-scale climate patterns in the atmosphere that can influence winter weather include the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can affect the number of heavy rain events along the West Coast. It can also contribute to other extreme events in the U.S., including Arctic air outbreaks during the winter months across the central and eastern portions of the nation, the CPC says.
The forecast does also not factor in Siberian snow cover, which other forecasters use as the basis for their winter weather forecasts.
This is the third story in a series exploring grief, how people face it, cope with it and heal from it.
Click here to read the first installment: This family went through an unimaginable tragedy. How YouTube helped. And here for the second: At 25 she found out she had the breast cancer gene. Now, she's grieving motherhood.
Lisa Bowman had everything going for her − until she didn't.
The now 56-year-old was the global chief marketing officer for United Way. United Way, an education, economic mobility and health-focused nonprofit, recruited her.
What should've been a dream job spiraled into a nightmare: she alleged she was sexually harassed at work, and more than 20 former employees of the company said "sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation is commonplace," at the company, according to a 2021 HuffPost report. The nonprofit fired Bowman in January 2020, months after she reported the harassment. Multiple claims have been filed with the EEOC; United Way told USA TODAY it doesn't comment on matters of employment. The CEO of United Way resigned as the chaos swirled.
But Bowman didn't just lose her job. She lost much more.
"The loss of my job was really that loss of my identity," she says. "All of a sudden, I went from being Lisa Bowman, CMO of the world's largest nonprofit where anybody would take my call, people were beating down the door to talk to me, to all of a sudden just being Lisa Bowman, private citizen, with no identity, so to speak. And that was a really, really tough thing for me to navigate."
Grief doesn't apply to death alone. It comes in a series of shapes and sizes different than you might expect. And all can coexist. (You can share yours with us at the bottom of this article).
"There's room enough in the world for all these losses, and one doesn't take away from the other," says David Kessler, grief expert and founder of Grief.com.
Bowman says her grief affected her as a woman: "When I talk about the grief over the loss of a job, I think for women, as we fight so hard sometimes to get to executive levels, and those C-suite positions, when we get there, that job becomes an integral part of our identity," she says. "And so we identify very closely with our role."
She attempted to push through her grief – a "fake it 'til you make it" mentality – the same way she dealt with it at 26 following the death of her mother.
"She never got to see certain things happen in my life. She wasn't there for a wedding, for example, or to see the career trajectory that I ended up with, which have largely been influenced by her," Bowman says. "And in some cases, this is kind of the same thing. I'm missing out on all of those things, because of this loss of a job. And that in and of itself – it's grief. Every time something happens, and I have a financial challenge, it brings it all back."
Bowman confided in friends and family in lieu of professional help. While none could relate to her quandary, they listened to her. Heard her cry.
She later poured those thoughts into a book – "Harasshole" – which, while therapeutic, made it that much harder for her to get a job. Bowman previously had a 15-year stint in executive-level marketing roles at UPS but now freelances.
"It's made it very, very difficult for me to find employment," she says. "I have candidly applied for over 1000 jobs. I've had people tell me that they would love to hire me and they can't, because they can't take a risk with me. I've had job offers rescinded when people have found out about this."
Another kind of grief: missed opportunities.
Bowman's grief is not more or less than any other type of grief. "There's a context to think about it, as sometimes we approach grief like it's a pie," Kessler says. "And it goes wrong if we think, Wait, wait, you're taking some of the pie on your job loss. But I need a lot of it because my spouse died. And that isn't how grief works."
Some might call Bowman's job loss "disenfranchised grief" – a loss not openly acknowledged, socially mourned or publicly supported, according to Loree Johnson, a licensed marriage and family therapist. It's grief felt on an individual level not necessarily seen by others.
Plus, "the emotions can be the same, regarding all kinds of loss," says Amy Morin, psychotherapist and the host of a podcast. "Someone who lost their job may feel sad, anxious, and a bit disoriented, which might be the same feelings someone experiences when they lose a friend or relative."
Read next:At 25 she found out she had the breast cancer gene. Now, she's grieving motherhood.
Today, Bowman's grief hasn't dissipated. It's morphed: "Similar to the loss of a person, the grief doesn't go away. It's just that you get used to carrying it. So it doesn't feel quite as heavy."
For those going through a similar crisis, Bowman offers these words of advice: "You have to realize that it's not your role that defines who you are. It's who you are that makes you you. It's your skills, it's your capabilities, it's the value you provide."
Sad:Her son died, and she felt alone. In her grief, she found YouTube.
Republican Rep. Jim Jordan lost votes on his second attempt to become House speaker, an embarrassing setback for a party that seems to specialize in embarrassing itself.
Since ousting former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier this month, the Republican caucus has tried and failed to vote in Rep. Steve Scalise and Jordan, leaving the House leaderless with the clock ticking toward a potential government shutdown and war breaking out in the Middle East.
It’s clearly time for the Republican Party to consider an outsider for the role of speaker of the House, so in the interest of bipartisan helpfulness, I’ve prepared the following LinkedIn-inspired job posting they can use to identify potential candidates.
You’re welcome, Republicans, and good luck filling the position!
Do Republicans want this?Trump is slamming Israel and babbling about Barack Obama. Who would vote for that mess?
💼Title: House Speaker/Republican
👷Job Type: Full-Time with many, many days off
🌏Location: Washington, D.C., and Fox News headquarters in New York City
Job Description:
The Republican Party is seeking an enthusiastic, qualified (or unqualified) conservative interested in leading a not-particularly-dedicated team of politicians in the U.S. House of Representatives through a time of ideological uncertainty. The ideal background would be a person who can unite people with varying views on the importance of democracy and rally them to accomplish as little as possible while still yelling into television cameras in a manner that sounds serious. This position comes with no benefits and, in fact, many drawbacks, but it is a chance for an outgoing and energetic ne’er-do-well to prove themselves to be slightly better than former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and considerably better than failed House Speaker candidate Rep. Jim Jordan, a bar so low even earthworms can clear it.
Responsibilities: 
Qualifications:
Compensation:
Exact compensation may vary based on whether you last more than a week or so before being unceremoniously voted out for not making Gaetz happy enough.
Base salary: $223,500 a year
Perks include free flights on donor jets and a complimentary copy of Donald Trump Jr.’s book “Triggered.”

A Marine is being held by Camp Lejeune base law enforcement officials on suspicion of being involved in the homicide of another Marine, the base said.
The suspect was taken into custody at about 10:15 p.m. Wednesday night, according to a statement from the base, after an incident in an on-base barracks room earlier in the evening.
The statement referred to the Marine's death as a homicide, but did not provide any additional information, including the cause of death. The statement said more information would be provided as it becomes available.
'A real tight-knit group':Military unit mourns after 2 soldiers killed in Alaska vehicle crash
The incident comes two days before the base was scheduled to conduct its annual emergency response exercise.
The exercise "provides an opportunity for tenant commands to develop and exercise emergency security procedures," according to a news release from the base.
The release says the exercise also provides "realistic training opportunities meant to increase the installation's emergency response efforts, command and control, and security capabilities."
According to its website, Camp Lejeune has been the home of "expeditionary forces in readiness" since 1941, and has become the home base for the II Marine Expeditionary Force, 2nd Marine Division, 2nd Marine Logistics Group and other combat units and support commands.
The base, located in Onslow County in southeastern North Carolina, occupies over 150,000 acres and has 14 miles of beach on the Atlantic Ocean.
Natalee Holloway case:Joran van der Sloot confesses to 2005 murder of Natalee Holloway in Aruba: Court records
Palestinian Americans are seeing two fronts in the Israel-Hamas war: one is the bloodshed in the Middle East. The other is emotional backlash from bigotry and hate in the U.S.
A U.S. Department of Justice hate crime investigation into the fatal stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American Muslim boy in Illinois is one of several incidents of alleged hate being directed at Palestinian Americans, allies and people who look like them since the war began.
Among them:
American Muslims for Palestine executive director Osama Abu Irshaid told USA TODAY his team is facing a myriad of fears and forms of grief, as they mourn familial losses, the collective mourning of human loss, and mounting fears of violence fueled by anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim bigotry in the US. One staffer has lost 18 family members to recent attacks in Gaza, Irshaid said.
“There are attempts to criminalize our voices,” Irshaid said, noting that Palestinian supporters, including Christian, Black, Jewish and other voices are being stifled.
The community feels under siege, Irshaid said, but at the same time, wants to show support and express grief in the war crisis.
“They’re not out there to threaten anyone. They’re not there to delegitimize another narrative. They’re out there to assert a narrative that is being diminished,” Irshaid said.
Joseph Milburn, a staff attorney at CAIR-Chicago, said the nonprofit civil rights organization has received an influx of calls since the start of the war from victims of hate crimes, including visibly Muslim women who have been taunted and targeted for slurs in public places. He also noted a lack of action from elected officials to protect Palestinian Americans and adjacent communities.
“In the best-case scenario, perhaps some politicians aren’t aware of the needs of marginalized communities. Or, in the worst-case scenario, they simply don’t care,” Milburn said.
In a recent alleged hate crime, 6-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume was fatally stabbed 26 times in his Illinois home. His mother, Haanan Shahin, 32, was stabbed more than a dozen times and survived with severe injuries. The family’s landlord, 71-year-old Joseph Czuba, was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and two counts of hate crime.
CAIR-Chicago said the Muslim family had lived at the home owned by Czuba for two years with no reported problems. According to text messages between Shahin and the boy's father that were shared with the CAIR-Chicago, Czuba yelled "You Muslims must die" during the attack.
Czuba's wife, Mary, said her husband listened to a "conservative talk radio on a regular basis" and had been "heavily" interested in recent events in Israel, according to new court documents.
Presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a campaign event the United States should not take in any refugees from the Gaza Strip.
“If you look at how they behave, not all of them are Hamas, but they are all antisemitic,” he said.
In a social media post on X, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul condemned a Palestinian rally in Times Square, calling it “abhorrent and morally repugnant.”
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Fox News: “We’re in a religious war here. I am with Israel. Do whatever the hell you have to do to defend yourself. Level the place.” 
In statements released since the beginning of the war, President Joe Biden continued to offer unequivocal support for Israel and condemned violence against Israelis but did not do the same for Palestinians.
"The United States and the State of Israel are inseparable partners, and I affirmed to Prime Minister Netanyahu again when we spoke yesterday that the United States will continue to make sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself and its people," Biden said on Oct. 9.
Following the stabbings on Saturday, Biden released a statement on the "horrific act of hate."
"As Americans, we must come together and reject Islamophobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred.  I have said repeatedly that I will not be silent in the face of hate.  We must be unequivocal. There is no place in America for hate against anyone," Biden said.
To US Palestinian Community Network national chair Hatem Abudayyeh, Biden’s comments were “too little, too late.”
In a private call with State Department officials Monday, Arab American and Muslim leaders expressed outrage over the Biden administration’s rhetoric in recent days, POLITICO first reported. Leaders said the demonization of Palestinians, and of Arabs in general, had given way for rise in hatred against them in the US. They also noted calls for a ceasefire or restraint were absent from Biden's remarks.
CAIR said in an analysis of statements that hundreds of U.S. corporations, including CEOs of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Pfizer, and JPMorgan Chase, condemned the attack against Israelis but failed to do the same for attacks against Palestinian civilians. 
Experts said statements that only acknowledge violence against one side imply the other side is either not facing violence or does not matter. 
“No group should be demonized,” Milburn said. “Jewish people should be protected and respected, and so should Muslims and Arabs and South Asians and everyone else.”
Suzanne Adely, president of the National Lawyers Guild, said there have been increasing reports over the last week of the Federal Bureau of Investigation visiting local mosques across the country and contacting individual Palestinian activists who had never had such an encounter before.
“It’s part of this larger onslaught of attack against Palestinians, Muslims and those that are supporting Palestine,” Adely said.
This is not the first instance Muslims have reported increased surveillance from the FBI. In June, CAIR released a report on FBI’s use of its terrorism watchlist, finding that 98% of the names on the watchlist were Muslim names, despite the fact that Muslims only make up about 1.1% of the U.S. population, according to the Pew Research Center. 
“An individual’s watchlist status is used by government agencies to harass and humiliate people when they travel, to outright forbid people from flying, to deny individuals licenses and permits, to refuse to hire people or fire people already employed, to delay or deny visas and applications for U.S. citizenship or a US passport and subject the innocent people on the list to dangerous and invasive law enforcement actions,” CAIR said.
“All of what is happening sort of builds some kind of false narrative of who Palestinian supporters are in order to justify the US’ continued and shameful support for the genocide of the Palestinian people,” Adely said.
Passwords might be one of the biggest tech frustrations. Make them too hard, and they're impossible to remember. Too easy, and your accounts are practically wide open.
You could use a password manager or your browser's built-in option to remember your logins. Here's how to find saved passwords in your browser.
Those solutions aren't perfect, of course. Password managers get hacked, and anyone with the know-how can access your saved browser options. No wonder tech companies are working to welcome us to a future sans passwords.
I write about the latest tech gear, security alerts and digital life hacks in my daily emails. Join 600K+ who get the Current each day. It's free!
Woof! It starts with the FIDO Alliance
That stands for Fast IDentity Online. Big tech companies launched the industry association in 2013 to build a better system than passwords we have to keep track of and type in. Now we're seeing more start to roll it out, and Google's beta testing worked so well that the company just made it the standard way to protect your account.
Before we get to how to use passkeys, let's do a deep dive into how they work.
What is a passkey, and how does it work?
A passkey is a personalized FIDO credential (like your fingerprint or face scan) that lives securely on your device. You use that instead of a username and password to unlock your accounts.
Another bonus: No more sticky notes with passwords on your monitor. Passkeys also eliminate the daily "Which password did I use here?" dilemma. Naturally, it'll be faster and easier to log in.
But is it safe to use? Glad you're asking. The unique structure of passkeys makes them near-impenetrable, unlike passwords – which are notoriously easy to crack. Since they're stored on your local device, passkeys can't be hacked or guessed like passwords.
And there's no concern of a hacker getting their hands on one of your passwords and opening the keys to the castle since each device has its unique passkey. That's a far cry from passwords, and studies show most people rely on only a handful of passwords for all their accounts.
Is paid social media the future? If you want privacy, probably.
Want to try it out?
If you're sick of typing in credentials all day, you can set up passkeys with your Google account.
Note: Passkeys are automatically created for Google devices, but you must set them up for any other gadgets you use to access your account(s). You need to do this individually on each device you want to give access to. Remember, a passkey lives on that device, so it's not just an accountwide setting.
◾ Go to g.co/passkeys.
◾ Tap Get passkeys and sign in.
◾ Select Use passkeys, then follow the onscreen prompts.
You'll be prompted to log in without your password in certain situations. My advice: Use biometric authentication (your fingerprint or face) anywhere you can. It's much more secure than a PIN.
Fear not, Apple folks
You can use passkeys with your iPhone too. These work through the iCloud Keychain. Make sure you have that turned on and two-factor authentication enabled to use passkeys. Note: To use passkeys, iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS 13, or tvOS 16 (or later) is required.
Depending on the website, browser, or app you're using, saving a passkey to your iPhone and iCloud Keychain usually consists of these steps:
◾ On your iPhone, go to the sign-in screen for a supported website or app and do one of the following: If setting up a new account: Tap the button or link for setting up new accounts, then follow the onscreen instructions.
◾ When you see the option to save a passkey for the account, tap Continue. Your passkey is saved.
Note: If you don't see a passkey option, the app or website doesn't currently support passkeys.
To sign in to an account on your iPhone with a passkey:
◾ On your iPhone, go to the website or app and tap the account name field on the sign-in screen.
◾ Tap the suggested account name that appears at the bottom of the screen or near the top of the keyboard. If the account name doesn't appear, or you want to use a different one, enter it.
◾ Use Face ID or Touch ID to complete sign-in. If you didn't set up Face ID or Touch ID on your iPhone, enter your device passcode (the code you use to unlock your iPhone).
The passkey you saved completes the sign-in automatically.
When using a device not associated with your Apple ID, you can still sign in to an account using the passkey stored on your iPhone. Here's how:
◾ On the other device, go to the website or app and enter your user name in the account name field on the sign-in screen.
◾ Select Other options, Passkey from nearby device, or similar, then follow the onscreen instructions to display a QR code on the screen.
◾ Use your iPhone camera to scan the QR code.
The passkey that's saved to iCloud Keychain completes the sign-in automatically.
Now, onward, with your safe new logins.

Julia Fox is opening up about her "overwhelming" relationship with Ye, formerly Kanye West.
Fox appeared on "The Drew Barrymore Show" Wednesday where she discussed her memoir "Down the Drain," including her whirlwind two-month romance with a man she dubs "the artist."
The model and actress said Ye would request frequent phone calls and attention that it became "unsustainable" balancing the relationship and parenting her 2-year-old son Valentino, who she shares with ex Peter Artemiev.
"My son has to be first. It just became too much, like I didn’t sign up to have two babies," she told host Drew Barrymore. "Ultimately I think he needed a full-time person and I just couldn’t be full-time."
Fox added: "I’d have to change diapers and so I bought a pair of AirPods so I could keep it in while I was doing mom stuff. It was just — it was so overwhelming and so unsustainable."
"I think I just realized very quickly it just wasn’t gonna be sustainable because ultimately I cannot put anybody else first," the "Uncut Gems" star said.
In Fox's memoir, which came out on Oct. 10, she gave readers a behind-the-scenes look at her high-profile relationships.
"People ask me what it’s like to be this famous. Truth is, I’m not a celebrity and I don’t claim that title. I’m an artist in the role of a lifetime, playing Me. And nothing about my life has changed," she wrote. "Being sexy had been my identity for so long, and I was consumed by it. I’m unlearning all the brainwashing and learning to love myself for more than just the way I look."
In the climax of "Down the Drain," Fox offers several details of what it was like to date Ye, whom she doesn't reference by name. From context clues, including a detail about the artist being on "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" and having an estranged wife, it's clear that she is talking about the rapper.
Julia Fox opens up about Ye 'using' her,winning 'lottery' with 'Uncut Gems' role in new book
Fox also notes that she never signed a nondisclosure agreement, despite his multiple requests that she do so.
It doesn't take long for Fox to grow disillusioned with the fashion try-ons exclusively involving items approved by the artist. She recounts feeling uncomfortable after he casually offers to "get you a boob job" as she tries on a slinky top that doesn't fit right.
Eventually, as the artist seems to be soliciting more publicity for the two of them, Fox writes, "I feel like he’s using me in some weird, twisted game. It makes me feel dirty."

Julia Fox on Ye's antisemitic remarks:'I just feel so bad for everyone involved'
Russian authorities detained a Russian-American journalist Wednesday on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent, her employer said in a statement.
Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor with Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), a media organization funded by the U.S. government, has been held in a temporary detention facility since she was taken into custody on Wednesday in the western Russian city of Kazan, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. She is the second U.S. journalist detained in Russia this year.
Kurmasheva, who holds citizenship in Russia and the United States, traveled to Russia in May for a family emergency. While awaiting her return flight on June 2, she was temporarily detained and her dual U.S. and Russian passports were confiscated, RFE/RL said. She's not been able to leave the country since.
Initially fined for failing to register her U.S. passport with Russian authorities, Kurmasheva was awaiting the return of her passports when the new charge was announced on Wednesday.
She is now being accused of "failing to register herself as a foreign agent in her capacity as a person collecting information on Russian military activities that 'could be used against the security of the Russian Federation,'" according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. She faces up to five years in prison if found guilty, the nonprofit said, citing the Russian Criminal Code.
Kurmasheva lives in Prague with her husband and two children.
A program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists called the charges against Kurmasheva "spurious" and demanded her immediate release. “Journalism is not a crime and Kurmasheva’s detention is yet more proof that Russia is determined to stifle independent reporting," said Gulnoza Said, the nonprofit's Europe and Central Asia program coordinator.
"Alsu is a highly respected colleague, devoted wife, and dedicated mother to two children," said Jeffrey Gedmin, the acting president of RFE/RL in a statement. "She needs to be released so she can return to her family immediately."
In March, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was arrested in Russia for alleged spying, which he and The Journal deny. He has appeared in court multiple times and remains imprisoned in Moscow.

The latest storm of the Atlantic hurricane season has officially formed into Tropical Storm Tammy, bringing weather watches to several islands in the Caribbean Sea.
Tammy formed late Wednesday afternoon and is expected to gradually strengthen over the next few days as it approaches the Leeward Islands. The National Hurricane Center predicts that Tammy could possibly bring tropical storm conditions starting Friday and reach near hurricane intensity early Saturday.
The NHC says Tammy is expected to turn west-northwest Thursday and northwest Friday, sucking up the warm waters to grow to near-hurricane strength by the time it reaches the islands. The NHC predicts more watches and warnings will be necessary Thursday evening, as heavy rainfall could produce flash floods or mudslides.
Here is what else to know about Hurricane Tammy, according to Thursday's 8 a.m. ET NHC advisory:
2023 hurricane season:Tammy is born and storm season odds shift in our favor; but a spooky pattern may emerge
A Tropical Storm Watch, meaning tropical storm conditions are possible within 48 hours, are in effect for the following places:
Special note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts. 
With Tropical Storm Tammy named, that leaves two names remaining on the 2023 list of storms: Vince and Whitney. Hurricane season doesn't end until Nov. 30, although storms can and do form any time.
This season has been above the historical average when it comes to named storms. During an average hurricane season, 14 named storms form in the Atlantic basin, which covers the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico.
The peak of the season is Sept. 10, with the most activity happening between mid-August and mid-October, according to the hurricane center.

The rhythm and energy of this song may match the excitement some feel for this beloved fruit. People around the globe go bananas, for, well, bananas. 
Most people are familiar with the sweet flavor and soft texture of the banana – but some may wonder about its nutritional value – like its upsides, its downsides, and if we can actually eat them every day. We connected with Kara Burnstine, MSRD, LDN, CDCES, Registered Nutritionist and Certified Diabetes Educator at Pritikin Longevity Center to find out everything you need to know about bananas. 
Although bananas have many benefits, there are three main nutritional benefits that we want to focus on. 
Are you getting enough potassium?Here's what to know about the mineral, how to get more
The main drawback of bananas is the sugar content. Even though it is natural, too much sugar can lead to issues, particularly if you’re a diabetic or if you have weight loss goals.
Burnstine explains, “All fruits are not created equal in terms of calories and sugar content. Although the sugar content in fruit is natural and preferred, bananas have a higher cost in terms of calories and sugar content than some other fruits, for example, berries."
She adds, “Those with digestive disorders may have trouble digesting the sugars in the banana and they can cause some GI distress. It's a good idea to eat the banana before it gets all spotted like a leopard. The more spotted, the more ripened the banana becomes and increases the sugar content of the banana.”
Burnstine says the short answer is: yes. However, she urges you to think about some of the caveats,
“Keep the portions small, have them with fibrous foods like vegetables, and/or pair them with a healthy protein or plant-based fat to increase satiety and dilute sugar concentration.” She gives some examples of what she does at her practice, “Some great pairings would be Greek yogurt with a banana or a handful of nuts with a banana.” 
Additionally, the American Heart Association recommends, “Don’t go bananas. But maybe eat one.” They concurred that bananas have lots of wonderful nutrients, but that some people need to worry about the sugar or potassium content, particularly if you have kidney or heart disease.

A fun outing at a pecan festival in Texas took a scary turn when a gust of wind launched a carnival ride car into the air and left its operator dangling 30 feet above the ground.
The ride operator was helping 12-year-old Juliana Bernal get into one of the cars on The Bullet at the 54th annual Groves Pecan Festival on Sunday afternoon in Groves, Texas, about 90 miles east of Houston near the Louisiana state line, reported KMBT-TV
A strong gust of wind suddenly propelled the car into the air with Juliana inside as the ride operator held onto the door to keep it shut and protect her, the station reported. He managed to do that all while the compartment turned 180 degrees and stalled 30 feet from the ground.
Video footage of the accident shared by KFDM-TV showed the operator hanging from the ride with his legs dangling in the air as people screamed and watched in horror.
Now he's being hailed as a hero.
Video:Day of adventure turns into nightmare for Canadian amusement park riders
Juliana's mother, Caress Muraira, told KMBT-TV that watching the incident unfold was one of the scariest moments of her life.
"It started going slow at first and he was trying to stop it, her door wasn't closed," she said. "So I started freaking out. As he went to close the door he just kind of flew up with it. My daughter was up there and talking to him saying, 'Please hang on. Don't fall.'"
Juliana also kept telling Muraira: "Mommy, I'm OK," she said.
It "felt like the longest time of my life," before employees were able to get the ride's motor going and lower the ride, bringing both the operator and Juliana to safety. Just before that the employees quickly removed a handful of children who were in a ground-level compartment of the ride.
The Bullet was shut down for the rest of the event.
Muraira said that she was immensely grateful to the ride operator for risking his life for her daughter.

Groves City Marshal Norman Reynolds told KMBT-TV that the ride operator was shaken up after the ordeal.
Muraira said that her daughter told her that she saw blood on the operator's fingers from where he was holding onto the ride.
A spokesperson for the festival organizer, the Groves Chamber of Commerce, told USA TODAY on Wednesday that the ride operator was fine and that they are not aware of any injuries.
Organized by the Groves Chamber of Commerce since 1969, the Groves Pecan Festival is a community-wide celebration that coincides with the yearly pecan harvest. Pecans are an integral part of the Groves landscape and have been a focal point for community growth, the chamber of commerce says.
A spate of recent incidents related to amusement rides and attraction has left riders stuck or injured.
On Sept. 29, an 8-year-old boy sustained significant injuries when he was "sucked out" of his seat on a ride called The Storm at the State Fair of Virginia.
In August, guests were forced to walk down a 200-plus-foot roller coaster at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio after the ride known as the Magnum XL experienced a mechanical issue.
Back in July, fairgoers in Crandon, Wisconsin, ended up in a terrifying predicament when a malfunction left riders stuck upside down for hours.
Just two days before that, a North Carolina amusement park closed one of its rollercoasters after guests noticed a crack in a support pillars and video showed pieces moving out of place as cars moved along the tracks.

Hamas and Israel have been blaming each other for a deadly blast at a Gaza hospital complex.
President Joe Biden backed up Israel’s statements on Wednesday as he visited Tel Aviv. Biden said he was “outraged and saddened” by the loss of life in Gaza City. But he said U.S. intelligence indicated that Israel was not behind the explosion.
Here's a look at what happened, and what the different parties are saying:
An explosion in a courtyard and parking lot adjacent to al-Ahli Hospital in a Gaza City suburb reportedly killed or injured hundreds of patients and people in the vicinity.
Mohammed Abu Selmia − general director of Shifa Hospital, where the wounded and dead were transferred after the explosion − said early Wednesday that he believed the death toll was close to 250, with hundreds more wounded, The Associated Press reported.
The American Friends of the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which operates the medical center, said in a statement Tuesday evening that hundreds of staff, patients, and refugees who were sheltering at Ahli Arab Hospital were killed and wounded.
Palestinians have been seeking refuge in and around hospitals from the Israeli bombardment of Gaza prompted by the Oct. 7 Hamas rampage that killed 1,400 people in Israeli territory. More than 3,000 people have been killed and more than 12,500 have been injured in Gaza, according to its health ministry.

The U.S. said Wednesday that its intelligence assessments indicated Israel was not behind the hospital explosion.
“While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,” National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement.
Air Force Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said separately that the Defense Department’s intelligence assessment is that Israel was not responsible for the explosion.
The Israeli military denied involvement and released video, audio and other information to support its claim that the explosion resulted from a misfired missile from the Islamic Jihad, a militant group that sometimes cooperates with Hamas and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. In a video posted to X, formerly Twitter, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) compares examples of craters caused by IDF ordnance to the damage near the hospital.
Israel Defense Forces posted a video claiming the rocket originated from Gaza. The footage was posted on X with text that reads: "RAW FOOTAGE: A rocket aimed at Israel misfired and exploded at 18:59 − the same moment a hospital was hit in Gaza."
Hamas has blamed Israel for Tuesday's explosion, and its health ministry says the blast killed at least 500 people. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, pushed back on the Israeli narrative in a video posted by The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets.
In it, Mansour appears to be speaking from the United Nations, surrounded by other Arab diplomats, and he says: “It is a lie. And they, the Israeli spokesperson of the army about a week ago made a statement in which he said evacuate the hospitals, the hospitals are target and in fact they hit one hospital a week ago. So their intentions is evacuate or hospitals will be hit. And they are responsible for that crime and they cannot fabricate stories to deal with it.”
Is there any kind of independent investigative team that can resolve the matter by cutting through the politics and examining the forensic evidence to find out who is responsible? The short answer is yes, but with some caveats.
"The essential point is that time is of the essence here for an accurate investigation of the site," said David Scheffer, an international law expert who served as the first U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues. "You would need a 'dream team' of forensic scientists skilled enough to look at the evidence on the ground and that which has been put forward by all sides, including Israel, the Biden administration and Hamas."
Scheffer told USA TODAY, given the superheated climate around Israel's intensifying war with Hamas, "how would you create the team quickly that would be acceptable to both sides so that it doesn't ignite political fires given its composition?"
Options might include the International Criminal Court, the U.N.-affiliated Commission of Inquiry, the International Commission of Jurists, and the Commission for International Justice and Accountability, but all have their challenges.

FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. – Desmond Ridder was the picture of NFL growing pains as he talked about turning the page on a disastrous ending last weekend while, well, looking ahead to a chance to make a claim on first place.
Ridder, the green Atlanta Falcons quarterback, is coming off the first three-interception game of his young NFL career. That left a lot of explaining for his media session before Wednesday’s practice.
"You try to obviously learn from the mistakes that were made … but you don’t dwell on those interceptions," said Ridder, whose next chance to make amends comes on Sunday at Tampa Bay (3-2) in a matchup that will determine the lead in the NFC South.
Survive long enough as an NFL quarterback and there will be weeks like this. Heat like this, with hot-take analysts suggesting the quarterback take a seat on the bench. The Falcons (3-3) lost an eight-point game against Washington after two of their final three drives ended with picks by the second-year quarterback. The other possession was rather ugly, too; the ball was turned over on downs that included a sack and two incompletions.
Talking turnovers, Ridder, 24, insisted there wasn’t a connecting thread. Was it accuracy or the play design? Bad decisions or bad routes?
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
"There were a couple things on each, where I could’ve made a better read, we could’ve ran a better route, or miscommunication," he said. "Or all three. So, there’s little parts in that entire game – not only with myself but with the whole offense. It’s got to be all 11 guys working on the same page."
In rolling with a young quarterback, the Falcons knew there would be some turbulence along the way with this learning curve. Ridder is surrounded by a strong cast of supporting weapons including first-round picks Bijan Robinson, Kyle Pitts and Drake London. And the defense has improved, allowing them to stay in games.
Yet as natural as it is for the quarterback to attract scrutiny, the crunch-time meltdown on Sunday – which included glaring clock management issues on top of the picks – wasn’t all on Ridder. Arthur Smith, the Falcons coach and play-caller, has fingerprints on this, too.
The Falcons’ operational process during the final minutes was a mess. On at least three occasions, the play-clock nearly ran out as Ridder prepared to call for the snaps. Atlanta probably uses as many personnel packages as any team in the league, which can help create matchup advantages but also requires frequent substitutions. And the unit uses an extensive amount of pre-snap motion, which can also chew up time.
In any event, this stuck out as the issues piled up on Sunday. During one sequence, the flow was so sloppy that after Ridder spiked the football to kill the clock, the Falcons still had to use a timeout as the 25-second play-clock was about to expire.
Asked about the operational issues, Smith fired back with arithmetic.
"Two-thousand plays the last two years," Smith said. "Things happen. They are all different. I wouldn’t call that some catastrophic trend. Now they shouldn’t happen. But they’re all different, why they happened. You identify the problem. But you take three plays out of 2,360…"
But still. It’s what happened lately. The mishaps on Sunday came with the game on the line.
"We can play this game all day," defended Smith, in his third season at the helm. "What about Houston? What about New York?"
In Week 5, the Falcons used a 10-play, 56-yard drive to beat the Texans 21-19 with a Younghoe Koo field goal as time expired. In Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, they executed a 12-play, 66-yard drive for Koo’s game-winning field goal with just under a minute on the clock. The New York game referenced was Smith’s first victory as Falcons coach, in Week 3 in 2021, when his team beat the Giants as then-quarterback Matt Ryan directed a seven-play, 56-yard drive that culminated with a Koo field goal as time expired.
"We’ve won a lot of games handling those situations," Smith added. "Obviously, we didn’t do it last week. We’ve got to get it fixed. This isn’t a trend, a runaway story. Acknowledge what happened. Fix it…Those things happened. That’s not the only reason we lost the game."
Smith pointed to the turnovers, maintaining that NFL teams this season have won just 6% of the games when committing three turnovers.
"Go back to Houston, and those guys executed pretty damn good," Smith said.
Ridder didn’t dispute the mishaps with the operational flow, which typically include the process of getting the play-call from the sideline in addition to the substitutions. Ryan, the previous quarterback, was sometimes frustrated with the process during his one season working with Smith. Now Ridder, while not pointing a finger at his coach, is dealing with similar issues.
He summed it up as a matter of paying better attention to detail, yet he also acknowledged the challenges with communication….especially as the play-clock winds down.
"It makes you speed things up faster," Ridder said. "That’s something we don’t want to do. It goes back to communication. Everybody knowing where they’re supposed to be…just the details with those plays."
Two of Ridder’s teammates, Pitts and London, commended their quarterback for keeping a calm demeanor amid the late-game chaos.
"He’s even-keeled," Pitts said. "When stuff is getting out of control, that’s not when you want to crumble. He’s good at keeping his composure."
Now Ridder – and the rest of his unit – will have to prove capable of growing from the hard lessons.
Editor's note: Part one of a five-part USA TODAY series revealing why America hasn't solved its long struggle with Type 2 diabetes.
For chef Robin Ray, newly married with young stepchildren, the turning point came when a stabbing chest pain sent her rushing to the emergency room. 
For Brian Castrucci, the gravity hit when the ER doc who had treated him for a near-heart attack a few weeks earlier gave him a big bear hug. “I didn’t think you’d make it,” the doctor said.
The crisis unspooled more slowly for James Haynes but started in 2019 when he stepped on a rusty nail and didn’t notice. 
The moments were turning points for all three to get serious about addressing their diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can’t properly regulate blood sugar, has become so common it’s almost considered inconsequential. More than 1 in 10 Americans have the disease (though many don't know) and another nearly 4 in 10 are at risk for it. In total, half of all adults and a quarter of teenagers have diabetes or pre-diabetes.
Its financial costs are astronomical. The country spends more than $300 billion a year to address diabetes, accounting for $1 out of every $4 spent on health care. 
And its personal tolls are even worse: heart attacks, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, double the risk of premature death. It also causes what’s known as “diabetes distress,” the daily burdens and emotional toll of living with and managing a chronic ailment that can lead to regular dips in energy, foggy thinking and depression, and a sense of isolation.
The most frustrating aspect of Type 2 diabetes, experts say, is that it has long been largely preventable and controllable. 
“We have made tremendous gains in understanding diabetes,” said Dr. Donald Berwick, a pediatrician and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “The best diabetes care can make a very big difference. You can’t say we don’t know what to do.”
And yet, diagnosed rates of Type 2 diabetes have soared over the past 25 years, and especially over the past dozen – particularly among working-age adults like Ray, Castrucci and Haynes. 
Roughly 40% of people who died early in the coronavirus pandemic had Type 2 diabetes, a rate four times higher than people without the disease. Even when elevated blood sugar levels are below the threshold for type 2 diabetes, the risk for heart disease jumps 30% to 50% compared with people with normal blood sugar levels. (Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 5% to 10% of diabetes, is caused by the immune system and is unrelated to diet or lifestyle.)
America’s failure to address Type 2 diabetes highlights larger problems with our food and medical systems, Berwick and other experts said.
A soda costs less than a bottle of water, a double cheeseburger and fries less than a carton of blueberries. Patients wait months for medical appointments only to see the back of a white coat for the short time they’re allotted. Treating disease costs society far more than preventing it but typically provides more profit for insurance companies, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry.
The USA TODAY Health team spoke with scores of health care providers, researchers, community leaders and patients for this five-part series to understand why Type 2 diabetes continues to worsen in America despite known solutions.
The answer isn't simple. It involves systemic problems facing everyone in society, not just those with diabetes: a food system designed to sell products; a medical system in which cutting off a leg is less expensive than saving it; the high cost of healthy living and the fact that breaking habits takes a lot more than just personal willpower.
This first story looks at what it takes for people to cope with or overcome the disease.
Then, we explore one community in a David vs. Goliath battle against a food system that fails to prioritize people's health.

The system is fixable, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.
But it will take "sensible action" from across many sectors, including health care, science, nutrition, business, public health and politics to change the financial and other incentives that drive so many Americans toward sickness instead of health.
"If we do it all, we could fix a lot of this in 10 years," said Mozaffarian, who serves on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. "If we do it incrementally or don't do it at all, we're all going to be toast in 50 years from diet-related illnesses and a depleted environment."
There’s no question personal responsibility plays a role in fighting diabetes. 
Haynes, Ray and Castrucci radically changed their lifestyles and sought help after their come-to-Jesus experiences. They’ve reduced their dependence on daily medication and hope to have saved themselves the horrors of more amputations, blindness and dialysis. They’ve extended their lives and improved the quality of that time.
But like many medical problems, the challenges of diabetes go well beyond individual responsibility and blame. 
“There are structural issues that we have to start paying attention to and addressing,” said Dr. Shivani Agarwal, an endocrinologist who specializes in research and treating young adults with diabetes at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Agarwal recently led a series of studies in the journal The Lancet that looked at diabetes rates around the world. 
Poverty, the studies showed, was a major driver of diabetes, along with racism and unequal access to healthy food and high-quality medical care.
Personal stories illustrate how these structural issues play out in the lives of so many Americans.
Ray, 45, director of culinary operations at HOSCO/North Sarah Food Hub in St. Louis, got weight-loss surgery and then put her culinary expertise to good use.  
Castrucci, 49, who runs a public health nonprofit outside Washington, D.C., used his advantages provided by his work, salary and insurance to “buy” himself better health.
 “I’m healthy because of privilege – not diet, not exercise, not determination,” he said.
Haynes, 58, a former truck driver and maintenance technician in Gulfport, Mississippi, has fewer material assets, but his attitude and the advantages he does have explain why he's still around, despite all he has been through.
“It’s going to be all right after a while, as long as I keep this spirit,” he said.
Ray’s love for food began when she was 8 years old, watching Julia Child on TV. During family gatherings, she would run around taking everyone’s dinner order. Then she’d scurry back to the kitchen with a notepad full of scribbles. 
Throughout her life, she made fried chicken, pork chops, baked mac and cheese, collard greens, and even a whole roasted chicken filled with wild rice and two sticks of butter – everything that made her soul sing. 
In her world, food was home. Food was family. Food was love. 
But that was some pretty tough love. 
In 2002, Ray was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Her father, grandmother, aunts and uncles all had diabetes. She knew what it meant.
“For you to tell me I can’t have ice blue raspberry Kool-Aid was like you shut down my world,” Ray said. “I didn’t want to accept it. So, I ate, because you eat through your emotions.” 
She didn't dwell on the diagnosis and continued with life. Her culinary career took her to Italy, where she learned and fell even more in love with food. She returned to St. Louis, got married and became a mom to her husband’s two children ‒ “beautiful bonus babies,” as she described them. Through the years, she continued to express love through cooking and eating. 
In 2015, a stabbing chest pain sent her to the emergency room. Doctors assured Ray she hadn’t had a heart attack, but they warned that her life was on the line. At 5-foot-2, she weighed 334 pounds and had an A1C, a measure of average blood sugar of 11%, well above the 6.5% cutoff to be considered diabetic. Her diabetes – and her diet – were out of control. 
“That scared me. … It was gut-wrenching and terrifying,” she said. “I’m fighting against something that’s fighting me back and I did not know how to win.” 
She and her primary care doctor decided she would pursue weight loss surgery. 
But she also decided to use her culinary prowess to transform her diet. She reconfigured favorite foods, substituting healthier ingredients: Collard greens cooked in smoked fats or ham hocks turned into a kale, turnip and rutabaga recipe flavored with natural chicken broth fat, oils and seasonings. 
She fostered her feelings into new recipes and brought them to North Sarah Food Hub, which partnered with Barnes-Jewish Hospital to make packaged, pre-made meals for St. Louis residents with diabetes and limited access to fresh food.
“I had to restructure the food that I put in my mouth. I had to think about what I was eating and how I was eating and how it was going to be good for my body,” she said. “I became excited about food again, and food became a joy.” 
It isn’t always easy, of course. Ray admits to an occasional cookie craving. But now she takes the time to think about how her body processes that cookie and whether it’s worthwhile. 
She hopes her cooking can help other people make the same transformation she did. Her staff at North Sarah helps her create new recipes for others. She wants to provide nourishment that allows people to avoid illness and medicine. 
“Nobody wants to take 55 pills, nobody wants to feel like a patient, but how do you fix that? It’s by our food,” she said. “That should be what we’re teaching our community and our culture and our children. … It’s not always about the macaroni noodle with a smile, it’s about what’s good for your body.” 
Castrucci is a third-generation diabetes patient. The lifetime risk of developing Type 2 diabetes if a parent has it is 40%. If both parents have it, the risk jumps to 70%.
He knew he was at risk, but he pushed his luck, he said, by eating poorly during the pandemic and falling out of his exercise routine. With the luxury of working from home, walking to the kitchen and bathroom was often the extent of his daily activity.
On Feb. 14, 2022 – Valentine’s Day – he went to an urgent care clinic, concerned his breathing trouble meant he had bronchitis. His blood pressure measured 210 over 110, well above normal levels that top out at 120 over 80. A chest X-ray showed fluid filling his lungs, leading to congestive heart failure. 
The clinic sent him straight to a local emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a blockage of the left descending artery – a clogged artery made worse by diabetes. If he had waited any longer, he would have had a massive heart attack, his doctor later told him.
After his release from the hospital, he went to the drugstore to fill his new prescriptions. The pharmacist told him she couldn’t fill one because it would cost $1,000. He’d have to wait until his insurance approved it. “Please fill it,” he said. She stressed the cost. “Fill it,” he pleaded, putting the charge on his credit card.
Medication helped him lose 70 pounds in three months. When his local drugstore ran out of the weight-loss drug, he easily drove to another pharmacy and then another to find what he needed. 
His 100 hours of high-quality cardiac rehabilitation were fully covered by insurance.  
"For my midlife crisis, I got healthy," Castrucci said.
He could devote all his energy to getting well because he didn’t have to focus on how to afford his care. “(I) paid almost nothing for the whole episode,” he said, “and never worried about it because I have really good insurance.” 
Even so, Castrucci pays out-of-pocket for a cardiologist and an endocrinologist because the best ones near him don’t accept insurance.
Every time he goes to Walgreens to refill his medications, Castrucci said, he sees someone turned away because they can’t afford their prescriptions. When they finally show up in the emergency room, “because they will,” they will cost the system far more, he said.
“Health outcomes are dictated by economics. It’s a whole side of privilege that we don’t always talk about.”
On the day Haynes stepped on a rusty nail in 2019, he walked all day as the nail pierced the sole of his sneaker and then his foot. By the time he took off his shoe that night, his foot was infected. He landed in the hospital for two months as doctors and nurses tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to get the infection and Haynes’ blood sugar under control.
By the time he was released, he knew enough about Type 2 diabetes to realize his daily blood sugar levels – typically in the mid-400s – were four times above what he had been told to shoot for.
But nothing he did or ate seemed to make a difference. He had long since traded ribs for salads, beer for water. 
His wife, Angela, barely noticed when James started wearing multiple pairs of socks, pouring powder on his feet and buying bigger shoes. His feet tingled a lot, he said, but he was coping with it. 
James ended up in the emergency room again, dehydrated and in need of antibiotics. The doctor amputated the baby toe on his right foot, leaving a large open wound. 
"We're going to leave this open because we'll probably have to take more,” Angela remembered the doctor saying. “I didn't like that we're not going to try to save anything, we're just going to start cutting.”
James was fading.
His arm muscles shriveled and he lost his Popeye physique. Antibiotics left him looking sickly, his voice so weak Angela could barely hear him. “I felt like I was watching my husband slowly dying,” she said.
Finally, taking her doctor sister’s advice, Angela emailed Dr. Foluso Fakorede’s office to ask for an appointment. She thought it would take months to get James in to see the heart disease specialist, but the office called and asked if they could come the next day. 
The Hayneses would end up going back to see Fakorede many times − sometimes twice in one week, driving more than five hours each way from Gulfport north to Cleveland, Mississippi.
“We started looking forward to these visits because there was always hope,” Angela Haynes said, though she felt guilty they were taking up so much of the important doctor’s time. 
Fakorede, who is on a personal mission to save people with diabetes from amputations, noticed what other doctors had missed. Haynes had blockages in blood vessels on both legs. 
Once he got the blood flowing again, Haynes began to feel better. His flesh returned to its normal color. The wound started healing at last. Walking became easier.
Then disaster struck again. 
On July 2, 2022, Haynes caught COVID-19. "Everything went downhill after that," he said.
During his 13-day illness, the bacteria in his foot raged out of control. He ended up back in the hospital and unable to withstand the long drive to Fakorede’s office.
Every week, a surgeon would come to the door of his hospital room and before even stepping all the way in ask Haynes whether he had decided to get his leg amputated. 
"This is my leg. I was born with this. And you're walking in like you're cutting a piece of cake," Haynes said.
He was worried about how he’d get around, how he’d be able to work to support his family if he had only one leg. No one took the time to explain why they thought the leg needed to come off or how he’d cope without it, Haynes said. 
In late November, he was finally sent home in a wheelchair. But just three weeks later, as he was getting out of the car after wound care, his right leg gave out and he fell to the ground. Back at the hospital, Haynes was told his foot was broken, essentially beyond repair. He agreed to a below-the-knee amputation.
Released right before Christmas, he spent the next three weeks in bed wondering how he’d manage the rest of his life.
Finally, it looked as if his luck might be turning around.
With the leg gone, his diabetes improved. His blood sugar dropped into the 120s or one-teens. His blurry vision cleared up.
During his long hospital stay, he befriended nurses and learned about a program for people who needed prostheses. The man who ran it called early in the year and said he had received a donated leg. If it fit Haynes, he could have it while waiting for insurance to pay for a personalized one. Miraculously, it did. 
Haynes spent the next six months teaching himself to walk again. The donor leg was heavy and uncomfortable. He wasn't mobile enough to hold down a job.
One late spring night, picking up dinner at a nearby restaurant, he headed to the bathroom for a pit stop. A sink had been leaking all day and Haynes slipped in the puddle, falling backward.
He's still recovering from the resulting wrist surgery.
He and Angela are living – barely – off her part-time salary as a secretary and a church organist.
Haynes has tried "at least three or four times" to receive government assistance, but they keep losing his paperwork, or not believing he's disabled, though he once checked himself out of the hospital and arrived at an appointment in his wheelchair to prove he didn't have a leg.
Still, he clings to his faith and the positive attitude he has long used to cheer up himself and others. These are his secret weapons against diabetes and everything else life throws his way.
"I try to put a smile on other people's faces," he said. "It keeps my day going."

The USA TODAY Best-selling Booklist is back!
After a brief hiatus, USA TODAY’s beloved bestsellers list has returned with the features and characteristics that have long made it the People’s Booklist.
Our goal remains the same: Provide book lovers with the best, most accurate snapshot of what people are reading by showing which titles are selling. It is a master list, unbound by genre and format, of what’s selling broadly across the U.S.
“I am so thrilled that the USA Today Best-selling Booklist is coming back!" says bestselling author Colleen Hoover in a statement. "It gives so many authors the wonderful opportunity to be recognized as bestsellers and for readers to discover their next favorite book.”
Hoover, the self-published writer turned bestselling powerhouse who's authored dozens of novels including "It Ends With Us" and "Verity," was the undisputed queen of the Booklist in 2022 and spent weeks atop the list. Her novel "It Starts With Us" claimed the No. 1 spot in its first week, her highest debut ever, selling more than 800,000 copies on its first day of sales. It was her fourth book to hit No. 1 in 2022.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
The USA TODAY list is a ranking of the top-selling titles each week from a broad range of businesses including major chains, independent bookstores and online retailers. It reflects combined sales of titles in print and electronic format, if available. Our data team weighs and compiles those numbers to generate the week's 150 top-selling titles. The rankings reflect sales from the previous Monday through Sunday. The full list will publish online at 6 a.m. Wednesdays, with the top 50 titles publishing in print Thursdays.
The list, which began in 1993, went on hiatus in December. It is the longest-running USA TODAY data journalism project.
In our continued commitment to bring readers more books coverage, USA TODAY is also excited to announce a new content partnership with The Novel Neighbor, an independently owned and operated bookstore in St. Louis. They are expert booksellers and passionate readers who are deeply connected to what their community is reading. With the partnership will come regular profiles of independent bookstores across the country, highlighting the important role of these businesses in their local communities. Novel Neighbor will also be sharing expert book recommendations and fun takes on book trends.
We can't wait to see what you've been reading!
U.S. household wealth ballooned at a record pace during the pandemic as the government doled out unprecedented aid, Americans hunkered down amid widespread lockdowns and stock and home values soared, according to a Federal Reserve survey.
From 2019 to 2022, the median net worth of U.S. families surged 37% to $192,900, adjusted for inflation – the largest rise in the history of the Fed's Survey of Consumer Finances, which is conducted every three years.
Median income, meanwhile, grew a relatively modest 3%, and debt was fairly stable, the Fed said in the report.
During the pandemic, many households received financial windfalls from the government in an effort to tide families over amid widespread business shutdowns and 22 million layoffs. That included three rounds of stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits and a pause in student loan repayments.
From 2019 to 2022, the share of families owning stocks increased from 15% to 21%, the largest on record. Median stock holdings fell to $15,000 from $29,000, but that’s because new stock owners held smaller portfolios than longstanding stockholders.
The share of families owning homes rose to 66.1% from 64.9%, and the median home value increased 24% to $323,200. During the pandemic, millions of Americans left cities and bought homes in suburbs or rural areas, often purchasing larger houses to accommodate the increased time they spent at home and their remote work set-ups.
The large wealth gains during the pandemic likely have been pared back since last year, a trend that wasn't captured in the survey. Stock prices have declined as the Fed has raised interest rates sharply to fight inflation and home values have fallen in many regions amid soaring mortgage rates.
During the pandemic, however, the gains were substantial and broad-based, lifting all racial, income, age and education and other groups. Families that didn’t finish high school notched the largest median gain in net worth at 60%. The net worth of Black families also rose 60%, the largest among racial groups, but their median wealth totaled $44,900 in 2022, still far below $285,000 for white people.
The bottom one-fourth of households by wealth experienced the largest jump, with their median net worth rising to $3,500 from $400. The pace of the increase was progressively smaller for richer households with the top tenth posting a 26% rise to $3.8 million. However, that still amounted to the biggest increase in dollar terms.
Among income groups, the wealth gain was largest (69%) for the top 80% to 90% of income earners and smallest (24%) for those in the bottom one-fifth.
Meanwhile, from 2018 to 2021, median income rose a relatively modest 3% to $70,300. The gain captured government assistance such as enhanced unemployment and food stamp benefits but not stimulus payments, the Fed said.
A hefty 28% of families said their income was unusual in 2021, “reflecting the large imprint that COVID-19 and myriad pandemic-related policies left on the U.S. economy.” More families, however, reported lower-than-usual than higher-than-usual income, underscoring the pain inflicted by layoffs and a decline in working hours during the depths of the crisis.
Median income gains were concentrated among families with a college degree. For those without a high school diploma, income fell 10%. Income inequality widened as the bottom fifth of earners saw median income rise 5% while the top tenth notched a 15% gain.
Among racial groups, white families had the largest income gain at 16%. Black and Hispanic families posted slight decreases.
As Americans moved to more sparsely populated areas to escape the pandemic, the income gap between those living in cities and rural areas narrowed. Median income surged 14% for families outside metro areas, compared to 4% for those in metro areas.
Median net worth similarly increased more sharply for residents outside metro areas.
U.S. Capitol Police said Thursday that they arrested more than 300 protesters who held a demonstration inside a U.S. House office building in Washington D.C., over the Israel-Hamas war.
Protesters with Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow were detained on Capitol Hill while calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, a narrow strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.
Police reported that the protest broke out at the Cannon House Office Building just before 1:40 p.m. Wednesday and shut down roads outside the building due to the demonstration.
Video shows demonstrators wearing black T-shirts reading "Jews Say Ceasefire Now" in white lettering shouting "Ceasefire now!" Other footage shows the group sitting on the Cannon Rotunda floor clapping in unison.
U.S. House and Senate office buildings are open to the public but protests are forbidden in congressional buildings.
Gaza hospital explosion:How a deadly blast near al-Ahli center unfolded
Arrests took place in the Cannon Rotunda, police reported.
U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Paul Starks told USA TODAY on Thursday that police arrested 308 people on charges of crowding, obstructing, or incommoding in a forbidden area. They were ticketed and released.
Of those arrested, three people were also charged with assault of a police officer because, Starks said, they resisted arrest.
Starks said police were not aware of any major injuries.
The rotunda was cleared by 5 p.m., police said.
The war:As war in Israel, Gaza rages on, President Biden is having a moment
On Oct. 7, a major Jewish holiday, Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns. The attack, which killed hundreds of civilians, stunned Israel and caught its military and intelligence apparatus completely off guard.
Israel immediately launched airstrikes on Gaza, destroying entire neighborhoods and killing hundreds of Palestinian civilians in the days that have followed.
As of Thursday, the war's death toll surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides. At least 199 people, including children, were captured by Hamas and taken into Gaza, according to Israel.
The leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, said in a recorded message that the assault was in response to Israel's 16-year blockade of Gaza; Israeli raids inside West Bank cities over the past year, violence at at the Al-Aqsa Mosque − built on a contested Jerusalem holy site sacred to Jews as the Temple Mount; increased attacks by settlers on Palestinians; and the expansion of Jewish settlements on occupied lands Palestinians claim for a future state.
The Hamas incursion came on Simchat Torah, a normally joyous day when Jews complete the annual cycle of reading the Torah scroll. Israel declared war the next day.
Previous Israel-Hamas wars were in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021.

Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson, and this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday the 19th of October 2023. Today, a look at what an independent investigation into the Gaza hospital strike could look like. Plus the suspect and the disappearance of Natalee Holloway has confessed to her murder. And the House is still frozen without a speaker.
♦
President Joe Biden has secured an agreement with Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. That's as he returns home following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in the wake of a strike on a hospital in Gaza City that killed hundreds of people. Protests have erupted across the Middle East after the blast, with thousands taking to the streets in many Arab countries to condemn Israel's airstrikes on Gaza. Many questions remain about the strike on the hospital, including who's at fault. I spoke with USA Today Domestic Security Correspondent Josh Meyer about whether an independent investigation could help bring answers. Josh, thanks for making the time.
Josh Meyer:
My pleasure, Taylor.
Taylor Wilson:
So just starting here, Josh, what exactly happened in this Gaza hospital strike? What do we know as of now?
Josh Meyer:
Well, that's a good question. We don't really know. We know that a missile or some kind of ordinance landed on the hospital or at the hospital parking lot, killed several hundred people that were either injured and at the hospital or people seeking shelter there. But Israel is saying that it was an errant rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is another militant group in the Palestinian territories, along with Hamas. Hamas and the Palestinians are saying that Israel did it and said that they did it on purpose, and that they had been warning people to evacuate hospitals and that this was part of that effort. So the problem is both sides insist they're right. Israel offered a lot more forensic evidence to back up its assessment that it was not responsible for the missile strike, including intercepts and public source information and satellite imagery, suggesting that the rocket was fired northbound from south in the Gaza Strip. But this may be one of those circumstances where you need some kind of independent investigation to determine really what happened in a way that people believe.
Taylor Wilson:
And Josh, what types of independent investigative teams could find out who's responsible here?
Josh Meyer:
So I talked to David Scheffer, who's an independent law expert who served as the first US ambassador at large for war crimes. And this is exactly what it would be if it was an intentional strike, it would be a war crime. And he said that you need a dream team of forensic scientists skilled enough to look at the evidence on the ground and also that evidence that's been put forward by all sides, including Hamas, Israel and the Biden administration. The problem is they need to be on the ground almost right away because the evidence will dissipate. It's something that's not going to stay very long. One option is the International Criminal Court. Another option is the United Nations Affiliated Commission of Inquiry. A third one is the International Commission of Jurists, which is based in Geneva, Switzerland. And then there's also a Commission for International Justice and Accountability.
Taylor Wilson:
Josh, what are some of the unique challenges to an independent probe in Israel and Gaza amid all of this violence?
Josh Meyer:
Well, it's going to be tricky, especially, Taylor, because of the politics involved. It's one of those things where almost anybody Israel recommends to be on the investigative team might be rejected by the Palestinians. Anybody Palestine, the Gaza authorities or Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad recommends would be vetoed by Israel. So the question is getting people that are expert enough to really get ahold of all of the evidence and assess what happened but also get a team together that's going to be allowed into the hospital area to investigate this and also that's going to be accepted by Israel and Hamas and the authorities in Gaza. So one thing to remember is that the International Criminal Court one might think is the best option here because they have jurisdiction over the Palestinian territories, including Gaza, according to Scheffer, the war crimes expert I talked to. But Israel would likely contest that too because Israel is not a party to the ICC, nor is the United States.
And actually, in 2021, when the top ICC prosecutor confirmed the opening of an investigation into potential atrocities committed in the territories, Anthony Blinken, who was the Secretary of State at the time and still is, said that the US government firmly opposes that decision too. Basically the Biden administration said that the ICC has no jurisdiction over the matter, in part because Israel is not a party to the ICC, but he also said that the Palestinian territories were not technically covered by the International Criminal Court. So again, it's very politicized and it's going to be tough to find any neutral body that exists or that could be created to really look into this.
Taylor Wilson:
And President Joe Biden has been visiting Israel this week. We know he's said to give an address tonight about this hospital strike and there have also been mass protests surrounding this hospital attack and the conflicting answers after it. Do we have any sense of what to expect from Biden's remarks on this?
Josh Meyer:
Yeah, I mean, I think the sense we're getting is that Biden's going to talk about two things. One, he's going to try to lower the temperature. It's become so politicized. You're seeing protests and threats and anger across the United States and across the world, so he's going to be trying to sort of talk to people and hope that level heads prevail. But I think he's also going to talk about US funding for Israel and providing the Israeli government with whatever money they need to protect Israeli citizens. And I think that we may expect that he will also provide some money for the Palestinian Territories, for the people there too. The conditions that they're living in right now, especially with Israel's mounting response to the October 7th attacks, which were horrific. But the Palestinians, according to reports, are living without food, easy access to water. There's a lot of sickness going on and so forth.
Taylor Wilson:
Josh Meyer, thank you so much for your insight on all of this. Appreciate it.
Josh Meyer:
As always, my pleasure. Thanks, Taylor.

The main suspect in the unsolved disappearance of Natalee Holloway has confessed to killing her. Court documents show that Joran Van Der Sloot has confessed to killing the teenager in 2005 and disposing of her remains before trying to extort her grieving family. Federal prosecutors accused him in a 2010 indictment of hatching a plot to sell information about the location of Holloway's remains to her grieving family in exchange for $250,000. They Van Der Sloot had already been serving a 28-year prison sentence in South America for the murder of a Peruvian businesswoman in 2010. He was extradited to the US in June to stand trial in the extortion case.
He was sentenced to 20 years in prison this week, but as part of his plea agreement, that sentence will run concurrently with his sentence in Peru on the murder case. As a condition of the plea deal, he agreed to reveal how Holloway died and how her body was disposed of according to a federal sentencing memorandum. Holloway was 18 when she vanished during a trip to Aruba with high school classmates. Van Der Sloot cannot be charged in the US for the suspected murder itself, even with a confession. But Natalee's mother, Beth, said that the knowledge gave her a sense of peace.

Republican lawmakers again failed to elect a new speaker of the House yesterday after Congressman Jim Jordan lost his second vote for the position. I caught up with USA Today Congress Campaigns and Democracy reporter Ken Tran for the latest. Ken, good to have you back on.
Ken Tran:
Thanks for having me.
Taylor Wilson:
Ken, what exactly happened here?
Ken Tran:
Congressman Jordan, Chair of the [inaudible 00:08:06] for House Judiciary Committee, faced a first ballot on Tuesday at noon. Here, he'd lost the first ballot, similar to former speaker Kevin McCarthy, who went through multiple rounds of voting. Jordan lost that first ballot by 20 defections. 20 GOP lawmakers were against the speakership. So on Wednesday at 11:00, he saw a second vote and he actually saw support fall. 22 GOP lawmakers voted against him, which is an indication that his support is falling and his speakership is in danger right now, or his prospective speakership.
Taylor Wilson:
And Ken, who are the main holdouts at this point preventing Congressman Jordan from winning the vote? What part of the party are we talking about here?
Ken Tran:
They span across a broad spectrum of the Republican Party but most of them are considered the more moderate Republicans who are namely upset with how the process has played out, especially the ousting of former speaker Kevin McCarthy. These moderate Republicans, such as Congressman Don Bacon from Nebraska, he represents a Biden won district. Congressman Steve Womack from Arkansas, he's a Senior Appropriator. Also Congresswoman Kay Granger from Florida, she's chair of the very powerful House Appropriations Committee. So these lawmakers are, one, against Jim Jordan, partly because of his more conservative credentials, but also because Jordan and his allies inadvertently have started a pressure campaign on these lawmakers to vote for Jordan and making them more entrenched in their views and opposition against him.
Taylor Wilson:
And who's Jordan's biggest challenger for the position at this point?
Ken Tran:
That's the problem we're facing right now is that there is no clear challenger. His opponents are saying that Jordan will never be able to get the 217 votes necessary to become speaker. At the same time, it's very unclear who else in the Republican Party can do that. The most viable alternative talks right now is empowering the current acting speaker, speaker pro tempore Congressman Patrick McHenry, Republican from North Carolina, and giving him temporary powers to oversee more time-sensitive issues, such as funding the government by a mid-November deadline or passing a foreign aid package for Israel.
Taylor Wilson:
And Ken, what's happening at the house right now? Is it completely shut down from legislative action while this happens?
Ken Tran:
House committees can continue doing their work, but otherwise, any legislation cannot go to the floor. The House can only hold speaker elections. But also the thing with Patrick McHenry is that we've never been in this situation before. So anything that Patrick McHenry does as speaker pro tempore would set the precedent for anyone else in his position in the future. However, McHenry has been resistant to the idea of being empowered. He's laser focused right now, he says, on electing Jim Jordan to speaker. So as far as we've seen, he's only overseen speaker elections.
Taylor Wilson:
All right. There's a lot of hurry up and wait right now, Ken, what happens next here?
Ken Tran:
So Jordan will face a third vote at noon today, but we, again, don't know how many votes he's going to lose. He's expected to also lose this vote, and it's also possible he loses more support. If that does happen, we could see more GOP lawmakers start to urge him to drop out. He's indicated that he's going to stick in this for as long as it takes maybe. He's shown confidence that he will be elected speaker at some point. We just don't know when. So really just more waiting and seeing.
Taylor Wilson:
All right. Ken Tran, thank you as always for making time for us on another busy week. Thanks, Ken.
Ken Tran:
Thanks for having me.

Today is LGBTQ Center Awareness Day, a time to recognize the crucial resources offered by these kinds of community centers around the country and the world. But some are disappearing on US college campuses. And as it stands, there are only 250 professionally run LGBTQ centers on campuses across the country today, according to the Post-Secondary National Policy Institute. That makes up just a fraction of the nearly 4,000 colleges and universities in the US, all while a fifth of college students surveyed in 2020 by the Associated Press said they identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, queer, or questioning. And there are concerns from some that new bills in Texas and Florida aimed at banning offices dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, could cut these centers even further. Research shows that LGBTQ college students face persistent barriers to getting into college and staying there. And advocates say the safe spaces afforded by these centers can make a big difference. You can read more with a link in today's show notes.

The Las Vegas Aces are WNBA basketball Champions again. They won their second championship in a row last night, taking down the New York Liberty. Coach Becky Hammond, before the series, told her team, "This team over here was put together to take you out." That was a reference to the Frenzied Free Agency last year in women's basketball, where several teams attempted to gobble up some of the biggest stars and make super teams, while the Aces relied on their continuity from the previous season. They're now the WNBA's first back-to-back champion since the Los Angeles Sparks won it all back in 2001 and 2002.

No place was safe for more than 2 million Palestinians on Thursday as Israeli bombs slammed across the Gaza Strip, including parts of the Palestinian territory that Israel had declared "safe zones."
At least 12 people were killed and dozens wounded Thursday when a residential building in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis was struck, medical personnel at Nasser Hospital said. The intensified shelling came one day after Israel agreed to allow limited shipments of humanitarian aid into southern Gaza from Egypt.
"Israeli Air Forces continued to strike southern areas despite the directive for people in #Gaza to move south," the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) tweeted. The agency said at least 14 of its own staff had been killed and nine more wounded − adding that the "actual number is likely to be much higher" − in less than two weeks since a stunning, bloody incursion of Hamas militants killed more than 1,000 Israeli citizens and fueled military reprisals from Israel.
The commander of the Hamas-led National Security Forces, Maj. Gen. Jihad Muheisen, was killed in an Israeli strike on his Gaza City home along with some relatives, Hamas said. Israel Defense Forces says it is attacking Hamas militants wherever they hide in Gaza and has accused the militants of taking shelter among the civilian population.
The death toll of Israelis and Palestinians surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five wars involving the narrow, densely populated strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.

Developments:
∎ More than 100 retired U.S. generals have signed an open letter from the Washinton-based Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs calling on President Biden and Congress to give Israel all the support it needs militarily, diplomatically and logistically against the "Iran-backed terrorist threats that surround it on all sides."
∎Hamas’ spokesman Wael Abu Omar said no aid trucks or road repair equipment had entered Gaza from the Egypt border crossing as of Thursday afternoon. The aid deal struck Wednesday had included a stipulation that roads essential to the flow of aid would first be repaired.
∎Hamas fighters likely fired North Korean weapons during their Oct. 7 assault on Israel, a militant video and weapons seized by Israel show, despite Pyongyang’s denials that it arms the militant group. South Korean officials, two experts on North Korean arms and an Associated Press analysis of weapons captured on the battlefield by Israel point toward Hamas using Pyongyang’s F-7 rocket-propelled grenade, a shoulder-fired weapon that fighters typically use against armored vehicles.
∎ The death toll in Gaza climbed to at least 3,785 people Thursday, the Gaza Health Ministry said. Over 1,500 children and 1,000 women were among those killed; at least 12,493 people have been injured, the ministry said. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, mostly civilians slain during Hamas’ bloody incursion on Oct. 7.
∎Israeli authorities said Thursday they had notified the families of 203 people believed held by Hamas militants. The number of known hostages has crept higher almost daily.
A U.S. cargo plane arrived in Israel carrying the initial shipment of armored vehicles designated to replace vehicles damaged during the war, the Israel Ministry of Defense said Thursday. Armored ambulances, trucks, and mechanical engineering equipment are expected to arrive in coming days, the ministry said. The first delivery came the day after President Joe Biden's historic trip to Tel Aviv, where he pledged the U.S. would stand by Israel and provide whatever is needed for it to defend itself in its war with Hamas. Biden also said he would seek congressional approval of an "unprecedented support package" to bolster Israel's defense.
Biden also pledged $100 million in U.S. funding for humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
As war in Israel, Gaza rages onAs war in Israel, Gaza rages on, President Biden is having a moment
More than a million people have fled their homes in the Gaza Strip ahead of an expected Israel invasion that seeks to eliminate Hamas’ leadership after its deadly incursion. Aid groups warn an Israeli ground offensive could hasten a humanitarian crisis. About 300,000 Israelis have been internally displaced since the start of the war, the Times of Israel reports, citing Israel Democracy Institute research. Most are from southern Israel in the Gaza border towns where Hamas carried out its murderous rampage.
President Joe Biden has made a sudden transformation from a political figure whose commitment to Israel was often questioned by conservative critics inside and outside the Jewish state to arguably the world's leading champion of Israel outside the Middle East. Biden's actions and words since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, capped by a dramatic visit to Israel on Wednesday, have been lauded even by many of Biden's biggest skeptics in Israel as he stands in solidarity with Israel and pledges "unprecedented" military assistance.
"Israelis were hungry for a father figure that will hug them and show empathy. And the president has done that in such a way that really touched every Israeli," said Nimrod Novik, a former foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and now a fellow with the Israel Policy Forum.

Gaza hospital explosion:How a deadly blast near al-Ahli center unfolded
Palestinian Americans are seeing two fronts in the Israel-Hamas war: one is the bloodshed in the Middle East. The other is emotional backlash from bigotry and hate in the U.S. A U.S. Department of Justice hate crime investigation into the fatal stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American Muslim boy in Illinois is one of several incidents of alleged hate being directed at Palestinian Americans, allies and people who look like them since the war began.
The community feels under siege, American Muslims for Palestine executive director Osama Abu Irshaid told USA TODAY. But at the same time, wants to show support and express grief in the war crisis.
“They’re not out there to threaten anyone," Irshaid said. "They’re not there to delegitimize another narrative. They’re out there to assert a narrative that is being diminished."

Battle against hate:Violence, bigotry toward Palestinian Americans spiking across U.S.
The Israel Defense Forces, also known as the IDF, is the national military of Israel. It has three branches: the army, navy and air force. It is a conscripted military service, meaning Israel mandates IDF service for Jewish, Druze and Circassian citizens over the age of 18, with some exceptions. It was established in 1948, two weeks after Israel became an independent country.
Before the war began, the IDF had 169,500 active troops and was the 28th largest military in the world by active personnel, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military Balance 2023. There were also 465,000 reserve personnel to supplement active military forces if deemed necessary.

More:Biden: Gaza to get aid by Friday; US says Israel not to blame for hospital blast. Live updates
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, and several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for the establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material, and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.

WASHINGTON — About 15 minutes into President Joe Biden's Zoom call last Friday with families of Americans taken hostage by Hamas, a White House aide started to end the session.
But Biden wouldn't have it, according to one of the family members on the call.
"The president actually looked at him and said: 'Last time I checked I'm the president of the United States. And this meeting will end when I say it ends,'" said Ruby Chen of Israel, the father of Itay Chen, a 19-year-old member of the Israel Defense Forces and a dual US-Israeli citizen who is among those missing. "He actually wanted to hear from every single one of us."
The moment encapsulated Biden's sudden transformation from a political figure whose commitment to Israel was often questioned by conservative critics inside and outside the Jewish state to – right now – arguably the world's leading champion of Israel outside the Middle East.
Biden's actions and words since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, capped by a dramatic visit Wednesday to Israel, have been lauded even by many of Biden's biggest skeptics in Israel as he stands in solidarity with Israel and pledges "unprecedented" military assistance.
"Israelis were hungry for a father figure that will hug them and show empathy. And the president has done that in such a way that really touched every Israeli," said Nimrod Novik, a former foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and now a fellow with the Israel Policy Forum.
Israelis last week displayed a billboard off a highway in Tel Aviv stating, "Thank you, Mr. President," next to Biden's image. A billboard welcomed Biden to Israel during his visit Wednesday.
The praise showering Biden in Israel comes as its own leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has seen his support in his country plummet in the wake of the Hamas attack and Israel's military response.
A poll from the firm, Maariv, Lazar Research, reported by Haaretz, found more than two-thirds of Israeli's prefer "someone else" than Netanyahu to serve as prime minister after the war. Benny Gantz, leader of Israel's National Unity Party, has seen his party's support soar since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.
"Absolutely, President Biden is the much more popular leader in Israel than Bibi Netanyahu," said Richard Stengel, a former under secretary of state in the Obama administration, in an interview on MSNBC.
Israeli support for Biden extends to his efforts to return home Americans who, like Itay Chen, make up some of an estimated 200 to 250 people believed to be held hostage by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.
Although polling on Biden's popularity in Israel since the attack isn't public, a whopping 48% of Israelis watched Biden's White House address last week when he condemned the attack as "pure, unadulterated evil" and committed U.S. military aid to Israel.
"It was quite remarkable how well that was received in Israel, including by people on the right wing who were not predisposed to like Biden," said Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. "It really resonated in Israel in a rather unique way, especially given the leadership vacuum in Israel right now."
During his whirlwind stop in Israel on Wednesday, Biden met with Netanyahu, family members of hostages and compared the atrocities of the Hamas attack, which killed more than 1,300 Israelis, to the brutality of the Holocaust.
"The world watched then and knew, and the world did nothing," Biden said in a speech from Tel Aviv with American and Israeli flags behind him. "We will not stand by and do nothing again. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever."
Biden cautioned Israelis "don’t be consumed" by the rage they feel today, warning about "mistakes" the U.S. after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Yet his backing of Israel was unmistakable.
"I'm here to tell you that terrorists will not win. Freedom will win," Biden concluded. "Israel will be a safe, secure Jewish and democratic state today, tomorrow and forever."
Biden, upon landing in Air Force One in Israel, greeted Netanyahu with a big hug.
The Israeli prime minister has faced criticism in Israel for the security failure that allowed the Hamas massacre to unfold. Netanyahu met Sunday for the first time with family members of kidnapped Israelis amid criticism that he's not done enough to save them.
“Your visit is the first here by an American president during a time of war," Netanyahu said to Biden. “Thank you, Mr. president. Thank you for standing with Israel today, tomorrow and always.”
Former President Donald Trump – who took actions such as relocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem – was widely popular in Israel during his presidency as well. Trump and other Republicans aligned themselves with the Israeli right, pushing a wedge between Jews and their historic support for Democrats, while some liberals in Congress sought to reduce foreign aid to Israel.
Yet over the last week, Biden has received glowing reviews from conservatives who once criticized Biden's foreign policy with Israel.
"In Judaism there is an obligation of 'Hakarat Hatov'”' — saying thank you to those who perform good deeds," David Friedman, former U.S. ambassador to Israel under Trump, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. While Friedman remains "deeply critical" of the Biden administration, he said "the moral, tactical, diplomatic and military support that it has provided Israel over the past few days has been exceptional."
Meanwhile, Trump stunned conservative Israelis with his comments last week blaming Netanyahu for the Hamas attack and calling leaders of Hezbollah "very smart." Many have since blasted Trump's remarks.
"Every Israeli should pray that Biden will continue for a second term," Ishay Cohen, a religiously conservative Israeli journalist, wrote on X above a video with Trump's comments.
Biden's actions have not been without harsh criticism among conservatives in the U.S. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican candidate for president, slammed Biden for committing $100 million in U.S. humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
"They say it's 'humanitarian assistance.' We know Hamas is going to commandeer that money and Hamas is going to use it to advance terrorism," DeSantis said. "How are you funding them when they're holding Americans as well as others hostage?"
And Republicans and Israelis alike criticized the Biden administration over a deal to free five American hostages from Iran that included transferring $6 billion to the nation for humanitarian purposes.
The U.S. and Qatar reportedly agreed to freeze Iran's access to the money last week after the agreement came under fire from Republicans who argued the money freed up funds for Tehran to help Hamas' attack. The Biden administration has said there is no evidence linking Iran to the massacre.
Still, Israel's support for Biden, at least for now, overshadows the pushback.
Ruby Chen, the father working to free his hostage son from Hamas, said Biden told family members on last week's Zoom call "nothing is more important" to him than seeing the safe return of American hostages.
As each family member spoke, a photo of their loved one flashed on the computer screen for the president to see. The meeting ended up lasting about an hour and 15 minutes.
"It was a very emotional session where he also shared some of his personal loss and how he copes with it," Ruby Chen said. "And I think simple people like us, having the president of the United States spend time with us, it was a touching gesture."

FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. – Desmond Ridder was the picture of NFL growing pains as he talked about turning the page on a disastrous ending last weekend while, well, looking ahead to a chance to make a claim on first place.
Ridder, the green Atlanta Falcons quarterback, is coming off the first three-interception game of his young NFL career. That left a lot of explaining for his media session before Wednesday’s practice.
"You try to obviously learn from the mistakes that were made … but you don’t dwell on those interceptions," said Ridder, whose next chance to make amends comes on Sunday at Tampa Bay (3-2) in a matchup that will determine the lead in the NFC South.
Survive long enough as an NFL quarterback and there will be weeks like this. Heat like this, with hot-take analysts suggesting the quarterback take a seat on the bench. The Falcons (3-3) lost an eight-point game against Washington after two of their final three drives ended with picks by the second-year quarterback. The other possession was rather ugly, too; the ball was turned over on downs that included a sack and two incompletions.
Talking turnovers, Ridder, 24, insisted there wasn’t a connecting thread. Was it accuracy or the play design? Bad decisions or bad routes?
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
"There were a couple things on each, where I could’ve made a better read, we could’ve ran a better route, or miscommunication," he said. "Or all three. So, there’s little parts in that entire game – not only with myself but with the whole offense. It’s got to be all 11 guys working on the same page."
In rolling with a young quarterback, the Falcons knew there would be some turbulence along the way with this learning curve. Ridder is surrounded by a strong cast of supporting weapons including first-round picks Bijan Robinson, Kyle Pitts and Drake London. And the defense has improved, allowing them to stay in games.
Yet as natural as it is for the quarterback to attract scrutiny, the crunch-time meltdown on Sunday – which included glaring clock management issues on top of the picks – wasn’t all on Ridder. Arthur Smith, the Falcons coach and play-caller, has fingerprints on this, too.
The Falcons’ operational process during the final minutes was a mess. On at least three occasions, the play-clock nearly ran out as Ridder prepared to call for the snaps. Atlanta probably uses as many personnel packages as any team in the league, which can help create matchup advantages but also requires frequent substitutions. And the unit uses an extensive amount of pre-snap motion, which can also chew up time.
In any event, this stuck out as the issues piled up on Sunday. During one sequence, the flow was so sloppy that after Ridder spiked the football to kill the clock, the Falcons still had to use a timeout as the 25-second play-clock was about to expire.
Asked about the operational issues, Smith fired back with arithmetic.
"Two-thousand plays the last two years," Smith said. "Things happen. They are all different. I wouldn’t call that some catastrophic trend. Now they shouldn’t happen. But they’re all different, why they happened. You identify the problem. But you take three plays out of 2,360…"
But still. It’s what happened lately. The mishaps on Sunday came with the game on the line.
"We can play this game all day," defended Smith, in his third season at the helm. "What about Houston? What about New York?"
In Week 5, the Falcons used a 10-play, 56-yard drive to beat the Texans 21-19 with a Younghoe Koo field goal as time expired. In Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, they executed a 12-play, 66-yard drive for Koo’s game-winning field goal with just under a minute on the clock. The New York game referenced was Smith’s first victory as Falcons coach, in Week 3 in 2021, when his team beat the Giants as then-quarterback Matt Ryan directed a seven-play, 56-yard drive that culminated with a Koo field goal as time expired.
"We’ve won a lot of games handling those situations," Smith added. "Obviously, we didn’t do it last week. We’ve got to get it fixed. This isn’t a trend, a runaway story. Acknowledge what happened. Fix it…Those things happened. That’s not the only reason we lost the game."
Smith pointed to the turnovers, maintaining that NFL teams this season have won just 6% of the games when committing three turnovers.
"Go back to Houston, and those guys executed pretty damn good," Smith said.
Ridder didn’t dispute the mishaps with the operational flow, which typically include the process of getting the play-call from the sideline in addition to the substitutions. Ryan, the previous quarterback, was sometimes frustrated with the process during his one season working with Smith. Now Ridder, while not pointing a finger at his coach, is dealing with similar issues.
He summed it up as a matter of paying better attention to detail, yet he also acknowledged the challenges with communication….especially as the play-clock winds down.
"It makes you speed things up faster," Ridder said. "That’s something we don’t want to do. It goes back to communication. Everybody knowing where they’re supposed to be…just the details with those plays."
Two of Ridder’s teammates, Pitts and London, commended their quarterback for keeping a calm demeanor amid the late-game chaos.
"He’s even-keeled," Pitts said. "When stuff is getting out of control, that’s not when you want to crumble. He’s good at keeping his composure."
Now Ridder – and the rest of his unit – will have to prove capable of growing from the hard lessons.
It's possible the NFL has never looked cooler.
That was perfectly evident Sunday, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers became the most recent team to throw it back, breaking out their beloved – beloved? – "Creamsicle" uniforms for the first time since 2012. (The NFC South-leading Bucs even got into the spirit of the occasion, capsizing in a 20-6 loss to the Lions – very reminiscent of their feckless performances during a two-decade run in "Florida Orange" from 1976-96.)
But that throwback comeback will hardly be the last – and if you don’t already know what’s coming in Weeks 7 and 8, you’ll be thrilled to see other classic uniforms coming out of mothballs. Even better, some fresh fashion-forward alternates are also coming down the pike.
Naturally, not every team is successfully leveraging the new opportunities the league has afforded with the use of secondary helmets and alternate and/or retro color schemes. So let’s take this haberdashery interlude to do a deep dive on NFL couture and rank the alternate uniforms from best to worst:
Sunday night, y’all – Kelly Green (with silver pants and helmet wings) is finally back after Nike finally dialed in the color fabrication. The “Midnight Green” scheme that’s been synonymous with Jeffrey Lurie’s ownership is underappreciated, not to mention championship-certified. But Kelly should always be an option in Philly’s palette, and its 13-year absence has been far too lengthy. (And a nice unintended consequence? Using the Kelly helmets twice this season precludes the return of last year’s alternate black tops.)
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
So nice to see “Bucco Bruce” return after an 11-year hiatus. And it seems retro is here to stay – at least intermittently – moving forward, the Bucs claiming on their website: “Creamsicle is a link between past and present. Of heroes come and gone. On this bridge between eras, it’s up to all of us to pass the torch. This is not a throwback. It’s our heart and soul. The core of who we are.” Maybe that’s a bit much for a team that was so abjectly bad during their inaugural Creamsicle phase, but pretty cool the Buccaneers have embraced their history – and the two post-Bucco Lombardi Trophies have surely helped. And that leads to another point: Tampa’s new-ish all-pewter alternates are perhaps the most underrated uniform of the Color Rush ilk.
Tampa Bay's expansion brethren from 1976 will also be turning back the clock to their original silver, blue and green look – complete with the less-caffeinated Seahawk – in Week 8. Not since 2001, before the ‘Hawks moved into their current stadium, have we seen the unis made famous by Steve Largent, Cortez Kennedy, Kenny Easley and Curt Warner. It’s a very nice offset to the attention-grabbing highlighter-green alternates.
“Old gold,” black and white looks good in virtually any combination – aside from those regrettable gold jerseys they tried in 2002 – whether in a callback to the team’s earliest looks from the 1960s or the monochrome white or black combos utilized in the current era. But the Saints really hit a home run with the alternate black helmet introduced last year, one that featured their iconic fleur-de-lis logo in gold on the side with a stream of smaller ones in a tapering pattern down the center line – similar to the feathers used by the Seahawks.
They’re now 3-0 in the “White Bengal” presentation – which finally includes a white helmet – after it debuted last year and returned in Week 3 against the Rams. Spectacular. It will resurface for Week 13’s Monday nighter against Jacksonville, too … though not before we have to endure the return of the team’s additional orange jersey.
The white “Pat Patriot” helmet and its throwback kit – a callback to AFL royalty – blessedly reappeared last year, just in time to spruce up a team that’s gone with a pretty basic look … to include the basic product Bill Belichick and Co. are currently putting on the field.
The next time we seem them on the field – Week 8, following their bye – they won’t quite be evoking AFL royalty … but only because their famously glorious, “Luv Ya Blue” Houston Oilers look with the white helmet and Columbia Blue oil derrick didn’t come into existence until 1975 and was last featured by the Tennessee Oilers in 1998. But the Titans have finally gone back to their roots and will even be shoving it in the faces of their H-Town replacements, the Texans, in Week 15. "It's been a long time coming," said Hall of Fame Oilers QB Warren Moon, who also hopes the Titans will get to wear the jerseys in Houston someday in appreciation of those fans.
They finally came to their senses and brought back their slick J-E-T-S logo from the 1980s in the “Legacy White” package they’ve already used to honor the “New York Sack Exchange” twice this season – including opening night. You remember, when new QB Aaron Rodgers got the win in his glorious NYJ debut. Moving forward, boys, let’s continue catching up to the Giants by also adding a home green jersey to pair with the flashback Boeing-esque sigil. After that, let’s maybe consider an entirely radical logo – which actually incorporates the silhouette of a jet fighter – and slap that on your crowns while scrapping the dopey Stealth Black helmet introduced in 2022.
When it comes to the extra uniform – forgettable throwbacks or gray Color Rush – they’ve done alternate in pretty much the most forgettable ways. Until now. Make sure you see Week 8’s Monday night game at Ford Field, when the Lions will break out their new metallic “Honolulu Blue” helmets featuring their 1960s alternate logo plus two stripes – the display effectively a nice co-brand with Ford’s famous Mustang, another icon from the ‘60s. Very cool way to commemorate what’s already becoming a memorable season between the lines for the NFC North leaders, not to mention the franchise’s 90th year as the Lions.
You could argue – and I have – no club has better unis. Not only that, since moving back to LA and updating their closets in 2020, they’ve given themselves so many mix-and-match scenarios, in addition to the royal blue and navy (with corresponding helmet lightning bolt) Color Rush options. But as much as folks used to pine for their Powder Blue alternates – which have lost just a little luster in the current iteration – now it’d be nice if the Bolts could either bring back the royal helmet with sunshine-y lightning used in the Air Coryell days, or the navy buckets with white bolts rocked by Junior Seau, LaDainian Tomlinson and so many others. (For the record, love the navy and white.)
Let’s commend them for maximizing the use – three appearances this season – of the retro red helmets and original logo with the black, white and gold striping mix meant to honor both the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech. Wouldn’t mind occasionally seeing the classic falcon on the black helmets as a callback to the Deion Sanders days, but that can wait. At least we won’t be subject to those vile gradient alternate jerseys in 2023.
Little reason to mess with something that’s practically perfect, but their deviations work well. The “Steel Curtain” era throwbacks won’t pop off the screen, but the 1970s number font style is the giveaway. Pittsburgh’s all-black Dark Knight look is among the best alternates going – especially when you consider the mistake it would be to revive some of the club’s awful appearances from yesteryear, bumblebees, shoulder swatches and whatnot.
Sunday afternoon, they’re going to roll out their new “Indiana Nights” one-off for 2023. Couple of thoughts here. They’ve added black helmets because Indy fans allegedly demanded them, and they play into the nocturnal theme – fine … aside from the fact the Colts have zero prime-time games this year. Otherwise, this is fairly boss. The secondary logo – with the state of Indiana serving as the center of the “C” for Colts on the shoulder is a plus. But the “heather pattern” used for the blue-on-blue uniform – golfers will recognize it immediately – really distinguishes this get-up.
Never too far afield, their alternates provide truly nice subtleties. They reverted to the “Purple People Eaters” days while rocking "The Vikings Classic” in Week 1. And keep your eyes peeled for the perfectly pleasing and pristine purple-and-gold alternates.
It’s not quite as slick as the retro Jets, but Sunday night marked this season’s first usage of the block GIANTS logo – with the white Color Rush road treatment – Big Blue used for the final quarter of the 20th century. It will return twice more in 2023, both at home when the Giants can also sport their Lawrence Taylor-Bill Parcells era blue jerseys.
A shame they’re not donning their old-school look this week, perfectly timed to the 1972 team popping champagne as the last unbeatens (49ers, Eagles) of the 2023 season suffered their first setbacks. But the Fins will be kitted in their original unis in Week 8 and again in Week 16. (In the future, perhaps let’s consider a new dome with a watery, shimmery look for the aquatic mammals? Maybe?)
They’ll continue wearing the duds – with shaded jersey numbers – the 1994 Super Bowl champions made famous, sporting the red version twice this season and the white roadies once.
Their 2020 rebrand has aged fairly well so far – doesn’t hurt when you win the Super Bowl in your new threads. It’s also helped that they’ve deemphasized the “bone” jerseys and pants originally intended as their roadies to a more seldom-utilized alternative.
Let’s issue belated credit for this season’s very clean uniform reboot, the whites (with a new dash of silver) especially evocative of their long-gone days in St. Louis. The alternate all-blacks, plus helmet, that debuted in Week 5 still seem extraneous. But, fine, whatever. Cardinals can only be so badass.
Their latest rebrand has gone so well … that new ownership is already mulling yet another one. But the alternate black uniforms topped with the black lids are the least-objectionable aspect – the usage of the D.C. flag on the right shoulder (in burgundy and gold) and back of the helmet the deftest touch.
They're one of several old-school organizations that’s never embraced hindsight or foresight flair especially well. The green jerseys with gold numbers paired with green pants in recent years have been a marked step forward … but another could be taken with a fresh second helmet to top it off.
Never been a huge fan of their 1960s-era throwbacks, whether home or away – and they’ll sport both this season. In Monday night’s win, they topped it with their alternate white-shelled helmet adorned with the current star insignia. Meh.
They added a black helmet to the wardrobe last year and have evidently decided it would look better atop their “Panther Blue” jerseys than as part of a monochrome blackout. Low bar, but agreed … not that it’s likely to help them win a game.
What is it with 1995 feline expansion teams? Thankfully, the Jags are finding their way back from the black-and-gold, two-toned wilderness. But nothing inspiring, or especially objectionable, in their black and (mostly) teal look at present.
They’ve got multiple ways to mix and match their various (dark) colors, the best alternate the purple on purple with gold jersey numbers. The original logo Baltimore used from 1996 to ’98 was one of the busier ones in NFL history … and might be fun to break out periodically for nostalgic purposes – especially if we could see those ugly black pants with the fat white stripe from the days of Ravens yore.
The NFL’s youngest franchise is also the only one to never change its crest. Tradition – yay. But last year, the Texans really stepped out by adding a metallic “Battle Red” helmet to go with the alternate jerseys branded the same way. Yaaawn.
This ranking is more a penalty that they’re not doing more than interspersing the alternate red jersey and pants. Let’s mix that grazing bison from the AFL days into heavier rotation and work up another lid – meaning something more imaginative than just taking the red shells from the 1990s Super Bowl teams out of mothballs.
For years, pretty much everything they’ve touched has turned to horse scat. Extend that to their attempt at merging their history with an edgy look. This year’s “snowcapped” (read: white) helmets adorned with the Orange Crush and Elway-era D logo might have worked … if the Broncos had been able to wear all white instead of Color Rush orange. It just wound up looking like a … melted creamsicle? It returns in Week 16 if you were fortunate enough to miss it the first time.
Let’s acknowledge there isn't much to do historically for a franchise that opted for a hideous color scheme and no primary logo. And rolling out a “retro” white helmet based on a leather model from the 1950s … is something – though perhaps preferable to slapping the Keebler Elf on there, something only Ja’Marr Chase would fancy. While on some level we appreciate the Browns’ decades-long holdout on helmet symbology, couldn’t we bend that rule in the alternate space? Especially after the wicked subsidary logo they unveiled earlier this year with the input of fan votes?
A shame a franchise so steeped in a century-plus’ worth of tradition – which also means it probably shouldn’t be looking especially chic – looks like such jack… Sorry, looks like such jack-o'-lanterns in their orange jerseys and new orange helmets. Stick with the winged University of Michigan knockoffs – yes, the Bears briefly wore them first in the 1930s – and call it a day. Better yet, let’s wind back to the 1960s and occasionally re-adopt the white version of the familiar “C” logo and truly honor the late Dick Butkus and Gale Sayers.
In my most recent overarching uniform power rankings, their iconic look ranked No. 1. And, as expressed elsewhere, it’s sometimes foolish to mess with magnificence. But the Silver and Black are being ranked last here mostly to put them on notice while serving a complacency penalty. The white Color Rush and white throwback jersey (with silver numbers) they’ve utilized in recent years are totally ... fine. But there’s a real opportunity to take their sinister look to a new, Darth Vader-caliber level a few times a year. Black pants? Black helmets with a chrome Raiders shield? Seriously, Mark Davis, what are we waiting for here? Commit to uniform excellence!
Pulling on the red pants is as frisky as they get, so no alternates or throwbacks to assess. And a team based in K.C. has little reason to dust off its long-ago Dallas Texans roots. As far as anything in the pipeline? “I think we have a very distinct brand with the red and white, and I don’t anticipate steering away from that any time soon,” owner Clark Hunt revealed this year, saying he also wanted to honor the wishes of his later father – AFL and team founder Lamar Hunt – who wanted uniform continuity. Welp, it wins.

Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson will indeed undergo shoulder surgery that will end his rookie season after just four games. Team owner Jim Irsay made the announcement Wednesday.
The news doesn't come as a surprise after Irsay told ESPN on Monday that Richardson would "probably" miss the rest of the regular season, with surgery possible in the next week or so. Richardson suffered a reported Grade 3 AC joint sprain in his shoulder during a Week 5 win over the Tennessee Titans and was placed on injured reserve last week.
The No. 4 overall pick in April's NFL draft missed two games and left two others early as the Colts have gotten off to a 3-3 start.
"After consultation with our medical staff, Anthony, and those close to him, it has been determined that he will undergo surgery to repair his injured shoulder, which will end his season," Irsay said in a statement. "Anthony is a competitor, and we know how difficult and disappointing this is for him and our team.
"We collected several medical opinions and we felt this was the best course of action for his long-term health. We anticipate a full recovery and there is no doubt Anthony has a promising future."

In the meantime, veteran Gardner Minshew has taken over at quarterback. He threw for 329 yards on Sunday against Jacksonville, but committed four turnovers in a 37-20 loss. Third-year quarterback Sam Ehlinger, who started three games in 2022, becomes Minshew’s backup, and the Colts also have former Vikings third-rounder Kellen Mond on the practice squad.

An Oct. 17 Instagram post (direct link, archive link) claims veteran actor Arthur Roberts has secretly been Joe Biden’s body double.
“The title of the video in Arthur’s acting credit is ‘Joe Biden Sworn in as U.S. President on Inauguration Day 2021,’” a man says in an embedded video, as an image of a screenshot from IMDB.com appears. “Now when you go to this page, it’s not there no more. It’s been erased. But we got screenshots.”

There is no evidence that President Joe Biden has a body double. Roberts has no association with Biden and has never appeared as him, according to the actor’s representative.
Roberts, an 85-year-old actor, has numerous stage, screen and film credits, according to his professional website and IMDB profile. None of those roles involved playing Biden, and he has no connection to the president.               
“It is not true,” said Kathryn Boole, a manager with Studio Talent Group, which represents Roberts. “Arthur is an actor. He is in his 80s, but he does auditions all the time and he gets roles and he works in the film and TV industry. And he would never even have time to be a double.”
Boole said this claim previously surfaced several years ago when Roberts was edited into pictures that were shared on social media.
The current version of the claim hinges on an IMDB entry that listed Roberts as playing Biden at his 2021 inauguration. The linked page is now dead, and the credit has been removed from his profile on the site. But an archive of the page shows it was on IMDB on Aug. 19 and taken down no later than Sept. 15.
Users can submit a request to add a TV or movie title or an on-screen credit to IMDB, according to its guidelines. Those are supposed to be reviewed by editors before they can be published.
IMDB did not respond to a request for comment. Boole said she had no idea how that credit was attached to Roberts and had no record of him ever portraying Biden in any project.

A second co-defendant with Donald Trump in the Georgia election conspiracy case, Sidney Powell, pleaded guilty Thursday to a half-dozen misdemeanors dealing with a conspiracy to interfere in the 2020 election.
Legal experts said Powell's central role in the conspiracy, as an election lawyer who baselessly claimed widespread election fraud in 2020, could have an impact on other defendants charged in the alleged racketeering conspiracy that sought to keep Trump in power.
“Miss Powell is at the vortex, the center, the hub of the alleged conspiracy,” said Gene Rossi, who handled Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations cases in his three decades as a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official. “She will be a phenomenal witness for the government because she was at strategic meetings, part of important conversations and she was a leader in implementing the scheme to discredit the lawful election of Joe Biden.”
Powell was initially charged with racketeering and six other counts as part of a wide-ranging scheme to overturn the election so Trump could remain in power. She was charged with tampering with election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia.
She pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit theft by taking and five counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with performance of election duties. Powell agreed to testify in future trials in exchange for serving six years of probation, a $6,000 fine and paying restitution of $2,700.
Powell is one of 19 co-defendants charged in the case, which alleged a broad racketeering conspiracy. Other portions of the conspiracy included the recruitment of fake presidential electors to vote for Trump despite President Joe Biden winning Georgia, lying about election results to state officials and in court records, and soliciting public officials to violate their oaths of office.
Legal experts said Powell's agreement to testify against others in the case is "very significant" because she dealt at length with Trump, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others charged in the conspiracy.
"I think it's very significant because she is one of the people who was closest to Trump in many of these alleged nefarious activities, and as part of the agreement, she must testify truthfully against Trump as well as the other defendants,' said John Banzhaf, a George Washington University law professor who has been following the case closely. "So it is a major victory for Fani Willis and certainly a major concern for Trump."
Powell worked closely with major figures in the chase. She participated in a news conference with Giuliani and co-defendant Jenna Ellis at the Republican National Committee portraying baseless allegations of election in November 2020. Powell met with Trump at the White House, including on Dec. 18, 2020, to discuss having the military seize voting machines, which Trump didn't order.
"Given the central role she played in public promotion of false claims of election fraud, it seems likely that she has significant information about the role of her co-defendants," said Alexander Reinert, a Benjamin Cardozo School of Law professor.
Kevin O’Brien, a former federal prosecutor now at Ford O’Brien Landy, called it a “very, very smart move” for Powell to pay a fine, avoid jail and keep her law license.
“Rudy Giuliani, as if he doesn't have enough to worry about, should be very worried,” O’Brien said. “Remember those press conferences the two  gave on all their ‘evidence’ of election interference?”
Rossie said Powell's guilty plea may persuade others to cooperate with prosecutors, turning "the slippery slope into a luge when it comes to cooperators."
Powell is the second co-defendant to plead guilty in the case, after bail bondsman Scott Hall.
The other 17 co-defendants have all pleaded not guilty. Powell’s guilty plea came days before her trial was scheduled to begin Monday. Another co-defendant, lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, who is charged with developing the scheme to recruit fake electors, still has a trial scheduled Monday.
While Powell was involved in a separate part of the conspiracy from Chesebro, Banzhaf said her guilty plea could affect him because he continues to face charges with a five-year minimum sentence and no opportunity for a federal pardon.
"I think it's also likely to convince Chesebro because he's in exactly the same boat," Banzhaf said. "Also, it's going to leave him standing alone in the courtroom. If the two of them were tried together at least they have each other, so to speak, a little bit of mutual support. Now he's going to be on his own and his attorney's going to have to work twice as hard."
Prosecutors initially charged Powell with conspiring with Hall and others to access election equipment without authorization and hired computer forensics firm SullivanStrickler to send a team to Coffee County, to copy software and data from voting machines and computers there.
The indictment said an unnamed person sent an email to a top SullivanStrickler executive and instructed him to send all data copied from Dominion Voting Systems equipment in Coffee County to an unidentified lawyer associated with Powell and the Trump campaign.
Iowa state Rep. Brad Sherman took the stage at a Cedar Rapids auditorium as supporters of Donald Trump continued to file in, buzzing as they awaited the arrival of the former president.
Sherman began Saturday afternoon's program with a prayer.
"This is not a time for politics as usual, not a time for religion as usual, not a time for prayers as usual," said the Williamsburg Republican, who is also a pastor at Solid Rock Church in Coralville.
He prayed for Israel, which had been attacked by Hamas a day earlier, and said "we're at war in this nation as well" — a "spiritual war," in which the Republican frontrunner for president is on the front lines.
"They've shot their lying arrows at him, Lord, without cause," Sherman said of Trump. "His family and all those who seek good have become targets. … Lord, injustice is hanging over this nation like a dark storm."
Prayers and invocations like Sherman's are not unusual on the presidential campaign trail in Iowa, where Republican politicking intertwines itself with the Christian evangelical leanings shared by many potential caucusgoers.
Some devotions are directed at candidates — calling on God to "release your strategic planning upon President Trump," as a prayer in Ottumwa declared, or asking for attendees to "hear Vivek (Ramaswamy)'s heart," as Kimberly Chapman did at an event for the candidate in West Des Moines.
A few take aim at political opponents: A prayer to kick off a Tim Scott event in August asked the attendees to realize that those on the left "hate you, hate your word, in many cases hate our country."
The prayers, often accompanied by a pledge of allegiance and the national anthem, provide a glimpse into how religious leaders and attendees channel their frustrations with President Joe Biden, their fervor for a candidate or their policy priorities through their faith — at a time when division and unease increasingly define American politics.
"I think there's a high anxiety within people of faith, and it seems to be increased," said Bob Vander Plaats, CEO of conservative Christian advocacy group The Family Leader. "But I would say that it's kind of a broader reflection on the culture as a whole."
Iowa caucuses:Track candidates' visits to Iowa
Sherman, who has endorsed Trump, believes both religion and politics "have drifted far away from what we were originally." Moving toward an electoral process fully imbued in faith, he says, is necessary to fight the "spiritual war" he spoke of on stage in Cedar Rapids.
"Few people seem to think about the fact that if demons and demonic spirits exist, then that means angels exist as well," he told the Register in an interview. "They're doing battle in the spirit."
The outcomes of those battles, he says, "often have a big effect on what's happening in the natural" world — including the results of the Iowa caucuses.
War in Ukraine, and now between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East, has lent a new urgency to those invocations. At an event for Ron DeSantis on Oct. 8, the Rev. Jeremy Higgins of Calvary Community Church, who said he had visited Israel 17 times, led a prayer in support of the country's military and civilians.
"Your word tells us to pray for the peace of Jerusalem, so Lord, we do that, but also the nation of Israel as a whole," Higgins said. "And we also want to lift up the men and women in Gaza who aren't a part of these terrorist organizations, and there are so many who live there … who love you, Lord God, and have nothing to do with this."
That uncertainty abroad, combined with a critical primary cycle for the future of the Republican Party and a large chunk of religious voters in Iowa, has prompted some to demand even more direct involvement in the caucus process from parishes and faith leaders.
"I would be really, really glad, and I think some of the candidates, to really encourage more involvement by the faith community," Linn County Republican chair Bernie Hayes told the Register. "I feel that at least in circles that I run in, it's lackadaisical. They run from the word 'political.'"
In the eyes of many faith leaders, the crowd of presidential hopefuls is more than just politicians vying for support in the first-in-the-nation caucus state — they're "instruments" of faith, given "assignments" and "callings" to lead, and "serve the interests of God."
Chapman, the Iowa lobbyist who serves as an adviser to Ramaswamy's campaign, said she had prayed and attended church alongside the entrepreneur and author. Though Ramaswamy is Hindu, she said, he "welcomes Christian prayer."
"Vivek, when you talk about being an instrument, and God using you as an instrument, that reminds me and my Christian faith of God using us as a vessel, is how we would say that," Chapman said as she introduced the candidate in West Des Moines earlier this month.
Other expressions of faith toward the candidates are more direct, even physical: at a Des Moines church in September, Rep. Jon Dunwell, R-Newton, led a prayer in which a group gathered around DeSantis and laid hands on him.
Many are looking for the next torchbearer for what former President Ronald Reagan called a "spiritual revival," Vander Plaats said, centering faith in the world of conservative politics. (For his part, Vander Plaats has expressed a desire for the GOP to move on from Trump.)
Candidates traveling through Iowa aim to position themselves as the best one to usher in that revival — attending church, shaking hands and courting endorsements from faith leaders, and emphasizing their opposition to abortion.
The former president, who generally speaks little of his own faith, is preceded on stage at rallies by prayer, and leans on his record and previous support among evangelical voters.
But such prayers on the campaign trail shouldn't "have a personal agenda," Vander Plaats said, and should be focused on seeing "God's will be done" by an elected leader.
"Ultimately what you're doing in the act of prayer itself is recognizing that God is God, and you are not," Vander Plaats said, chuckling and adding "that seems to be a problem we have today."
Sherman believes that "God does place assignments, callings" on people, and that includes candidates for elected office. He's not concerned by those who don't believe in blending prayer and politics.
"You can take just the flip side of that and say, well, I'm uncomfortable with people that don't believe in it," he said. "Christianity never forces itself on anyone. I mean, you can't legislate a heart change inside of somebody."
"I will stand for people's right to believe whatever they want to believe, that's freedom," Sherman added. "But I'm not going to be muzzled from telling what I believe."

During one of the busiest periods in the still early 2024 presidential campaign, White House hopefuls are making a civic pilgrimage to New Hampshire.
The Republican contenders are chatting with people at diners, coffee shops and bookstores. Some are trekking to the state capitol in Concord to sign their name at a historic desk to be on the ballot.
Others are sharing their messages through several town halls and other stops, including a GOP dinner that happens once every eight years. 
Voters have a message, too: some of you need to drop out.
"It’s still early. There's still a lot on that stage," said Laura Williams, a registered Republican from Rochester, N.H., who plans to vote in the primary. "Let some weed themselves out, and those that rise to the top, you know, we’ll wait it out and see."
Whether Granite State natives or political tourists traveling across states lines to get a closer glimpse at the candidates, many are wishing for fewer options after what some called a disastrous second primary debate hosted by the Republican National Committee in California.
"Frankly, I was put off by all their debate performances in the last one. They were all talking over one another," Vaughn Annis, a retired chemical engineer, told USA TODAY. 
"The field was too crowded on that stage to get anything as a meaningful debate."
Annis, a registered Republican who hails from Henniker, N.H., hasn't made up his mind on a presidential candidate, but he is giving Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott closer attention.
A candidate he would like to see exit this race is former Donald Trump, the frontrunner with a commanding lead.
"Where I have voted in the past for him, I think Trump needs to step aside and let others move forward, younger people in the party that aren't as controversial," Annis said. "I think that would be helpful for not only the party but also the country."
A USA TODAY/Boston Globe/Suffolk University survey of likely voters showed Trump at 49% with Haley, a former South Carolina governor, the closest rival at 19%.
The non-Trump voters say they are hoping one of the other Republicans can break through, but they are by no means certain that's possible. 
Larry Provencher, a semi-retired artist in Exeter, N.H., fears Trump may be the Republican nominee, adding how he believes the former president "just lost a few upstairs."
He said when interacting with voters, the other candidates need to share their vision in detail and forget about the frontrunner.
"You know, like, Chris Christie, I think his main goal is to get Trump out. I want to hear what else you're gonna do," Provencher said.
Those in the anti-Trump camp said they are hoping if some of the other candidates exit, they will unite behind a single challenger. In the most recent example, former Rep. Will Hurd, of Texas, left the race and endorsed Haley.
Haley, a former UN ambassador, has surged in the New Hampshire poll ahead DeSantis, the governor of Florida who was once held as chief alternative to Trump.
Norman Stuart, a veteran and retired machine shop worker, attended a Haley event at the Rochester American Legion last week. He was impressed with her, but he remains undecided.
Although Stuart said he was considering several of the candidates, who he declined to name, he stated emphatically: "I did not go to Wolfeboro to see Trump."
That provides a glimmer of light for the other Republicans, who hold out hope that despite Trump's strong standing in the polls, there are some signs the race is fluid.
Those surveyed in the Suffolk poll, for instance, are split 48%-44% when asked whether Trump's nomination was inevitable or whether some other candidate could win the nomination.
Nearly 4 in 10 said they might change their minds before the January primary.
But the Trump base is fiercely loyal, with 84% saying their minds were made up to back him and just 15% saying they might switch to someone else.
“I know a lot of people don't like him. I don't like his personality. I think it stinks," said Ronald Sassi, of Chichester, N.H., who wants Trump to win. "But he doesn't have any lobbyists telling him what he has to be or beholden to them." 
Jo-Ann Jacob, an independent from Exeter, N.H., doesn't want to rush in making a choice before she gets a chance to hear from more candidates.
Several of the Republican contenders are "too much" in the sense they brag about themselves or insult others. She prefers the more somber style of North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum or former Vice President Mike Pence, who she describes as more "down to Earth."
Both men are in the basement of the polling at 1%, according to the Suffolk University survey.
Other independent voters, who can participate in the New Hampshire GOP primary, said they aren't sure what to make of the current field yet.
“At this point, I'm really unsure,” Lynne Chase, a registered nurse who lives in Grantham, N.H., told USA TODAY.
Chase, who identifies as an independent, said she has "deep concerns" about the country's partisan divide, and how, "this is the pool that we have to select from." 
"That's why I choose to remain a middle ground voter,” she said.
Other voters said they are drawn toward Haley and Burgum because of their experience and record as their state's chief executive.
“When you govern a state, you have a lot of experience in governing within a structure of government,” Patricia Squires, a Republican from Wolfeboro, N.H., told USA TODAY.
Many voters shared how they aren't crazy about the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch in 2024, but don't see a way to change that probability.
Rachel McKaig, a Democrat, said there is a general frustration that President Joe Biden will be the party’s likely nominee come next November.   
“I genuinely wish we had another candidate,” said McKaig, a University of New Hampshire graduate. "I just can't see him doing anything amazing over the next four years, because he hasn't done anything amazing in the past four years.”  
Given its status as the "first-in-the-nation primary," New Hampshire draws a fair amount of out-of-state visitors.
Those voters said they were impressed with lesser-known candidates they had a chance to see in-person, but admit there is an underlying pessimism that makes it hard for others to take that contender seriously.
“I just know that you look at the people who are ascending because that tends to continue," said John Sweeny, a retired appellate judge who came to New Hampsire from Hudson Valley in New York.
"The ones who were staying flat – it would take a miracle for something to happen that they're going to say, ‘Oh, wow, you're wonderful. I didn't notice you before. Let me pay attention to you now,’" he added. "It just doesn't happen."
Shawn Rieke, a retired technician from Johnstown, Colo. who is vacationing in New England, waited outside the old State House for a glimpse of DeSantis after he filed.
People may not like Trump's "crudeness" or the personal attacks he makes, but they agree with him on many issues, he said. They also think the criminal charges against him are politically motivated.
"At this point it looks like it's pretty much locked up," Rieke said. "It is what it is."
Republican Rachel Hannah Swift, 46, who comes from Hagerstown, Maryland said no one is happy with the prospect of a Biden-Trump re-match, and she has a unique response: Running for president herself.
As her colorful car blared pop music outside of the old State House, Swift said: "These politicians are kinda boring...They don't have a lot going on. I'm going to beat both of them." 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted Thursday that the central bank may hold interest rates steady next month amid rising long-term bond yields that could curtail economic growth, effectively doing the work of another rate hike.
At the same time, Powell said that an economy and labor market that continue to run hot could prompt the Fed to raise rates again at some point.
“Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, and longer-term bond yields have been an important driving factor in this tightening,” Powell said in written remarks he planned to deliver at the Economic Club of New York at noon. “We remain attentive to these developments because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy.”
The yield in the 10-year Treasury bond has shot up to 4.9% from 3.2% in March because of a stronger-than-expected economy that could push inflation higher and a large increase in the supply of Treasuries linked to federal government infrastructure and other spending. That's the highest level since 2007.
The rise in Treasury yields has pushed up 30-year mortgage rates close to 8% and driven up borrowing costs for corporations. Those developments will likely further dampen the housing market and hobble business investment.
“Given the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, (the Fed’s policymaking committee) is proceeding carefully,” Powell added.
The Fed has raised its key short-term interest rate by 5.25 percentage points since early last year to fight a historic inflation spike. Recently, however, Powell has said the Fed will move more cautiously since the risk of failing to subdue inflation and causing a recession by hiking rates too aggressively are more balanced.
“Doing too little could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require monetary policy to ring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to employment,” Powell said in his written remarks Thursday. “Doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the economy.”
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Philadelphia Fed chief Patrick Harker both have said the central bank should halt its rate increases.
Yet Powell also noted that economic and job growth have been surprisingly strong recently and that could stall further progress on inflation, which he said has fallen notably.
“Additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth, or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy,” Powell said.
In a research note, Barclays said it expects the Fed to stand pat in November but hike rates again in mid-December. Fed officials are slated to make a decision on rates at the close of a two-day meeting on Nov. 1.
Powell noted that the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is projected to fall 3.7% for September from a peak of 5.6% in early 2022. Still, he added, tht”inflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to our (2%) goal.”
He also said the labor market is “gradually cooling,” with the number of job openings falling from record levels and wage growth easing.  Still employers added a booming 336,000 jobs in September.
And the economy has been resilient despite high inflation and interest rates. Gross domestic product is expected to have increased at a healthy 3.5% annual rate in the third quarter, according to a survey by Wolters Kluwer Blue Chip Economic Indicators. That follows growth of just above 2% the first half of the year.
 “The record suggests that a sustainable return to our 2% inflation goal is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some further softening in labor market conditions,” Powell said.
Cheetos has its own take on the traditional pretzels and cheese sauce snack: new Cheetos Pretzels.
The treat, now hitting stores, comes in two flavors: Cheetos Pretzels Cheddar and Cheetos Pretzels Flamin' Hot.
Each piece has one side that looks like pretzel, made of crispy wheat, while the other is covered in "Cheetle" powdered cheese flavor.
They can be purchased at stores nationwide for $5.69 in 10-ounce bags and $2.49 in 3-ounce bags.
Cheetos isn't a newbie when it comes to experimenting with new combinations. Three years ago its Cheetos Mac 'n Cheese received a lot of attention and launched in three flavors: Bold & Cheesy, Flamin’ Hot and Cheesy Jalapeño.
Mac and cheese ... ice cream?:Kraft Mac & Cheese ice cream is back at Walmart next week along with six new flavors by Van Leeuwen
If you are a Cheetos junkie, there's more to explore among its other new limited release snacks. They include Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Cinnamon Sugar Popcorn, plus all these different flavors of Cheetos: Flamin’ Hot Smoky Ghost Pepper, White Cheddar Bag of Bones, Cinnamon Sugar Bag of Bones, Crunchy Nashville Hot, and Crunchy Flamin’ Hot Tangy Chili Fusion.
Cheetos' parent company Frito-Lay decided to venture into pretzel territory because it found 63% of Cheetos consumers were also buying pretzels and that flavored pretzels have been driving 58% of the pretzel sales growth.
"Our fans are always hungry for unique ways that they can experience Cheetos' signature cheesy flavor, which is why this latest innovation is breaking into an entirely new category," said Tina Mahal, Frito-Lay's senior vice president of marketing, in a press release. "Cheetos pretzels maximize the fan-favorite seasoning in each bite with the perfect product texture, ultimately bringing the Cheetos flavor experience to life in pretzel form."

Here's a hot new product:Vlasic pickles made with Frank's RedHot sauce
Federal safety regulators are recalling tens of thousands of gun safes after they say a child died accessing a firearm inside of one.
According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Fortress Safe, the recall involves about 61,000 biometric gun safes because of a safety hazard and risk of death caused by a programming feature that, in more than three dozen instances, allowed unauthorized access to the safes. 
The recalled safes, which were made in China, were imported and distributed by Xpedition LLC, dba Fortress Safe, of Naperville, Illinois.
"Consumers can believe they have properly programmed the biometric feature when in fact the safe remains in the default to open mode, which can allow unauthorized users, including children, to access the safe to remove hazardous contents, including firearms," the CPSC posted in its Thursday recall.
So far, CPSC said, at least one death has been tied to the issue that prompted the recall.
The agency said "it is aware of a recent lawsuit" claiming a 12-year-old boy died from a firearm obtained from one of the recalled safes. The CPSC did not release additional details about the child's death.
As of Thursday, the agency said, there had been 39 incidents of consumers reporting their safes were accessed by "unpaired" fingerprints.

The CPSC reported the recalled gun safes are portable lock boxes, personal safes, pistol vaults, and gun cabinets with brand names Fortress, Cabela’s, Gettysburg, and Legend Range & Field.
Nine models are being recalled:
Safes being recalled were sold at the following stores: Bass Pro Shops, Cabela’s, Scheel’s, Sportsman’s Guide, Optics Planet, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Gander, Rural King, Lowe’s and online at Amazon.com and Ebay.com.
Retailers sold the safes, manufactured in China, from January 2019 through this month.

An Oregon man may have missed winning the second-largest Powerball lottery ever by one number, but he still walked away with a $1 million prize.
77-year-old Thomas Willard told Oregon Lottery officials he only plays when the jackpots grow to large amounts. He purchased his ticket for the Oct. 9 drawing at the 7 Star Convenience Store in Mill City, a small city about 32 miles east of Oregon's capital, Salem.
The convenience store will receive a $100,000 commission for selling a winning ticket.
A winning ticket sold in California from the next drawing on Oct. 11 claimed the $1.76 billion Powerball jackpot.
"At our age, this is just about right," Willard told lottery officials of his win, which he will enjoy with his wife, Nancy, of 49 years.
Powerball Oct. 18, 2023 drawing:Here are the winning numbers
Nancy was the one who discovered the win, checking their numbers online the morning after the drawing. She initially thought they had won $100,000, but then realized it was the much larger $1 million prize.
"Wake up, you have to see this!" Nancy told her husband.
Players have a year to claim their prize, according to the Oregon Lottery, which also recommend players to consult a trusted financial planner or similar professional in the event of a jackpot win.
Tickets can be purchased in-person at gas stations, convenience stores and grocery stores. Some airport terminals may also sell lottery tickets.

Ahhh. Days at the beach. It’s a perfect day – the crisp air, light breeze, warm sun – oh, and most importantly, your hair looks fantastic. If you have ever liked the “beachy waves” look of your hair after a quick dip in the ocean – you’re in luck! There are many different sea salt sprays available so you can look like you’re coming straight from the beach, no matter where you are.
So what are sea salt sprays? What are they made out of? Are there any downsides? How long do they last, and what do they cost? We answer all of your burning questions about this handy styling product. 
It’s not seawater. But it does contain salt and other minerals like magnesium or potassium. There’s also, usually, a fragrance associated with it. 
These sprays are designed to mimic the way your hair looks after getting out of the ocean. Since seawater contains a high amount of salt, so does sea salt spray. The reason your hair gets curly after getting out of the ocean or using sea salt spray is that the salt pulls moisture out of the hair. The result is that the hair strands begin to lift – just enough to reveal a slightly curly pattern. 
It will stay put until you wash it out. To rephrase: the minerals will stay on your hair until you wash it out. However, the style will likely not stay put for more than a day without the use of a standard hairspray. 
Is sea salt good for you? How it compares to other salts and how to watch your sodium
Everyone could benefit from sea salt spray if they are looking to style their hair in beachy curls. However, people with oily hair can especially benefit from sea salt spray, as the minerals may soak up some of the oil. 
It depends on the brand and the amount of spray you buy. The range is generally $6 to $50.
Too much sea salt spray (or exposure to seawater) can dehydrate or damage your hair. You can combat dehydrated hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. 
Overall, sea salt spray is a safe and stylish choice for your hair!

So the strip came back with two lines, you may not be the first to know. It's a commonly held belief that dogs can sense pregnancy. Some say they even see changes in their pup's behavior before they even know themselves that they are pregnant.
So what, if there is any, is the science behind this? To find out how much of this idea is fact and how much is fiction, we consulted an expert. 
Here's what Dr. Camille Alander, a veterinarian with NYC's Bond Vet had to say about dogs sensing pregnancy. 
While there is no hard scientific backing to the idea, Alander does say that it bodes well for the theory that dogs can sense cancer, decreases in blood sugar, and can help find missing people.
"Dogs have an absolutely incredible sense of smell," she said, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that with the hormone changes caused by pregnancy, a canine might be able to sniff out the condition. 
People absolutely have reported that they knew they were pregnant because their dog began to act differently, Alander said. She jokes that signs from your pup should not be used in lieu of a pregnancy test. 
Do dogs dream?:Here's why they may be dreaming about you
A lot of people report that dogs will become more clingy or more protective, Alander said. 
In a sitting setting, which is where most of Bond Vet's clinics are located, clients have reported that after pregnancy, their dog would become difficult to walk, she said, trying to attack nearly every other dog that passed by. 
Alander also offered up the example of a dog following their owner to the shower in the morning and sitting outside the door until they were done. She described the change in behavior mostly as "subtle things that other people probably wouldn't notice as a change, but because you know your pet well you would probably pick up on." 
Cats have a strong sense of smell just as dogs do, but are not often used in cadaver detection or other pursuits in the same way because they are not as trainable, Alander said. 
It's not out of the question in terms of pregnancy though, she said, saying some clients have told her as soon as they got pregnant their cat wanted to sleep on its belly every night. 
While they might be able to detect pregnancy, the personality change in a cat is not going to be as noticeable, Alander said, because of their general demeanor.

Cars making loud noises are never a good sign and are a particular hassle when the cause of the noise is a missing catalytic converter. 
Catalytic converters are regularly targeted car parts, sometimes stolen right out of driveways. This month, three members of a California family pleaded guilty to their roles in a $600 million catalytic converter theft ring, USA TODAY previously reported.
The theft can cause car owners headaches and up to thousands of dollars. What are catalytic converters, and why are they stolen so often?
Catalytic converters are your car’s way of filtering out harmful engine exhaust pollutants. This exhaust system converts pollutants (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides) into compounds that already make up our atmosphere (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water).
Well-designed catalytic converters can reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions by about 90%, as well as Diesel Particulate Matter emissions by 25-35%. These converters work by using metallic catalysts to drive reactions at lower temperatures than would normally be needed.
Per guidelines from the Environmental Protection Agency, cars made in or after 1975 have catalytic converters to curb pollutants. According to the EPA, starting in 1988, anyone installing or selling a catalytic converter that hasn’t met federal guidelines may face penalties of up to $25,000 for each installation.
Some states have even adopted stricter environmental protections for catalytic converters. The California Air Resources Board requires CARB-compliant catalytic converters, which use an enhanced process to meet the stricter standards for curbing harmful emissions. California and Colorado require all cars to use CARB-compliant catalytic converters. The state of New York requires cars made in 1993, 1994, 1996 and newer to use the converters, and Maine mandates CARB-compliant catalytic converters for cars made in and after 2001.
Catalytic converter thefts are up:How to protect yours from being stolen
Reported catalytic converter thefts increased by 325% between 2019 and 2020. The reason for stolen converters is the explanation behind any theft — money. The rhodium, palladium and platinum used in these parts are valuable, and rhodium can go for $20,000 per ounce, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Palladium costs nearly $3,000 per ounce, and platinum costs about $1,128 per ounce.
Twenty-six states proposed bills in 2021 to prevent catalytic converter theft, with 10 states passing legislation. 
NICB recommends taking precautions to prevent your catalytic converter from getting stolen:
If your catalytic converter was stolen, you may get an engine error code from your vehicle. Because the converter muffles the exhaust sound, you also will notice a louder, unusual sound coming from the exhaust, TheMotorGuy.com reports.
While driving without a catalytic converter is technically possible, you may run into legal issues if you live in a state where emissions tests are required to use the vehicle. Federal law also prohibits the removal of catalytic converters. 
Prices vary when it comes to replacement converters because of the fit of the part. Universal replacements can cost about $200-$300 according to AutoZone, but newer vehicles may require direct-fit converters because the original catalytic converters are incorporated into the exhaust manifold. These direct-fit converters can cost as much as $2,500. 
How to jump start a car:Steps to get your vehicle up and running
USA TODAY is exploring the questions you and others ask every day. From "What is a hybrid car?" to "What kind of car is Lightning McQueen?" to "Why is fossil fuel bad?", we're striving to find answers to the most common questions you ask every day. Head to our Just Curious section to see what else we can answer for you.
Electric and hybrid car sales are on the rise as the Biden administration proposes tougher greenhouse gas emissions for cars and trucks sold in the U.S. Nearly 98 thousand hybrid vehicles were sold in the U.S. in April 2023, which is up over 36% from last year, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Library reports. 
Even more popular are plug-in vehicles – over 105 thousand were sold in April 2023, a number that includes both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles. 
Here’s everything you need to know about the different types of hybrid cars.
Hybrid electric vehicles, also known as HEVs, use an internal combustion engine and electric motors to run. These cars are appropriately named because they are a cross between a gasoline car, which runs on a combustion engine, and an electric car, which uses a battery-operated electric motor. 
There are three main types of HEVs:
PHEVs are often more expensive than mild or full hybrid vehicles, but they generally produce lower levels of emissions because they can run solely on electricity for longer. According to the DOE, current commercially available PHEVs have an electric range of 15 to 60 miles or more. 
Latest car recalls:Nissan, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Ford and more
HEVs use an internal combustion engine and battery-powered electric motor to get the desired result of high fuel economy and low emissions. This is because the extra power from the electric motor allows for a smaller combustion engine. 
PHEVs mostly run on electricity, but they have an internal combustion engine that powers the vehicle when the battery is low or when electricity is being used heavily elsewhere in the car, like in heating or air conditioning. 
There are two main methods of designing hybrid vehicles. Parallel hybrids connect the engine and electric motor to the wheels through mechanical coupling, according to the DOE, while series hybrids use the electric motor exclusively to drive the wheels. 
Typically no – hybrid cars do not need to be charged. Plug-in hybrid vehicles can be charged with charging equipment but also use other methods outside of electric charging to keep the vehicle running. 
Other types of hybrid cars do not need to be charged at all and cannot be plugged in. The battery in a hybrid car is charged through both the internal combustion engine and a process called “regenerative braking,” when the vehicle’s electric motor acts as a generator and captures energy typically lost during braking.

We found room for both hope and pessimism in a recent free expression survey that the University of Chicago helped develop with The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. One of the most worrying results was that not everyone is seen as having the same freedom to speak their minds on college campuses.
People said conservatives had the least freedom to speak, but they perceived problems of exclusion beyond just one group. Asian people also were seen as having less freedom of expression than other groups, and respondents said campuses did the worst at providing an inclusive environment for conservatives, visiting speakers, Asian people and transgender people.
We see related problems for campus expression as people respond to the tragedies of the Israel-Hamas war. Many students don’t feel free to express their views, and some universities risk chilling discussions on their campuses by taking collective positions, sending the message that there is one “official” stance and other opinions are not welcome.
That is a troubling trend in our polarized times. We face huge challenges as a society, and we can’t address them fully if people at colleges and universities – our greatest engines of new thinking and innovation – do not feel free to challenge each other and pursue ideas and breakthroughs wherever they lead.
Sadly, just as the need for new knowledge and discovery becomes more acute, universities have been riddled with challenges to free inquiry from all ideological factions. We find ourselves in something of a moral panic, from which neither the left nor the right is immune. 
But we also see signs that the tide is turning, and fast. Our survey found heartening public support for many aspects of free expression, including bipartisan resistance to state restrictions on what professors at public universities can teach.
Among the encouraging stands that universities are taking on free expression, Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, this year rejected a call for mandatory trigger warnings for potentially offensive course content. In Northern California, Stanford Law Dean Jenny Martinez, who wrote an articulate defense of free expression after the disruption of a talk by U.S. Circuit Judge Kyle Duncan, was appointed provost of the university.
Many schools – including our own – are launching new free inquiry and expression initiatives, while others have adopted the “Chicago Principles” on free expression.
Biden is too old. And so is Trump.As a Gen Z voter, I want younger candidates.
Such bold moves are critical, but they go only so far. To realize the potential of free inquiry we need an active shift in campus culture.
The project of free inquiry and expression is about much more than solitary acts of expression – it’s about unlocking the power of discovery and knowledge in the context of an academic community to address major challenges and promote the flourishing of knowledge.
Freedom of expression on college campuses is not the same as an absence of personal constraint on speech, nor is it grounded primarily on the First Amendment.
Universities are crucibles of truth-seeking, for faculties and students alike. To advance that ideal, they must be places where students and scholars are challenged by alternative viewpoints.
Don't let Israel-Hamas war divide US.We need to cooperate across our differences.
Universities have it in their power to take concrete steps to build stronger cultures of free inquiry and expression, including:
Despite the challenges to free inquiry, we remain enthusiastic about the breakthroughs of human ingenuity and discovery that our colleges and universities will yet make possible. They can’t happen soon enough.
Combining the remarkable burgeoning activity across the higher education landscape with the creativity and passion of Generation Z makes for a very bright future.
Doubling down on free inquiry and expression is the key. Without it, universities will lose all that makes them distinctive.

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan lost votes on his second attempt to become House speaker, an embarrassing setback for a party that seems to specialize in embarrassing itself.
Since ousting former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier this month, the Republican caucus has tried and failed to vote in Rep. Steve Scalise and Jordan, leaving the House leaderless with the clock ticking toward a potential government shutdown and war breaking out in the Middle East.
It’s clearly time for the Republican Party to consider an outsider for the role of speaker of the House, so in the interest of bipartisan helpfulness, I’ve prepared the following LinkedIn-inspired job posting they can use to identify potential candidates.
You’re welcome, Republicans, and good luck filling the position!
Do Republicans want this?Trump is slamming Israel and babbling about Barack Obama. Who would vote for that mess?
💼Title: House Speaker/Republican
👷Job Type: Full-Time with many, many days off
🌏Location: Washington, D.C., and Fox News headquarters in New York City
Job Description:
The Republican Party is seeking an enthusiastic, qualified (or unqualified) conservative interested in leading a not-particularly-dedicated team of politicians in the U.S. House of Representatives through a time of ideological uncertainty. The ideal background would be a person who can unite people with varying views on the importance of democracy and rally them to accomplish as little as possible while still yelling into television cameras in a manner that sounds serious. This position comes with no benefits and, in fact, many drawbacks, but it is a chance for an outgoing and energetic ne’er-do-well to prove themselves to be slightly better than former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and considerably better than failed House Speaker candidate Rep. Jim Jordan, a bar so low even earthworms can clear it.
Responsibilities: 
Qualifications:
Compensation:
Exact compensation may vary based on whether you last more than a week or so before being unceremoniously voted out for not making Gaetz happy enough.
Base salary: $223,500 a year
Perks include free flights on donor jets and a complimentary copy of Donald Trump Jr.’s book “Triggered.”

While the Biden administration was still floating trial balloons regarding support of Israel after the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was making concrete plans to help get Americans trapped in Israel out of harm’s way. More than 30 U.S. citizens have died in the war.
When times are tough, DeSantis is a guy you want to have on your side. 
Last Thursday, he issued an executive order that authorized the emergency response to fly Floridians out of Israel. In the order, DeSantis argued that the Biden administration had been too slow in its effort to get Americans to safety – and that commercial flights had been grounded given the violence in the region. 
Just days later, on Sunday night, a flight of 270 Americans – more than 90 of them children – landed in Tampa on “DeSantis Airlines,” as some have dubbed the effort. DeSantis was on the ground to greet the evacuees.
The relief and gratitude on the passengers’ faces were palpable. And they won’t have to pay the state back – unlike U.S. citizens who call on the federal government to get them out of Israel (which is apparently customary in such instances). Late last week, the State Department began arranging charter flights for Americans stranded in Israel.
More than 300 citizens have returned home to Florida, thanks to the governor – and Project Dynamo, the rescue nonprofit that coordinated the flights.
Florida is home to one of the largest Jewish populations in the world, as well as many dual Israeli American citizens with family in Israel, according to the executive order. DeSantis press secretary Jeremy Redfern told me the rescue mission has cost about $4 million so far and more flights are expected in the days ahead. 
President Joe Biden should send DeSantis a thank-you card. He’s not likely to, however, because DeSantis does actively want Biden’s job. 
DeSantis as governor is impressive, as he has proved during several natural disasters in Florida, as well as effectively running the state government. When things need to get done, that’s when he shines. 
The presidential campaign trail and finding his voice on the national stage have proved more challenging for him. After an initial surge in the polls, DeSantis has struggled to maintain his No. 2 spot behind GOP presidential front-runner and former President Donald Trump. 
Bipartisan corruption scandals:Sure, GOP Rep. George Santos is bad news. But Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez is much worse.
The Florida governor seems to be hitting his stride now, leaning into the leadership qualities that make him an attractive candidate. We need less of the forced culture warrior and more of the capable governor. 
DeSantis also is bolder in his attacks on Trump, and that’s a positive sign. He called out Trump’s poorly thought out comments last week, when the former president slammed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for not being prepared for the attack and called Hezbollah militants “very smart.” It was supposed to be an indirect criticism of Biden, but was typical of Trump’s crass and cringeworthy style.  
“Now is not the time to be attacking our ally,” DeSantis said in New Hampshire last week.
He added: “If you want to change from Trump, I think I’m the best leader.” 
DeSantis’ ability to deliver hundreds of Floridians safely home from Israel is a welcome contrast with the chaos on display among Republicans in the U.S. House in recent weeks.
After a small faction of the party ousted Speaker Kevin McCarthy without having a clue whom they wanted to replace him, the House has been paralyzed in its ability to send aid to Israel after the attack. Not to mention the upcoming fight over funding the government. 
GOP in chaos:2024 should be cakewalk for Republicans, but they're determined to give failing Dems a win
It’s all been a very bad look for Republicans, who should be poised to have a good year in 2024, following Biden’s lackluster presidency and Americans’ continued concerns over the economy.
And most important, conservatives must wake up from their Trump trance and move on to a presidential candidate who can ditch the drama and just do the job well.

In the den of insanity, sanity occasionally wins.
Fingers, toes and elbows crossed the victory will hold.
The U.S. House of Representatives is so far saying "hell no" to the idea of giving Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the speaker's gavel.
The House voted again Wednesday and Jordan lost again. But the fact that Jordan has gotten this far shows Washington isn’t broken. It’s smashed to bits.
It seems some in Jordan’s own Republican caucus has tired of his scorched earth politics. He’s a Trump apologist and election denier who claims he never said the 2020 election was stolen, until he says it was.
“I don’t know how you can ever convince me that President Trump didn’t actually win this thing based on all the things you see,” Jordan told Fox News after the 2020 election.
He wants to impeach President Joe Biden because – no one knows why, beyond some vague allegation of dishonesty. And Jordan advanced an antisemitic trope by spelling the last name of Tom Steyer, a 2020 presidential candidate who identifies as Jewish, $teyer.
Listen up, Republicans.The world is in chaos, so why are you playing stupid games?
All of this pales in comparison with the havoc Jordan could inflict on America as House speaker. As a co-founder of the hard-line Freedom Caucus, he could name a fellow far-right member as speaker pro tempore.
He could assign plum committee assignments to his cronies.
He could craft a House leadership more beholden to Donald Trump than to the voters.
That’s even more disturbing when considering that if a Biden-Trump election were held today, Trump would likely win.
House Speaker Donald Trump?Democrats should make MAGA dreams come true.
If the House remained in GOP control – a big if – then the system of checks and balances would crumble because the House would do Trump’s bidding, a frightening prospect because the revenge-seeking former president has vowed to go after his perceived enemies.
Americans can’t stand politics, as polls show voters have little regard for politicians or the government. And less than half of U.S. adults (47%) could name all three branches of government, the Annenberg Public Policy Center reported last year.
If you don’t understand the basics, how do you understand even slightly more complex topics that have a big impact on how government works? How can you understand that the U.S. House speaker is a big deal? 
Fortunately, the caucus beat back an effort to name Jordan speaker and defeated his “MAGA-see, MAGA-do” compatriots. That’s not much of a surprise given the immediate objection to this candidacy.
Despite Jordan’s contention that he could unite the party, he and his supporters are treating the speaker election like a boxing match, seeking to pummel his opponents into submission.
Congress is a mess:Sure, GOP Rep. George Santos is bad news. But Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez is much worse.
They took to the airwaves to pressure Republicans to vote for him, a tactic one of his allies, Rep. Dan Crenshaw , R-Texas, called “the dumbest way to support Jordan.”
But another supporter, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., tweeted, “You guys want to go 15 rounds? Fine. Let’s do it. On the floor. ... You want to explain to your voters why you blocked Jordan? Then bring it.”
It’s one thing to be a firebrand who loves to cause havoc. Have at it.
It’s another to control the House and be second in line to the presidency.
The Republicans have gotten it right.
Let's hope they continue to say, "Hell no."
Ray Marcano is a longtime journalist with writing and editing experience at some of the country’s largest media brands, including The Columbus Dispatch, where this column first published.
In excerpts of her upcoming memoir, shared by People, Britney Spears wrote that she became pregnant with Justin Timberlake’s baby and had an abortion because he wasn’t ready to become a father. 
“Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young,” Spears writes in her book, according to People. "If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father."
“To this day,” Spears continues, “it’s one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life."
Spears’ statements underscore the benefits that male partners receive from having access to abortion care — an often overlooked aspect of reproductive health in light of Roe v. Wade’s downfall last year that, if ignored in society and politics alike, perpetuates the idea that abortion is solely a women’s issue.
“Abortion is a highly stigmatized form of healthcare, and women almost always bear the brunt of the stigma and shame around abortion,” said Bethany Everett, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Utah. “Yet, there are likely many people, including male partners, who don’t want to become parents or have another child, who also benefit from abortion access — benefits that are rarely recognized by the broader public or policy makers.”
Everett, who studies the social and political implications of reproductive health, said Spears' claim that Timberlake did not want to become a parent suggests he was aware that a child could “derail his career,” a reality that “men rarely publicly acknowledge” but is critical to recognize in a post-Roe world. 
(On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, leaving it up to states to determine its legality. Some states have since banned nearly all abortions, while others have passed legislation protecting abortion access.)
Timberlake has yet to publicly respond to Spears’ comments.
Andréa Becker, a medical sociologist and postdoctoral research fellow with the University of California San Francisco’s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health program, said this example is “consistent with the literature,” in that “men don’t necessarily have to come forward and tell their abortion stories if they don’t want to.”
This pattern is due in part to a lack of research analyzing how access to abortion impacts male partners, a shortfall that Becker said “reinforces the way we talk about birth control, condom use and pregnancy avoidance as a woman’s responsibility and issue.”
“We just forget about the sperm involved in creating a pregnancy,” Becker said. 
As a result, stigmas associated with abortion disproportionately impact women.
“Men are rarely acknowledged as beneficiaries from abortion access so it is much easier for them to avoid the stigma and shame around abortion if they don’t think it’s something that impacts them personally,” Everett said. 
Data show that 1 in 5 men in the U.S. have been involved in abortion, which researchers say is likely an undercount. It's estimated that about 1 in 4 women in the U.S. will have an abortion by age of 45, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
The total number of abortions in the U.S. is difficult to measure, but the most recent estimates from 2020 show that there were anywhere between 620,000 to 930,000, according to data from the CDC and Guttmacher Institute. (The number of abortions in the U.S. dropped immediately after the fall of Roe v. Wade.) 
Meanwhile, research has found that some men are hesitant to admit their involvement with abortion. In a 2022 study, men were less likely to disclose the fact they were involved in an abortion during face-to-face interviews compared to an online survey.
In one of the few studies to analyze how abortion impacts male partners, Everett found that men who impregnated someone as a teenager were more likely to pursue post-high school education and graduate from college when the pregnancy ended in abortion compared to those that ended in live birth.
More on maternal health care inequities:Inequities in maternal health care access are not new. They have deep roots in history.
“When men don’t speak up, the burden of having to make decisions about unplanned pregnancies and access to abortion falls exclusively on women — and that’s an equity issue,” said Dr. Brian Nguyen, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. Nguyen runs a research group called the EMERGE Lab that conducts studies aimed at ensuring men recognize their responsibility in women’s reproductive health and gender equity.
While questions still abound about what role male partners should have in the abortion landscape, it’s important to recognize the general lack of knowledge about abortion in the U.S., particularly among some men, Becker said. Consequently, research shows many policy decisions now in place threaten the lives of women and girls who would benefit from abortion care, especially for people of color, migrants, people with disabilities, and those living on low incomes or in rural areas.
"Men do have a place in advocating for reproductive rights,” Everett said. “They can donate to abortion funds and reproductive health care organizations, and, importantly, with the consent of their partners, acknowledge how abortion access has benefited them.”

Lisa Bowman had everything going for her − until she didn't.
The now 56-year-old was the global chief marketing officer for United Way. United Way, an education, economic mobility and health-focused nonprofit, recruited her.
What should've been a dream job spiraled into a nightmare: she alleged she was sexually harassed at work, and more than 20 former employees of the company said "sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation is commonplace," at the company, according to a 2021 HuffPost report. The nonprofit fired Bowman in January 2020, months after she reported the harassment. Multiple claims have been filed with the EEOC; United Way told USA TODAY it doesn't comment on matters of employment. The CEO of United Way resigned as the chaos swirled.
But Bowman didn't just lose her job. She lost much more.
"The loss of my job was really that loss of my identity," she says. "All of a sudden, I went from being Lisa Bowman, CMO of the world's largest nonprofit where anybody would take my call, people were beating down the door to talk to me, to all of a sudden just being Lisa Bowman, private citizen, with no identity, so to speak. And that was a really, really tough thing for me to navigate."

Bowman says her grief affected her as a woman: "When I talk about the grief over the loss of a job, I think for women, as we fight so hard sometimes to get to executive levels, and those C-suite positions, when we get there, that job becomes an integral part of our identity," she says. "And so we identify very closely with our role."
She attempted to push through her grief – a "fake it 'til you make it" mentality – the same way she dealt with it at 26 following the death of her mother.
"She never got to see certain things happen in my life. She wasn't there for a wedding, for example, or to see the career trajectory that I ended up with, which have largely been influenced by her," Bowman says. "And in some cases, this is kind of the same thing. I'm missing out on all of those things, because of this loss of a job. And that in and of itself – it's grief. Every time something happens, and I have a financial challenge, it brings it all back."
Bowman confided in friends and family in lieu of professional help. While none could relate to her quandary, they listened to her. Heard her cry.
She later poured those thoughts into a book – "Harasshole" – which, while therapeutic, made it that much harder for her to get a job. Bowman previously had a 15-year stint in executive-level marketing roles at UPS but now freelances.
"It's made it very, very difficult for me to find employment," she says. "I have candidly applied for over 1000 jobs. I've had people tell me that they would love to hire me and they can't, because they can't take a risk with me. I've had job offers rescinded when people have found out about this."
Another kind of grief: missed opportunities.
Bowman's grief is not more or less than any other type of grief. "There's a context to think about it, as sometimes we approach grief like it's a pie," Kessler says. "And it goes wrong if we think, Wait, wait, you're taking some of the pie on your job loss. But I need a lot of it because my spouse died. And that isn't how grief works."
Some might call Bowman's job loss "disenfranchised grief" – a loss not openly acknowledged, socially mourned or publicly supported, according to Loree Johnson, a licensed marriage and family therapist. It's grief felt on an individual level not necessarily seen by others.
Plus, "the emotions can be the same, regarding all kinds of loss," says Amy Morin, psychotherapist and the host of a podcast. "Someone who lost their job may feel sad, anxious, and a bit disoriented, which might be the same feelings someone experiences when they lose a friend or relative."

Today, Bowman's grief hasn't dissipated. It's morphed: "Similar to the loss of a person, the grief doesn't go away. It's just that you get used to carrying it. So it doesn't feel quite as heavy."
For those going through a similar crisis, Bowman offers these words of advice: "You have to realize that it's not your role that defines who you are. It's who you are that makes you you. It's your skills, it's your capabilities, it's the value you provide."

Catching a flight across the country or just having some trouble sleeping? Many people turn to melatonin supplements in these instances for extra help catching some Z’s.
While melatonin does not have huge risk factors tied to it, every supplement can bring side effects if too high of a dose is taken or if used instead of prescribed medicines, according to the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements. 
Whether you are using the supplement to avoid jet lag or fight insomnia, or just want to sleep better, these are the side effects of melatonin and what to watch out for.
Side effects from melatonin are rare, but there is more risk involved when taking higher doses, explained Dr. Hal Alpert, telemedicine consultant for Blue Sleep. Here are some of the side effects to be aware of:
If a person were to take much too high of a dosage, the following could occur, according to Alpert:

Additionally, melatonin can interact with other drugs, so it is important to know when to avoid melatonin depending on any other conditions, said Alpert.
“Melatonin can decrease the effectiveness of drugs for epilepsy and immune suppressive drugs,” said Alpert. “You should avoid using melatonin in pregnant women, breastfeeding women, seizure disorders [and] depression.”
Melatonin can sometimes either raise or lower your blood pressure and make bleeding more likely if you’re on blood thinners, according to Alpert.

Cue up “Hollaback Girl” by Gwen Stefani. (The radio version, of course.) 
“B-A-N-A-N-A-S.” 
The rhythm and energy of this song may match the excitement some feel for this beloved fruit. People around the globe go bananas, for, well, bananas. 
Most people are familiar with the sweet flavor and soft texture of the banana – but some may wonder about its nutritional value – like its upsides, its downsides, and if we can actually eat them every day. We connected with Kara Burnstine, MSRD, LDN, CDCES, Registered Nutritionist and Certified Diabetes Educator at Pritikin Longevity Center to find out everything you need to know about bananas. 
Although bananas have many benefits, there are three main nutritional benefits that we want to focus on. 
Are you getting enough potassium?Here's what to know about the mineral, how to get more
The main drawback of bananas is the sugar content. Even though it is natural, too much sugar can lead to issues, particularly if you’re a diabetic or if you have weight loss goals.
Burnstine explains, “All fruits are not created equal in terms of calories and sugar content. Although the sugar content in fruit is natural and preferred, bananas have a higher cost in terms of calories and sugar content than some other fruits, for example, berries."
She adds, “Those with digestive disorders may have trouble digesting the sugars in the banana and they can cause some GI distress. It's a good idea to eat the banana before it gets all spotted like a leopard. The more spotted, the more ripened the banana becomes and increases the sugar content of the banana.”
Burnstine says the short answer is: yes. However, she urges you to think about some of the caveats,
“Keep the portions small, have them with fibrous foods like vegetables, and/or pair them with a healthy protein or plant-based fat to increase satiety and dilute sugar concentration.” She gives some examples of what she does at her practice, “Some great pairings would be Greek yogurt with a banana or a handful of nuts with a banana.” 
Additionally, the American Heart Association recommends, “Don’t go bananas. But maybe eat one.” They concurred that bananas have lots of wonderful nutrients, but that some people need to worry about the sugar or potassium content, particularly if you have kidney or heart disease.

LOS ANGELES – Call it a Tay-quake. A seismic ground shift that will overtake movie theaters on Thursday, but first trembled Wednesday night, when Taylor Swift's "The Eras Tour" concert film made its world premiere.
The movie, which the savvy Swift innovated primarily as a way for fans who couldn’t experience her colossal – and equally impressive – Eras Tour, received a debut befitting the comely superstar, whose every footstep seems to require breathless attention.
At the AMC Grove 14 in LA, about 2,200 people – a mix of fans, celebrities including Adam Sandler and Maren Morris, and entertainment industry insiders – filled every theater inside the complex. The surrounding ritzy outdoor shopping mall was closed for the day to allow for the setup and to better patrol ticketless Swifties yearning for a glimpse of their (decidedly not anti) hero.
More:Watching the world premiere of 'Eras Tour' movie with Taylor Swift felt like a dance party
After popping in to visit invited moviegoers in 13 of the theaters, Swift arrived at the one offering Dolby sound – the most effective presentation of this faithful-to-the-live-show movie – with a casual, "Hi, guys."
Swift stood at the front of the theater for a few minutes to express how much fun she's had performing during her Eras Tour and praised her backup singers and dancers, several of whom sat alongside her, pumping fists and singing along as the film unfolded.
"We pranced on that stage grinning because of what met us on the other side," Swift said. "You are main characters in this film. You cared so much about these shows."
Fans enthralled by the Eras concert will undoubtedly thrill at the opportunity to relive the magic and enjoy "The Eras Tour" as a communal concert experience more than a staid movie.

At just under three hours, the celluloid version of Swift's live spectacle is about 30 minutes shorter than her in-person performances throughout her six-month U.S. tour (her overseas dates kick off in November).
Her live shows offered an incredibly fulfilling set list of 45 songs – once she added "Long Live" to the rundown in July – and the film, directed by Sam Wrench, shaves off only a handful of tunes for a more efficient run time.
The songs that didn’t make the cut: "The Archer," "No Body, No Crime," "Long Live," "Illicit Affairs," "Cardigan" and "Wildest Dreams."
The concert footage comes from Swift's final U.S. shows of 2023 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California – she played an astounding six nights at the 70,000-capacity venue – and the film pulls from her Aug. 4 and Aug. 5 dates for her customary "surprise" songs.
Swift opted for "Our Song" to "thank the people who liked me when I was a little teenager writing songs for my ninth-grade talent show," she says on stage in the film.
After leading a crowd singalong of the sweet acoustic strummer, Swift takes her place behind the piano for "You're On Your Own, Kid," from her "Midnights" album.
The entire film offers a front-row seat to the grandeur. The staging is so massive that even the best seats in a stadium – and the King Kong-sized video screens – could provide only so much detail.
But on the big screen, the close-ups are glorious, whether zooming in on Swift's cat-eye makeup outlining her crystal blue eyes, the moss covering her piano and the sweat sticking to her bangs during "Champagne Problems" and her meticulous table setting at the start of "Tolerate It."
Among the performances, "Look What You Made Me Do" sizzles. The detailed shots of the various Swift incarnations in glass cases spotlight the intricacy of the number, while Swift is in her snarling, sexy glory as the camera whirls around her.
"Blank Space" – already one of the meatiest songs in her extensive catalog – also receives a boost from Swift's uncanny ability to find the camera for a coy wink and to unleash her long-legged strut.
Theaters will set their own rules, but the general consensus is that fans are encouraged to have fun, just not at the expense of fellow moviegoers.
At the premiere, it was difficult to tell the screams from the crowd on film from the cheers in the audience, and throughout, several fans stood to sing and dance along. By the time the show-closing "Karma" rolled out, the atmosphere felt like the encore at a concert, a joyful encounter full of love that indicated Swift isn't the only one having a blast at her shows.

Jon Bon Jovi’s blaze of glory will burn bright when the veteran rocker is honored as the 2024 MusiCares Person of the Year.
The 33rd annual benefit and tribute concert will take place at the Los Angeles Convention Center Feb. 2, two nights before the 66th annual Grammy Awards at the Crypto.com Arena. The list of performers who will fete Bon Jovi will be announced closer to the event.
In addition to founding and fronting one of the most successful rock bands in history, the New Jersey native and Grammy Award winner has long engaged in philanthropic efforts. In 2006 he established the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation, which provides food, affordable housing and job training programs to those affected by hunger, poverty and homelessness.

“Philanthropic work has been a cornerstone of my life and has always run in tandem to my music career and achievements. Nearly two decades ago when I formed the JBJ Soul Foundation and JBJ Soul Kitchens, I saw firsthand and continue to see today the impact of charitable community-based work. I know this for sure: helping one’s community is helping one’s self,” Bon Jovi said in a statement.
MusiCares is the foundation arm of the Recording Academy, which produces the Grammys, that provides aid, including emergency financial assistance, medical expenses, addiction recovery, disaster relief and treatment for critical illnesses to members of the music community.
Laura Segura, executive director of MusiCares, praised Bon Jovi’s musical and philanthropic work that “has made a difference in this world.”
“His remarkable contributions to rock ‘n’ roll have not only left an indelible mark on the music industry, but also in the hearts of countless fans around the world. Furthermore, his long-standing commitment to serving food-insecure and unhoused individuals inspires us all. We’re looking forward to celebrating him,” Segura said in a statement.
Bon Jovi joins an illustrious group of artists who have been celebrated by MusiCares, including Dolly Parton, Joni Mitchell, Fleetwood Mac and last year’s honorees, the duo of Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A multimillion-dollar conspiracy trial that stretched across the worlds of politics and entertainment is now touching on the tech world with arguments that a defense attorney for a Fugees rapper bungled closing arguments by using an artificial intelligence program.
Prakazrel "Pras" Michel, 51, argued that the use of the "experimental" generative AI program was one of a number of errors made by his "unqualified, unprepared and ineffectual" trial attorney before his conviction earlier this year, according to a motion for new trial his new lawyers filed this week. The company behind the program, on the other hand, said it was a tool used to help write closing statements, and a harbinger of major changes in the field.
Generative AI programs are capable of creating realistic text, images and video. They're raising tough questions about misinformation and copyright protections as well as industry calls for regulations in Congress. Programs like ChatGPT have already had ripple effects across professions like writing and education. The arguments in the Michel case could preview issues to come as the technology makes a rapid advance.
The Grammy-winning rapper's trial was touted as the first time generative AI was used in a federal trial in a news release from the startup company that designed the system. Defense attorney David Kenner, well known for his previous representation of rappers like Suge Knight and Snoop Dogg, also gave a quote calling the system a "game changer for complex litigation."
But in his last words to the jury, Kenner appeared to mix up key elements of the case and misattributed the lyric "Every single day, every time I pray, I will be missing you," to the Fugees, the 1990s hip-hop group his client co-founded, when actually it is a well-known line from a song by the rapper Diddy, then known as Puff Daddy, court documents from Michel's new attorney, Peter Zeidenberg, stated.
Kenner did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment from The Associated Press. The company, EyeLevel.AI, said the program wasn't "experimental" but instead trained using only facts from the case, including court transcripts, not musical lyrics or anything found online. It's intended to provide fast answers to complex questions to help, not replace, human lawyers, said co-founder and COO Neil Katz.
"We think AI technology is gong to completely revolutionize the legal field by making it faster and cheaper to get complex answers to legal questions and research," Katz said.
He denied an allegation from Michel's new lawyers that Kenner appeared to have a financial interest in the program.
The case will likely be closely watched as more law firms adopt the technology, said Sharon Nelson, president of Sensei Enterprises, a digital forensics, cybersecurity and information technology firm. A substantial number of firms are using it now, and surveys indicate more than 50% of lawyers expect to within the next year, she said. "It's gone much faster than we thought," she said. "The problem is, if you don't work with it, you're going to be left behind."
Michel was found guilty in April on all 10 counts he was charged with, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. He faces up to 20 years in prison on the top counts. He is free ahead of sentencing, which has not yet been set.
"At bottom, the AI program failed Kenner, and Kenner failed Michel. The closing argument was deficient, unhelpful, and a missed opportunity that prejudiced the defense," wrote Zeidenberg. His other arguments for a new trial included the jury being prejudiced by being allowed to hear references to the "crime fraud exception" and "co-conspirators."
Michel was accused of funneling money from a now-fugitive Malaysian financer through straw donors to Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign, then trying to squelch a Justice Department investigation and influence an extradition case on behalf of China under the Trump administration. His trial included testimony ranging from actor Leonardo DiCaprio to former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Kenner had argued during the trial the Grammy-winning rapper simply wanted to make money and got bad legal advice as he reinvented himself in the world of politics.
It wasn't immediately clear when a judge might rule on the motion for a new trial.
Use of generative AI in the legal profession is in the early stages, but it could see much more widespread adoption as products improve, said John Villasenor, a professor of engineering and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles. The American Bar Association does not yet have any guidelines on the use of AI in the legal profession, though there is a new task force studying the issue, a spokeswoman said.
Using it for closing arguments is complicated because of the many factors that develop over the course of a trial, he said. Generative AI, meanwhile, also sometimes produces "hallucinations," statements that initially read as if they are accurate but are not.
"A good attorney coming up with closing arguments will be mindful of basic goals of the case but also of the specific ways in which the trial has played out," he said. Even as products improve, "attorneys that use AI should make sure they very carefully fact check anything they are going to use."

“Dicks: The Musical” (in theaters nationwide Friday) is a polarizing, saucy and R-rated spin on “The Parent Trap” with F-bombs galore. It's "offensive, but also absurd and broad and silly,” says Josh Sharp, who writes and co-stars with Aaron Jackson. “Movies like this don't get made anymore."
Director Larry Charles’ musical comedy centers on Craig (Sharp) and Trevor (Jackson), two macho vacuum-parts salesmen who learn they’re long-lost brothers and seek to reunite their divorced parents, adventurously gay Harris (Nathan Lane) and tchotchke-collecting oddball Evelyn (Megan Mullally). Rapper Megan Thee Stallion plays Gloria, the guys' money-loving manager, and “Saturday Night Live” regular Bowen Yang plays the narrator, God himself, who plans to include what Sharp calls “this insane story” in the Bible. “It's just sort of the dumbest thing we could do.”
Are you prepared for “Dicks”? Here’s what to expect from the year’s most bizarre musical:
Sharp and Jackson’s original two-man, 30-minute, way-off-Broadway show was born at Manhattan’s Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in the 2010s. Back then, “the stakes were low,” Sharp says. "It really felt like we were (messing) around and nobody was watching.” Yang adds that he saw it “multiple times" and the show "became this touch point for a lot of queer comedians in the city.”
Jackson says they lost money on the show but by turning it into a movie – a much bigger lift – “we did get paid.” Sharp jokes: “I bought a boat for each of my six beautiful daughters.”
Bowen’s God is an omniscient narrator who ultimately becomes a part of the story, has several "fabulous" costume changes and is part of the big finale. “He’s just kind of observing, going 'That was fierce. Let's keep going,’” Yang says. Seeking an addendum to the Bible is “such a clever, simple, elegant way to make his presence have some stake to it.”
Yang definitely had a different take on the role, in contrast to actors like Morgan Freeman and Alanis Morissette. “There's an interpretation of God that people are afraid to sort of externalize, where he is this petty, messy deity," Yang says. "If he doesn't like something, then he'll flood the Earth or make it rain frogs, these really campy, gay things. And so, of course, he's this petulant gay guy in hot pants."
Bowen Yang on 'SNL':'Fuel up, do more' to fight racism against Asian Americans
Everything from “The Rocky Horror Show” and “Book of Mormon” to old Gene Kelly musicals were influences. But Jackson looked to “Gremlins,” “The Dark Crystal” and “those ‘80s movies with very handheld, tactile, nasty little creatures” as inspirations for the Sewer Boys, Harris' little live-in beasties. That brought a throwaway joke in the original show to diaper-clad life in the film.
Sharp recalls when Lane first read in the script that their names were, inexplicably, Backpack and Whisper, he laughed for five minutes straight at the absurdity. “If you think that's funny, this film is for you. And if you don't, it's not for you,” Sharp says. “Go home and watch 12 hours of ‘Blue Bloods.’”
The conversation gets rowdy when awards season comes up: “Best actress for me and Aaron?” Sharp asks. “Do the Oscars still do Best Gay Guy Comedy Duo?” Yet “Dicks” has a legitimate shot at the best original song with its catchy, often ribald show tunes. Sharp wouldn’t mind seeing a nomination for Lane and Mullally’s heartfelt ballad “Lonely,” “which was a joke to us that in the middle of this gonzo film, you'd sort of have three minutes where you're like, ‘Oh my God, I sort of care for these people.’”
But we're all for potentially seeing Megan Thee Stallion strut and twerk at the Oscars doing her movie showstopper, “Out-Alpha the Alpha.” “She was very down to clown,” Sharp adds. “She came in the first day when we met her and she was like, ‘You know, people know I'm dirty, but y'all are dirty.’ ”
As "Dicks" goes wide, chances are conservatives and religious folk won't love the lyrics of the finale number "All Love Is Love" – especially with the use of a certain gay slur in the chorus. What Jackson's more interested in is "if it will make $1 or $2 billion," he says with a laugh.
"Honestly, in making this movie, we're only thinking about the people who get it and not the people who wouldn't," Sharp adds. "It's nice that you can find your tribe of comedy weirdos and queer people and outrageous people and fans of musicals and people drawn to the audacious.
"There's so many movies that are even wildly popular that are no one's favorite movie. So the idea that we could make someone's favorite movie is fun."

The Week 8 slate in college football features four Top 25 showdowns for our panel of experts to consider. The Saturday headliner features No. 3 Ohio State hosting No. 6 Penn State in a highly anticipated contest with Big Ten and national championship implications.
Three of the other major conferences feature key games as well. A share of the lead in the ACC is on the line as No. 4 Florida State hosts No. 17 Duke. Yes, Duke. In the Pac-12, No. 14 Utah visits No. 16 Southern California, a must win for both teams hoping to keep their slim College Football Playoff hopes alive. There's also the measure of the Trojans trying to get revenge for two losses to the Utes last season.
Speaking of revenge, there's a big one in the SEC as No. 8 Alabama hosts No. 15 Tennessee. The Crimson Tide lost one to the Volunteers in Knoxville. This season, both teams already have a lost, making this a College Football Playoff eliminator.
Our staff weighs in on those key clashes, while also looking for potential upsets among the rest of the Top 25.
The Phoenix Mercury’s leadership could have just had T-shirts made up with a middle finger on the front. The effect would have been the same.
A team that has Diana Taurasi and Brittney Griner, two of the greatest players in the history of the game, and that’s won three WNBA titles and played for two more, is now being coached by a journeyman NBA assistant with zero experience in the women’s game. Not as a WNBA assistant, not at the college level, not even for funsies at the local junior high.
But Nate Tibbetts is a “Girl Dad” everybody, so that makes it all OK!
Not content with the skewering they were getting on social media following the leak of Tibbetts’ hiring, the Mercury decided to go full dumpster fire and confirm the news with a cringe-worthy post. Less than an hour before Game 4 of the WNBA Finals tipped off, no less. If new Mercury owner Mat Ishbia and Nick U’Ren really have this dim a view of their team, and the women’s game in general, they should do everyone a favor and put the team up for sale. Now.
It shouldn't be that hard to treat women as equals to men rather than objects to be patronized or, the other default, pitied. Yet here we are. Again.  
What’s particularly disheartening about Ishbia and U’Ren’s moves, aside from (waves hand in the air) everything, is they arrived in Phoenix with such promise. Earlier this month, Ishbia said he would invest more than $100 million in a state-of-the-art practice facility for the Mercury and adjoining headquarters for them and the Suns. 
"We're going to do it right, and we're going to do it fast," Ishbia said. 
This, however, is as far from right as it gets. 
It’s possible Tibbetts will end up being a terrific coach. He’s apparently well thought of in the NBA, though not enough to get a head coaching job. But he doesn’t know the women’s game, and it’s an insult to everyone to suggest that doesn’t matter.
Basketball is basketball, but there are different rules between the WNBA and the NBA. Tibbetts also has no familiarity with the personnel, on his team or any other. As a coach, he’s got no experience with the different challenges the women’s game will present. Challenges like pregnancies. Child care. Injuries that are more likely to occur in women athletes than men. 
If there was no one else out there who was qualified, the Mercury’s move could be understood. Accepted even. But there are plenty who are, and anyone who cares about the game could easily have given Ishbia and U’Ren a list. 
Instead, they looked around and decided a guy with no experience was better than a woman with years of it, for no other reason, apparently, than Tibbetts is a guy. 
"We need more male advocates and more women leaders who do the hiring," former Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said on X. "Women are judged on their success, men on their potential. It’s time we started believing in the potential of women." 
For decades, women’s sports have been run by men who thought they were doing the girls some big favor by giving them a place to play. First-class facilities, professional support staff and savvy marketing campaigns – what would women need with that? A pat on the head will suffice! 
Thankfully, most people have woken up to the fact that these are world-class athletes, every bit the professionals as LeBron James and Stephen Curry. And the smartest owners have realized there’s a boatload of money to be made, if only you treat your women’s team the way you would your men’s. 
It’s no coincidence the teams in the WNBA Finals were Las Vegas Aces and the New York Liberty. Aces owner Mark Davis and Liberty owners Joe and Clara Wu Tsai have poured money into their teams, building dazzling practice facilities and, you guessed it! Hiring the best coaches. 
All Becky Hammon has done in her first two years in Las Vegas was bring Davis back-to-back championships. 
Men can coach in the WNBA. Plenty do. As McGraw pointed out, 50-plus years after Title IX, more than 60% of women’s teams are coached by men. 
But it has to be the right man. Not some guy whose main qualification seems to be that he’s a "Girl Dad."

The “deepest, darkest thoughts’’ of Katie Meyer may be relevant in the wrongful death lawsuit her parents filed against Stanford University, a California judge wrote in an order submitted with the Santa Clara County Superior Court.
The Sept. 28 order compels Meyer’s parents, Steve and Gina, to produce a "mirror drive'' containing potentially sensitive information from Katie Meyer's laptop. It also underscores how things have evolved since the former Stanford soccer goalkeeper died by suicide more than a year and a half ago.
On Thursday night, she will be remembered publicly again at Stanford’s campus in California, where she was a captain of the women’s soccer team when she took her life.
A year ago, Stanford bought airline tickets for Meyer's parents so they could fly in from their home in Southern California for the soccer team's mental health awareness match, when their daughter was honored. They have no plans to attend this year's event.
"We were not contacted by Stanford about the game — however, we are heartened to see that since Katie’s tragic passing, there appear to be steps taken by the university to provide mental health and well-being resources for their students, as they are the caretakers of our young people during their lives on campus,'' Gina and Steve Meyer said in a statement provided to USA TODAY. "We have, and always will be, fully supporting the Stanford Women's Soccer Program and the amazing young women of that team.''
Neither lawyers representing Stanford in the matter nor Dee Mostofi, Stanford's assistant vice president for external communications, responded to USA TODAY's requests for comment made by email and phone.
The litigation between the Meyers and Stanford has grown increasingly combative, as reflected by court filings. Both parties, in assigning responsibility for Meyer’s death, have accused the other of breaching duty of care.
Key evidence about why Meyer took her life at 22, just months before she was set to graduate, could be found on the mirror drive of Meyer’s laptop, according to court records.
Meyer’s laptop is relevant because of what her parents say it proves, according to court filings.
Their assertions center around disciplinary action Stanford took against Meyer in 2022, according to court filings. School officials determined Meyer may have acted in retaliation when she spilled coffee on a Stanford football player in 2021.
The unnamed player, who suffered burns on his back that required medical attention, had kissed one of Meyer’s teammates without consent a week earlier, according to the school’s records filed with the court.
On Feb. 28, 2022, the night before Meyer’s body was found in her dorm room, she received an email from Stanford informing her that she was facing a disciplinary charge stemming from the spilled coffee. According to a court filing, a five-page letter sent by email explained her degree was going to be placed on hold less than four months from graduation and the charge could result in her removal from the university.
“Computer forensics shows that Katie frantically toggled back and forth between the letter and the attachments and searching how to defend a disciplinary complaint,’’ according to a court document that noted Stanford's Counseling and Psychiatric Services were closed when Meyer received the email to which she replied she was "shocked and distraught."
“The actions of Stanford and its employees in charging Katie with a violation of fundamental standards over spilling coffee on a Football Player perpetrator of sexual assault without sufficient evidence was reckless, and wrongful and resulted in an acute stress reaction and her impulsive suicide.''
Stanford said the unnamed soccer player who was kissed by the football player without consent did not take the necessary steps to initiate a formal investigation, according to court records.
The school objected after months of delays following the Meyers agreeing to provide the mirror drive. It led to the Sept. 28 order from Judge Frederick Chung of the Superior Court of Santa Clara that the Meyers produce the mirror drive in 30 days.
The Meyers agreed March 10 in responses verified under oath to produce the mirror drive but, according to the judge's order, "then backtracked.''
The Meyers later argued they never agreed to provide an "absolute mirror image of the decedent's computer'' and only "responsive,'' "non-privileged information," according to the order. The judge wrote that argument is "baseless."
“In addition,’’ the judge wrote, “the court finds that a mirror image of Katie Meyer's laptop is directly relevant to the central issues in this case, including Katie's state of mind and her activities on her computer.’’
Meyer's parents say she reported suffering from depression and suicidal ideation at the time she was going through the disciplinary proceeding. According to Meyer's parents, Stanford's handling of the disciplinary process led to Meyer's suicide.
Stanford, in response to the Meyers' complaint, introduced evidence it argues shows Meyer’s parents contributed to her suicide.
In February 2022, six days before Meyer was found dead, she rehearsed in front of teachers an oral presentation she would make to the class about her family relationships before she came to Stanford, according to a court filing.
“The notes taken of what Katie said reveal Katie’s struggles with her parents and their control and pressure to be perfect,’’ Stanford’s attorneys wrote.
Meyer made statements about her mental state during a period that ended before she enrolled at Stanford, according to the school’s filing.
This was cited as part of the school’s contention that Meyer’s parents "breached...duty of care."
Attorney Kim Dougherty, who is representing Meyer's parents, told USA TODAY by email, "While elite athletes and devoted students always endure stress related to their goals, nothing caused Katie to take her life until the night she received the 5 page punitive letter threatening everything she worked so hard for and her entire future."
A suicide note was recovered from the scene, according to the autopsy report, which provides no additional information about the note.
A filing from the Meyers states, “The letter from (Office of Community Standards) was open on Katie’s computer screen at the time of her death."
But a court filing from Stanford stated the suicide note “did not mention the (disciplinary) proceeding or anything related to it.’’
According to the autopsy report, Meyer had been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The report, which cites a medical record review, does not say when Meyer was diagnosed.
At Stanford, she was prescribed Concerta, an ADHD medicine she had been taking since May 2021 to help with issues of concentration, according to a court filing. But she "had issues'' refilling the prescription because of insurance and after November 2021 was unable to get the medicine prescribed again, according to the filing.
The filing states that a sports psychologist and sports psychiatrist at Stanford failed to properly monitor Meyer's refills even though they knew suicidal ideations may be present for months after discontinuation of the medicine. No drugs were found in her body at the time of her death, according to the toxicology report.
In addressing the relevance of the mirror drive, Judge Chung wrote of Meyer’s mental health and mental state, “Those issues have been pushed to the forefront by the Meyers' own allegations…and so the uncomfortable reality is that much of Katie's private life — including her deepest, darkest thoughts — may be potentially relevant to this case.’’
Dougherty, the attorney representing Meyer's parents, said they are prepared to comply with Judge Chung’s deadline to produce the mirror drive by the end of this month.
On Tuesday, as Stanford was preparing for the women’s soccer team’s mental health awareness match, Dougherty said she has been working on an amendment to protect third-party rights in the release of the mirror drive.
"So if there’s friends of (Meyer's) or boyfriends or things like that where they’re talking about their own private information, that’s the area that obviously we want to protect and ensure is protected as required under California law,'' Dougherty said. “That’s what we’re negotiating on with Stanford right now. We are not seeking to hide anything as it relates to the Meyers or Katie. We have nothing to hide.''
There is no information on the setting of a trial date, according to Jessica Kellogg, communications program manager for the Superior Court of Santa Clara County. 
On Thursday night, when Stanford plays Oregon State, Meyer will be recognized in a variety of ways, according to the school.
Stanford’s players will wear T-shirts that bear the slogan “Katie’s Save,’’ a nod to the initiative of Meyer’s parents to require colleges to give students the option to select a designated advocate. They argue it would have saved their daughter.
As they have all season, Stanford players will wear jerseys with a butterfly patch in honor of Meyer. She loved butterflies.

A fire broke out on an American Queen Voyages cruise ship Wednesday morning in Portland, Maine, injuring one crew member.
Portland Fire Department crews arrived at 14 Ocean Gateway Pier shortly before 7:30 a.m. local time and received reports of an explosion in the Ocean Navigator vessel’s engine room, possibly related to a generator, according to a news release. The ship was carrying 128 passengers and 82 crew members.
“PFD crews worked quickly to treat and transport one crew member with serious injuries to a local hospital,” the department said. “Additional crews were simultaneously able to stabilize the engine room issue and remained on scene to assist with extensive ventilation efforts and complete overhaul to prevent any further issues.”
Cruise ship medical evacuations:Here's what to know
An American Queen Voyages spokesperson said the ship had a generator fire, but passengers were unharmed “and thanks to the quick action of our crew, everyone has been safely evacuated off of the vessel.” Guests are being housed in a hotel.
The sailing began in Montreal on Oct. 10, according to CruiseMapper.

Travelers on a recent easyJet flight had to endure every passenger’s worst nightmare when the already delayed flight was canceled after a passenger allegedly defecated on the floor. 
Flight EZY8054 departing from the Spanish island of Tenerife to London Gatwick on Sunday was initially delayed because the plane was overweight and luggage had to be offloaded to the next available flight, Paula Peralta, a spokesperson for the budget airline, told USA TODAY in a statement. 
“The flight was subsequently delayed overnight due to the aircraft requiring additional cleaning,” Peralta added. 
One passenger shared the moment it was announced the flight was canceled until the next day in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter. “(Unintelligible) defecated in the front toilet,” the crew member said in the clip. “So we’re now staying the night here.” 
In the caption of the video, the poster tagged the airline and wrote that the flight was canceled “because someone took a (expletive) on the toilet floor.”

Aaran Gedhu was another passenger on the flight and told CNN that people were already upset and “tense” from the initial delay. The pilot had just announced the flight was cleared to take off in 20 minutes when the defecation incident occurred. 
While the plane was grounded for about an hour, he saw two passengers go to the restroom at the front of the plane. 
Shortly after, a rumor spread in the cabin that someone had defecated on the restroom floor. Gedhu said a bad smell followed. 
“It was just a very uncomfortable experience,” he told CNN, but it was likely an “accident.”
Passengers were given hotel accommodations and another flight was scheduled for the next day.  
“The safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew is easyJet’s highest priority and while this was outside of our control we would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience caused,” Peralta said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agriculture Specialists at the Chicago O’Hare International Airport were faced with an unlikely situation after they discovered 15 pounds of raw goat viscera in the baggage of two passengers.
The incident happened on last Tuesday Oct. 10th.
The agency, in a news release, said that two passengers, who were arriving from the Democratic Republic of Congo, were referred to agriculture secondary for inspection.
"CBPAS inspected their baggage and found one pound of unknown meat, 2 pounds of garden eggs, and 15 pounds of raw goat viscera including the trachea, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and entire digestive system," said the news release.
A photo provided by the agency shows the internal organs of the goat as an officer holds up the body parts.
"An eviscerated goat is certainly outside of the normal items they [CBPAS] stop," said the new release about the items.

The news release said that agriculture specialists seized the prohibited items and destroyed them to prevent livestock diseases and plant pests from entering the country.
“There are real dangers these items can have if they are introduced in the U.S. economy,” said CBP Director LaFonda D. Sutton-Burke with the Field Operations-Chicago Field Office.
She urged all passengers, whether entering or returning to the U.S., to be truthful about their baggage and declare all items they are bringing.
"If one prohibited item enters the U.S. it could have dangerous ecological or economical results," emphasized Sutton-Burke.

Mosquitoes on a plane:Video shows insects swarm airplane, delay takeoff in Mexico
UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay.
Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports.
Their partnership should have been a force for good. Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.
The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.
Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.
But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.
According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.
“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”
In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”
“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”
Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.
The stakes are high for everyone.
Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.
Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.
Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.
Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.
“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”
USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.
Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.
For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.
Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.
For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.
“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”
Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.
Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.
At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.
By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.
Tucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.
Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline
Tucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.
Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.
Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.
Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.
During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.
They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.
In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”
It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.
Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.
Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.
They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.
Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.
By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.
Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.
Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”
Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.
Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.
Twelve days later came the call.
Tracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.
According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.
“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”
Tracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”
She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.
“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”
Tracy said she thought to herself, "Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it." In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”
When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.
Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.
Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.
At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.
Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.
When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.
Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.
Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”
Tucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.
The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.
Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.
She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.
Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.
“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”
The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.
A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.
Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.
Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.
Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.
Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.
Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.
“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.
Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.
Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.
Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.
Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.
They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.
“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”
Michigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.
The case would go forward.
Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22.
He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.
For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.
Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.
An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.
Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.
During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”
Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.
“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”
Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.
Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.
Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.
Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.
At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.
Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.
Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”
Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.
One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.
A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”
“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”

On a sunny Thursday morning, Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker strolled through tomato fields at a farm in Immokalee, Florida, toured its processing plants and loaded baskets of bright green fruit into a truck. 
It was a private event thrown by the school to promote its migrant student services program, which provides financial aid and support to farmworkers seeking college degrees. After the April 28, 2022, tour, disclosed in records obtained by USA TODAY this week, Tucker met with community leaders and alumni.
That night, Tucker would make the now-infamous phone call from his hotel room in nearby Naples, during which he is accused of masturbating and making unwanted sexual comments to Brenda Tracy, a prominent rape survivor and activist he had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence.
Yet, when Tucker met with the university’s outside investigator in March for his interview in the sexual harassment case against him, he insisted the trip was not work-related – a claim the investigator would disprove in her report.
It’s just one example of Tucker failing to keep his story straight at the most consequential moment of his career. 
With his job, reputation and the roughly $80 million left on his contract at stake, Tucker repeatedly made false statements to the investigator and misled her about basic facts, such as his location during the phone call and the date it occurred, a USA TODAY review of more than 1,200 pages of case documents found. 
The investigator, Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, and the news organization both obtained documents and witness statements that discredit key aspects of Tucker’s version of events. 
Michigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sept. 10, hours after Tracy went public for the first time with her story in USA TODAY. On Monday, the school informed Tucker it plans to fire him for cause based on the conduct he had admitted to and the embarrassment he had caused the school. 
Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivor
Although Tucker denied sexually harassing Tracy, he acknowledged masturbating on the call, saying he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex.” Tracy said Tucker’s romantic interest in her was completely one-sided and that she had tried to set boundaries multiple times during their yearlong business partnership.
Per his contract, Tucker has until Tuesday to make a case for keeping his job. Regardless, a formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated school policies against sexual harassment and exploitation is expected to proceed on Oct. 5 and 6. 
Since his suspension, Tucker has issued multiple public statements defending himself, attacking Tracy and accusing Veidlinger of bias. He accused the school of conducting a “sham” hearing and having “ulterior motives.” Yet even in these written statements, the central details of his story changed entirely.
Tucker, who previously hung up on a reporter who called him on his cellphone asking about the case, did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. His attorney, Jennifer Belveal, has not responded to phone calls and emails. Tracy declined to comment for this story.
In the absence of eyewitnesses or recordings, sexual harassment cases usually boil down to whose account is more credible, said Elizabeth Abdnour, a Lansing-based attorney and former Michigan State Title IX investigator who has taken part in dozens of campus cases.
“It’s very, very unusual that you would have some outside piece of evidence that would give you a clear decision,” Abdnour said. “Very often you’re weighing credibility based on little bits and pieces of information.” 
In multiple cases she has worked, Abdnour said the respondents lost because they were found to have a greater propensity for lying than the complainants. The hearing officer must determine how much weight to give Tucker’s false and conflicting statements, Abdnour said, and they could sway the case in Tracy’s favor.
“I believe a fact finder could assess these pieces of evidence about credibility and make a determination that Brenda is more credible than Mel,” she said. “In my experience, a clear sign of a lack of credibility is generally taken very seriously.”
By the time Tucker met with Veidlinger for his interview, he had had months to prepare.
The school had informed him of Tracy’s complaint on Dec. 22, the day after she filed it. Veidlinger had interviewed Tracy and all six of her witnesses by the end of January. Tucker was the only holdout.
Rather than tell his side of the story right away, Tucker and his attorney spent three months trying to stop the investigation, case documents show. They wrote legal arguments urging Michigan State to drop the case and twice approached Tracy’s attorney proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no, and the school pressed forward.
On March 22, the day of his interview, Tucker sent Veidlinger a seven-page written account of his interactions with Tracy and lists of their “currently existing” text message and call history, which he said his legal team had compiled. Only a handful of text messages remained; he and Tracy both told the investigator they had deleted their texts with each other in the months after the April 2022 phone call.
In his interview, which lasted 3 ½ hours, Tucker questioned whether Tracy had mixed up the date of the call. He said he recalled being at his home in East Lansing when it occurred, but his own records showed that he had been in Florida on April 28, attending a charity function that was “absolutely not a University-sponsored event.”
His seven-page account told a different story – that he had called her while he was “alone in a hotel room.”
Veidlinger does not appear to have asked Tucker about the discrepancy, based on case documents. But by then she knew what he told her in the interview was untrue: she had already obtained records proving he had not been home in East Lansing.
An expense report he had submitted to the university for reimbursement of his hotel and meals shows Tucker flew to Naples, Florida, to attend a golf fundraiser hosted by The Greg H. Montgomery Jr. Foundation for Ultimate Growth, which raises awareness for suicide prevention. It showed he stayed at the Hilton from April 27 to 29, that the trip’s purpose was “administrative” and that it did not involve personal travel. He had flown there on a donor’s private plane.
The trip is when Tucker toured the farm in Immokalee to help promote Michigan State’s College Assistance Migrant Program. The event was titled “Working to make dreams a reality,” according to an agenda obtained from the university by USA TODAY through a public records request. The agenda features Tucker’s name prominently. Tucker posted photos from the tour on his Twitter account.
That Tucker was on a university-sponsored work trip during the incident was a contributing factor in the university’s determination that it had jurisdiction to investigate, the investigation report shows. 
Tucker’s lists of calls and text messages also were missing an important detail: They did not show any communication with Tracy on April 28. He acknowledged in the interview, however, that he had not reviewed the lists before submitting them and that they may have been incomplete.
Tracy, meanwhile, had already provided Veidlinger with her official cellphone records from Sprint that confirmed the date of their call: April 28.
Tucker and Tracy did not speak in the three months after the April 28 call.
Meanwhile, their assistants were planning Tracy’s third visit to campus – an in-person training with coaches and players scheduled for July 25.
Tucker canceled that training three days before, the investigation report shows. When Tracy spoke to him by phone on Aug. 2 seeking to find out why, she would tell the investigator in her interview that Tucker insinuated he would harm her career if she spoke about his conduct. He never rescheduled her visit, and they never spoke again.
The cancellation became a key focus of the investigator – one of a series of alleged incidents that taken together would meet the definition of sexual harassment, which can include pressuring someone into engaging in sexual behavior for an employment benefit and threatening that rejecting such behavior will carry a negative consequence.
“Reported allegations that a University employee is engaging in misconduct within the vendor-vendee relationship for which they are the decision-maker, and/or impeding in such a services relationship based on a quid-pro-quo sexual harassment allegation, is within a University sponsored program or activity,” Veidlinger wrote in the report, so school policy covered it.
Tucker tried to distance himself from the cancellation in a public statement on Sept. 11, the day after Michigan State suspended him without pay.
“I never cancelled any presentation,” he wrote. “Given a personnel change and scheduling challenges as football season approached, we merely postponed it until January 2023. She chose to file her complaint instead of proceeding with the training.”
But that statement contradicts what he told the investigator. When Veidlinger asked in his March interview if he had a role in canceling Tracy’s visit, Tucker said, “Yes, absolutely I did,” the report shows, and that he did not recall any discussions about rescheduling Tracy for January. Such timing would not make sense, he added, because most of his new players would not yet be on campus. 
Tucker also told the investigator why he canceled the visit, blaming it on a scheduling conflict. He said he had recently hired a mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, who needed to implement his new program on short notice. There was limited time in fall camp, Tucker said, and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” the players. He said he decided to yield the time to Newman.
Veidlinger, however, would later obtain records showing Newman did not meet with the team on July 25, the day of Tracy’s planned visit. He had been meeting with them weekly since June 6, the records showed but held no meetings between July 15 and July 28.
One of Tucker’s assistants, who is a witness in the case, also told the investigator that Tucker asked him via text message to cancel it. He said he was never instructed to reschedule. 
In his interview, Tucker told Veidlinger that his relationship with Tracy frayed after the April 2022 phone call – not because of the incident, but because of information he learned after that caused him not to trust her.
According to Tucker, an associate of his had told him over the summer that Tracy’s assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, had been gossiping about Tucker’s marriage, telling others it was “on the rocks.” Tucker said he was “devastated” because he had confided in Tracy about his marital problems, and he believed she had discussed them with Alvarado.
Tucker confronted Tracy about the alleged gossiping during the Aug. 2 phone call, they both told the investigator. Tracy said he berated and bullied her, repeatedly saying he could not trust her. She said she told him she did not know what he was talking about.
Alvarado – who was killed in a car crash in June – would deny discussing Tucker’s marriage with anyone in her January interview with Veidlinger. 
During the Aug. 2 call, Tracy said she pressed Tucker to identify his source – the associate. She told Veidlinger she believed Tucker had made it up as a pretext for canceling her visit and ending her relationship with the school.
Veidlinger also asked Tucker to reveal the source of his claim, but he refused to say. In her report, she wrote that he said he had “given (his) word that (he) wouldn’t divulge their name.” 
Tucker never revealed the associate’s name to the investigator, nor did he identify anyone who could support his version of events. In his Sept. 11 public statement, however, he lamented that the hearing would not afford him the opportunity to “offer any substantive evidence of innocence.”
It was not the only claim he attributed to his anonymous associate. In his interview, he said that same person told him that ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating how Tracy “goes about her business” by claiming to be a rape survivor.  
Tucker said this further caused him to believe Tracy was untrustworthy because she believed Lavigne was her friend but didn’t know she was investigating the rape story at the center of her public persona. 
It turned out to be yet another falsehood.
Reached by USA TODAY, Lavigne said in an emailed statement that she was “perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.” She said Tracy has been a source of information for her for several years, and that she has featured Tracy’s comments and advocacy work in multiple news stories.
“That has been the extent of my reporting on Tracy and her organization,” Lavigne wrote. “Neither the organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting.”
Asked who might have told Tucker this misinformation, Lavigne responded, “I have absolutely no idea who would have alleged this to anyone.”

The bullets came in plywood crates. 
Any given box was about the size of a small microwave oven. The printed label stuck to each one demonstrated a militaristic brevity. “CARTRIDGES FOR WEAPONS, INERT PROJECTILE,” next to a bright yellow hazmat sticker, “EXPLOSIVES.” 
Inside the boxes: drab green steel cans of .50-caliber ammunition. Each round was giant, more than 5 inches long, built to be fired from a gun so big it is typically bolted to a truck. The bullets were clipped together in long strands for rapid, machine-gun fire. 
By the time Bill Brown got to the boxes, they sat double-stacked eight high atop wooden pallets inside a Missouri warehouse. The pallets went on, row after row. Three million bullets in all. 
It was enough ammunition to feed a single machine gun – if fired nonstop at its rated speed eight hours a day, seven days a week – for almost six months. 
Brown’s job was to get it out of there and toward the Ukrainian front lines. The faster, the better. 
“War is bad,” Brown said. “Loss of life is bad. But at the end of the day, it’s very profitable and injects revenue into this military industrial base.”
There would be virtually no public record of this Ukrainian arms shipment. As a weapons dealer, Brown’s company would deliver the bullets under a system known as a direct commercial sale. The ammunition required a State Department signoff – but the secret deal would never appear in a White House announcement or the Congressional Record. 
Instead, it was part of a shadowy system of brokers, exporters, arms dealers and country-to-country transfers that has become one part of the race to meet demand on distant battlefields. 
Western weaponry fueled Ukraine’s summertime counteroffensive along a 600-mile front. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the effort was delayed in part by the wait for more arms. Amid concerns about that slowly progessing counteroffensive, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday with a promise of up to $175 million more in military equipment. 
Most of America’s $44 billion in documented support to Ukraine came in the form of old U.S. military stock, donated directly by the federal government. In general, commercial sales over $14 million, and sales of military-grade weaponry like mortars or missiles, require State Department approval and congressional notification.
But other aid comes via private sales. 
More than 14,000 U.S. entities are registered to conduct defense trade activities. Their deals are monitored by an alphabet soup of agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Trade secrecy clauses in federal law mean this flow of gear, weapons and ammunition is almost never revealed to the public.
Brown, who works for a small Nevada-based logistics company called Battle Born Munitions, provided USA TODAY with a rare look behind the curtain of these private sales. Details about the shipment were verified by his employer and the European government that made the purchase. State Department officials declined to answer questions about the specific shipment Brown described.
This March sale and the secret number of other shipments like it fuel Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion. Those sales also release an unknown amount of weaponry into the world. What becomes of that weaponry after it’s sold – and especially after it’s delivered – is difficult to track. 
As Brown surveyed the warehouse in Missouri, a crew steered forklifts and skid lifts among the stacks of plain wooden boxes. From high in the trusses, suspended lamp fixtures bathed the boxes in artificial daylight. Brown lifted his camera and started snapping photos. 
In just a few hours, he and his cargo would be boarding a jumbo jet. Three million bullets would climb to the stratosphere and hurtle across the north Atlantic toward a European dawn.
From Ukraine:War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented. So is the country's push for swift justice.
The bullets had once been bound for Saudi Arabia. 
Lot number SMQ19K401L026 had rolled off the assembly line in 2019 at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Kansas City. Lake City, owned by the government and run by a contractor, sprawls across nearly 4,000 acres of green Missouri farmland. Roads curve past World War II-era bunkers known as igloos, spaced out amid the countryside – far enough apart that an explosion in one won’t trigger a chain reaction in the others.
Lake City has been pumping out ammunition almost without pause since 1941. It is the largest small-arms manufacturing plant in the world.
Today the plant is run by Olin-Winchester, but in 2019, the bullets were made by some of the 1,700 workers employed by Northrop Grumman. And in 2019, Saudi Arabia was stocking up on weapons during the Trump administration, fueling the war in Yemen and other conflicts that drew criticism from congressional Democrats.
The plant manufactures .50-caliber ammunition on a rolling basis, for both military and commercial buyers. That’s a testament to just what a legend the bullet – and the gun that shoots it – has become.
In 2019, the technology was already a century old. The .50 caliber was the brainchild of American gunsmith John Browning during World War I. Built to respond to German anti-tank rifles, the M2 was first tested in 1918, and it entered widespread service in 1923. It earned the nickname “Ma Deuce” and has served in combat ever since, bolted to trucks, ships, planes and handheld stands on the battlefield.
The .50-caliber rounds – named for their diameter, about half an inch – can easily hit targets more than a mile away. At closer ranges, they will blast through solid concrete or armored vehicles. The gun can fire at a sustained rate of about 40 shots per minute.
Military setups use strings of “linked” ammunition to feed into machine guns. Spaced out after every fourth bullet, so-called tracer rounds have small pyrotechnic charges that illuminate the line of fire, aiding in targeting.
The gun’s longevity and versatility made it popular for militaries the world over. But this particular batch of bullets wouldn’t end up being sold to Saudi Arabia. 
The Biden administration put a temporary freeze on sales to the Saudi government in 2021 as it reviewed weapons deals approved under Donald Trump. Instead, Brown said, the bullets were sold to a U.S. ammunition provider, only to be held up again. Ultimately, they were mothballed. 
Then, in spring 2023, the bullets found a buyer, or actually two: first Battle Born; ultimately, the Netherlands. 
The European country, a NATO ally, needed a big supply of ammunition. It wouldn’t be keeping the bullets but giving them to Ukraine. Its purchase, essentially a donation, would count toward the country’s required NATO contribution. 
Brown had a line on exactly what they needed. It was sitting in the warehouse in Missouri. 
He arrived in March to personally oversee the shipment. As he prepped for delivery, Brown dropped tiny black tracking devices onto several of the pallets. Just $55 apiece, the units use GPS and cell signals to keep tabs on the load. The idea was to ensure it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands. 
But packing up the bullets was just the beginning. As with anything that’s deadly and made of metal, the shipping costs can be extreme. 
Brown said the question for the buyer was simple: “How fast do you want it? Forty-five to 60 days on a ship? Or in five days if I fly it?”
Brown – or Chief Bill, as he prefers – is a no-nonsense 35-year veteran of the U.S. Army and former helicopter pilot. He retired as a chief warrant officer and lives in Orlando. 
Now 59, he still spends a lot of time on the road – 10 international trips this year. He says his arms logistics work takes him to places most Americans would rather avoid – near the Syrian border or to unstable regions of Iraq.
He’ll travel halfway around the world, he quips, “have some soup, and go back to Warsaw to head home.” The trips aren’t really about the destinations. They’re about the cargo. 
On that spring day in Missouri, forklifts carefully loaded 107 pallets of the ammo onto 18 flatbed semitrailers. They’d all make the eight-hour drive to O’Hare International Airport. 
In Chicago, two Boeing 747-400s operated by National Airlines would be ready for the freight. 
Four pallets each were stacked and shrink-wrapped to create “air pallets” or “cookie sheets” weighing 12,800 pounds. Each plane could carry up to 17 of the pallets that ran the length of each plane secured by white cargo netting.
Flight records Brown provided show the two planes departed about seven hours apart, one in early afternoon, one after dark. 
The flight would take nine hours. Brown wasn’t going to the Netherlands, even though it was the buyer. The planes were bound for Rzeszów, Poland. 
The ancient city sits at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland. It has a gleaming modern airport next to a major east-west freeway. From there, it’s barely 60 miles to the border with Ukraine. 
It was an expensive journey. The trucking company’s bill for those 18 semis? $85,000. Chartering the two 747s? $625,000. Each.
But this shipment of .50-cal rounds was profitable for Battle Born Munitions, according to Brown.
The company purchased the 3 million rounds from Northrop Grumman at a bargain and resold them for more than double the price. (In subsequent interviews, representatives at BBM disputed the specific totals Brown mentioned, saying the accurate figures were protected by “various commercial and government non-disclosure agreements.” They did not dispute the other specifics of the deal he provided.) 
Retail prices for .50-caliber ammunition run roughly $5 per bullet. At that rate, the whole shipment would have been worth $15 million.
The pricing might also be elastic. The Dutch mark up the price of the bullets and count it toward their NATO contribution, pegged to a percentage of gross domestic product, Brown said. The Netherlands has contributed about $15 billion to NATO this year, or about 1.7% of its GDP and just under the NATO mandate of 2%.
Representatives of the Dutch military confirmed the shipment to USA TODAY but declined to comment further about the pricing or details.
The war in Ukraine has only increased the demand for private deals. The State Department signed off on more than $154 billion in commercial arms deals directly to foreign countries in 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year. 
Direct commercial sales represent a modest portion of the contribution to Ukraine compared with the $44 billion donated by the U.S., but they still amounted to more than $600 million in sales from U.S. companies to the Ukrainian government last year alone. That doesn’t include sales to other countries that also support Ukraine – sales like the one Brown described.
Jim Bartlett, an attorney with expertise in the specialized international arms transactions, said private U.S. businesses are playing a small but important role in the conflict.
“American companies are happy to export defense articles to foreign buyers approved by the U.S. State Department,” Bartlett said. “There’s an effort at the State Department to quickly clear the ones headed for Ukraine. … You get head-of-the-line privileges.”
Those sales also come with risks. 
Direct sales face fewer regulatory controls, oversight and enforcement, said Robert Nichols, an international military sales expert and attorney at the law firm Nichols Liu.
“You can imagine the range of characters involved in supplying a war effort,” Nichols said. “Some are highly credible. Others will skirt the law and sometimes step over the line by paying bribes, committing fraud and hiding their transactions.” 
So far, the Department of Justice has indicted just a handful of arms brokers over deals related to the war in Ukraine. Court records show the government has charged Miami-based Oleg Patsulya and Vasilii Besedin with illegally attempting to sell American-made aircraft parts to Russia. They allegedly lied to Commerce Department agents and told them the parts were bound for Turkey. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges this summer. 
A State Department spokesman declined to provide details of enforcement actions but said, “The United States takes seriously our responsibility to protect American military and dual-use technologies and prevent their diversion, including through strong enforcement actions.”
NATO said it oversees allied arms deliveries, and that those arms generally reach Ukraine. NATO itself technically only provides non-non-lethal aid, like fuel, medical supplies and generators.
Brown, of Battle Born, says he fields calls weekly from “clowns” without the proper licensing, whom he reports to the State Department for potential violations. Some raise red flags when they approach him about transactions that include payment via diamonds or gold.
He prefers traditional wire transfers with approved sales partners since he knows government officials are watching. He validates the contracts and checks certificates for the final users. That’s part of why he traveled with the ammunition. He would be meeting a Dutch military official for the official handoff.
“My job is to keep us all out of jail,” Brown said. 
The two 747s touched down in Poland, one before the sun, the other in late morning. Brown exchanged paperwork with a young Dutch military staffer who signed for the delivery, he said. They traded military patches as souvenirs. They snapped a photo together. 
The bullets bought by the Netherlands would never touch Dutch soil. 
U.S. aid:Billions from the US flows to Ukraine. Here's where it comes from, and how it adds up
Despite playing a small role proportionately in the war, $600 million in direct commercial sales can buy a lot of small weaponry. 
And those weapons are the kind most apt to fall into illicit use, said Elias Yousif, a research analyst at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit think tank.
Put another way: It’s hard to sneak away an F-16 or a missile launcher the size of a tractor-trailer. But a bunch of guns or a pallet of ammo? Much easier to resell. 
“In the commercial sector, especially in a new market, the risk increases,” Yousif said.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss arms research project, estimated that within a year, battlefield seizures and other forms of diversion led to 300,000 small arms and light weapons going missing, including 100,000 in Crimea alone.
When small arms go missing, they can go missing into another country, maybe one led by a despot or even a terrorist organization.
The U.S. government says diversion of American donations has been widely absent so far in Ukraine. That could be a combination of intensive “end-use-monitoring” programs and the reality of the battlefield, where supplies are rapidly put to use.
But even if not now, unused ammo could be resold someday. 
“History shows us this isn’t a short-term issue,” Yousif said.  “These are commodities with very long shelf lives.” 
Florida-based Global Ordnance, another State Department-licensed exporter, is a competitor in the direct weapons sales business. General counsel Bryan Van Brunt said the company has extensive protocols in place to track shipments and make sure the end-users are federally approved, though he declined to provide specifics about those systems. 
Brown, with Battle Born Munitions, says the company employs a mix of simple and sophisticated tracking technology to ensure his shipments are tracked to end users. The black GPS devices he dropped onto his cargo tracked the ammo all the way across the globe.
But that system only works as long as Brown is actually tracking. “Technically, my role ends when I deliver it to NATO,” he said.
Sometime after the 747s touched down in Poland, along with signing the paperwork and snapping a selfie with the Dutch official, Brown found the tiny black GPS trackers and lifted them off the pallets. 
Ukrainian trucks would arrive at the airport to pick up the ammunition. They would point toward the border, and onward to Lviv, and some distant battlefield. 
Brown would point in the opposite direction. Just like one of his quips: Fly in, have soup, get home. He headed toward Warsaw, with the GPS trackers in his bag.

The geography professor didn’t hide his clown fetish or the fact that he sometimes indulged his urges by recruiting students as subjects. He posted regularly about it on social media.
“I have a facepaint fetish and convince the cute girls in my classes to let me paint their faces,” he once wrote.
Yet Joseph Tokosh held jobs at two colleges and was on the tenure track at a third before student journalists at Nicholls State University in Louisiana exposed his behavior. He submitted his resignation the same day their story was published.
His interactions with students and open discussion of his fetish happened in both mainstream and tailored digital spaces. He popped into Facebook groups geared toward new students and niche forums on websites like Reddit. He posted videos on YouTube. In one Reddit post on a forum meant to highlight hard-to-believe stories, Tokosh posted pictures of several women in white face paint.
Over the years, two students reported him to campus police; others complained online. He left Kent State University after pleading no contest to something different: a theft charge that involved entering his peers’ offices without permission and taking a USB drive. Tokosh has not been charged with any other crime.
Tokosh’s career trajectory exposes inadequacies in the background check system that colleges and universities are supposed to have in place to protect students – especially when evidence of the concerning behavior resides largely on the internet. Nicholls State, for example, told USA TODAY Network reporters it does not routinely check social media for new hires.
A federal law intended to ensure the academic privacy of students also makes it difficult to determine how Tokosh was able to move so freely from campus to campus. Both Kent State and Northern Illinois University – where he taught while finishing his doctorate – noted Tokosh’s protected status as a graduate student in declining to answer questions.
Sophie Levan was a freshman at Kent State in 2017 when she encountered Tokosh, then 28, in a Facebook group intended as a gathering place for new students. Tokosh had offered cash to anyone willing to let him paint their faces. Levan, then 18, agreed.
The money was appealing but the interactions soured. 
Tokosh, she said, insisted he come pick her up and take her to the building that housed the geography department, where he would paint her face. Uneasy, Levan stopped responding. Tokosh got angry and wouldn’t give up, she said, which led her to file a police report.
“I felt like the school would want to know about it,” Levan said. “I thought maybe they could prevent anything bad from happening since other girls would go with him.”
She said there was never any followup from campus police – or anyone else.
USA TODAY Network reporters reviewed the experiences of six students who were the subject of Tokosh’s attention going back to his time at Kent State.
In addition to Levan, the other person who reported Tokosh to campus police could not be reached for comment. The two who expressed public concerns on social media told USA TODAY they never heard from their campus officials either.
USA TODAY attempted to reach Tokosh via phone, social media and a certified letter. A person answered a phone call to a number associated with Tokosh, but he hung up after the reporter identified himself. A reporter also reached someone who identified herself as Tokosh’s mother. She said she would pass along that reporters were trying to reach him.
Tokosh told the Nicholls student journalists that he did have an assignment where students were required to paint their faces as part of a cultural exercise. Prior to the article in the student newspaper The Nicholls Worth, the university had already cut Tokosh loose. He said his contract was not renewed because he was the target of a “grade inflation task force.”
The university, however, “does not have any such task force,” according to Nicholls spokesman Jerad David.
Tokosh also told students the face painting was a requirement in his cultural geography class to better understand other cultures. In a video interview with Hannah Robert, the station manager for the student-run KNSU TV, he says: “That's an assignment in one of my classes where they actually come up with their own face paint and makeup design inspired by a culture and they implement it.”
It’s a well-established trend in the academic world for professors to bounce from one institution to another without having to disclose why they left their last post, said Julie Libarkin, an associate dean at Michigan State University. She has seen the pattern often in her work maintaining a database of publicly documented sexual misconduct by faculty and staff.
As for grad students? Libarkin said people have requested she add them to her list, but universities’ conservative interpretations of the law get in the way.
“I don’t on purpose,” she said, “because that’s information that almost never comes out.”
Tokosh arrived at Kent State in 2015 with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in geography from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, according to his curriculum vitae. He was working toward his doctorate and researched fading businesses. His work about shopping malls in the Rust Belt won several awards. Like many graduate students, he also taught classes.
Then, Tokosh started showing up in the Facebook groups for new students. In a December 2017 post, an account under the name “Joe Tokosh” posted several pictures of women made up to look like clowns or skulls.
“If anyone is looking for some extra cash, I am looking for people to practice facepainting on!” he wrote. “I will literally pay you!”
Those are the types of posts that caught Levan’s eye. Not only was she pressed for cash, she was interested in movie makeup and thought the face painting could be fun based on the photos Tokosh had posted. But Levan said she soon realized that those images were stock photos and not representative of what Tokosh could do.
What’s more, she figured out that he was a graduate student, a fact she said he didn’t disclose in his posts.
When Tokosh offered to pick her up from her dorm, she refused. But, she said, Tokosh kept insisting she agreed to participate. Levan stopped responding to his messages and filed a police report with the Kent State police in January 2018. They advised her only to stop talking to Tokosh, she said, and let them know if “anything of consequence occurred.”
Months after she refused to meet up and filed the police report, Tokosh texted a picture of himself wearing white face paint to her cellphone. It arrived at midnight and contained no message, although writing on his shirt read: “I'm not a failure.”  
“There was some negative intention with sending that photo,” Levan said. “It’s definitely burned into my mind.”
What Levan didn’t know is that campus police had been put on notice a year earlier when another student filed a similar report. That student told police Tokosh reached out to her and her friends after they posted their numbers on a Facebook group for undergraduates. He would send “get to know you” messages, the police report said, and then ask the student if she was “interested in having her face painted for one of his class projects.”
When she found out Tokosh was a graduate student, she said no and eventually blocked him on Facebook and Snapchat, according to the report. Tokosh continued to text her.
“She does not have any concerns for her safety, but just wanted this documented,” the police report read. 
In July 2017, another student had retweeted a message from Kent State’s Twitter account that asked for Kent State love stories. She wrote: “A geography professor requested me on facebook and asked if he could paint my face like a clown.”
The student confirmed to USA TODAY that the professor was Tokosh and shared a screenshot of a Facebook friend request he sent her. She said she suspected Tokosh also found her on a freshman Facebook group because she posted there often.
She said she tweeted to draw officials’ attention to it and moved on but now wishes she had reported it officially.
College campuses are supposed to offer students special protections from sexual harassment even when it falls short of criminal behavior. Title IX, often associated with equity in women’s sports, also addresses “sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence” at schools that receive federal funding.
Colleges infrequently and unevenly enforce the rule, however. A 2022 USA TODAY investigation found just one of every 12,400 students was suspended in connection with sexual misconduct.
The student who shared her story online said the only response she received was from a graduate student in the geography department, who contacted her on Oct. 1, 2018. In an email, he wrote that he had seen her post and suspected he knew which faculty member had asked her about face painting.
“I brought it to the attention of some of our faculty because I was pretty sure I knew who it was, but they were certain it wasn’t that individual and that you probably just meant geology,” he wrote. 
He went on to reference another student being “approached in (at least by just looking at your tweet) a much more aggressive way.” The grad student asked the undergraduate for more information, but, she told USA TODAY, she didn’t respond. She said she started drafting a reply, but a year had passed. She wanted to move on.
Kent State would not say whether any actions were taken after the students’ reports, but Eric Mansfield, a spokesman for the university, said the police department confirmed that the students who filed police reports were provided with “university resources, which would include other non-criminal avenues to pursue (Counseling Services, Title IX, Center for Sexual and Relationship Violence Services, etc.) as a general police practice.”
Levan does not recall police offering her services, but she said she didn’t want counseling. She wanted Tokosh investigated.
Mansfield also said that the university monitors social media but that colleges “can’t always see or track every mention on social media.”
Police records show that officers did investigate when Tokosh was accused of breaking into geography department offices. A blotter item in the local newspaper shows police obtained an arrest warrant in connection with a third-degree felony burglary charge. Court documents indicate Tokosh pleaded no contest to a theft on Oct. 19, 2018.
Kent State would not explain what led to Tokosh’s departure during that fall semester. Instead, the university said that since Tokosh was a graduate student, any information about him was protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It also would not say whether school officials shared Tokosh’s disciplinary record with other colleges or even if it was standard practice to do so for grad students.
“Due to FERPA, student education records are private,” said Emily Vincent, a university spokeswoman. “Also, we do not comment on personnel matters.”
When Congress passed FERPA in 1974, its author, Sen. James L. Buckley of New York, said the intent was to protect the academic privacy of students and their families. In more recent years, Buckley has become critical of the law and how schools interpret it. He told the Columbus Dispatch in 2010 that “the law needs to be revamped.”
Survivors of sexual violence and students accuse universities of using the law to avoid negative media coverage. Students with a history of bad behavior may jump from one school to another without the public ever knowing about their histories. Law enforcement records don’t fall under FERPA’s purview, but a wide variety of questionable behavior does.
One case involved Brandon Austin, who was accused of sexual assault at Providence College in 2013 while on the school’s basketball team. But Providence College initially said Austin was suspended for violating the school’s code of student conduct and declined to share further details with the Providence Journal, citing federal privacy laws. Austin denied wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime. 
Austin was able to transfer to the University of Oregon, where he was again accused of sexual assault, along with other players. Police investigated the claims, and the local district attorney declined to press charges. The university expelled him anyway but raised FERPA when it declined to release records showing what Oregon knew about the allegations, according to the Oregonian.
LeRoy Rooker was the director of the U.S. Education Department office that oversaw FERPA for more than two decades. Rooker, now a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said FERPA is not a confidentiality law – it is focused on education records. And it doesn’t apply when a student is “seeking or intending to enroll” at another college.
Therefore, Rooker said, Kent State could have shared information about Tokosh with Northern Illinois.
Rooker also said FERPA would not have prevented Kent State from telling reporters if other universities had inquired about Tokosh, though they could not have disclosed what they shared.
He blamed the overuse of the law on fear of being sued.
“In this litigious age, institutions get a little wonky about whether they will forward, say, disciplinary records,” Rooker said. “On the other hand, if you have something and you don’t share it when you can and something happens at the next institution, I would say that’s a big liability.”
Backgrounding job applicants has become increasingly complex.
While most U.S. employers conduct background screening, according to trade group data, those inquiries typically focus on criminal history. Social media receives far less attention even though that is where people are most likely to share their unguarded thoughts.
Undertaking a full review of a person’s social media presence is more difficult than just checking an applicant’s Facebook page.
Does an applicant have an account on X, formerly Twitter? How about an account with Discord, an online platform frequented by gamers, where leaked Pentagon documents were recently shared? Or what about a Telegram account, a messaging platform popular among white nationalists? Further complicating things, it’s common on sites like Reddit for users to adopt usernames and describe experiences with little to no ties to reality.
A little digging, however, can turn up a lot of dirt.  
Tokosh has a LinkedIn page that includes his teaching stints at Northern Illinois University and Nicholls State University. His time as a student and instructor at Kent State is absent.
For LinkedIn, a custom URL includes a play on his name and his chosen field of study: Joeography. Tokosh would later use that moniker in promotional materials for a class at Nicholls State. That is the same handle used on Reddit by someone with a special interest in face paint.
One post features a video of Tokosh throwing a pie at someone. Other posts mention a “clown fetish.” In a forum titled “Creepy,” he wrote, “I convince pretty girls to let me paint their faces,” along with a photo with multiple women in white face paint.
That and other similar posts remained live for years until they were taken down after the Nicholls students published their story in late March.
USA TODAY Network reporters captured screenshots before they disappeared. With dates in 2019, the posts feature a young woman wearing a Kent State T-shirt. The material would have been available to administrators at Northern Illinois before the start of the fall 2019 semester.
Joe King, a spokesman for Northern Illinois, said departments hiring new graduate students are “not required to check social media or investigate a disciplinary history.” He added some departments may reach out to the graduate students’ former advisers.
King said he could not determine if the university was aware of Tokosh’s behavior at Kent State. He said that due to FERPA, he could not share specifics about Tokosh’s time at Northern Illinois, including whether students had complained about him.
But there are signs the behavior continued.
A YouTube account under the name “Joe Tokosh” included at least two videos in 2020 of a man throwing pies at women. One of the videos features a young woman also seen in the screenshots from Tokosh’s Reddit account. 
Comments on one from October 2020 read: “You can have a video of her tied up getting pied via cash app.” That video was viewed more than 30,000 times before it was turned off in late July, around the time a USA TODAY reporter reached out to Tokosh.
A former Northern Illinois State student shared text messages exchanged with Tokosh in which he asked to paint her face on multiple occasions. USA TODAY has agreed not to name her because she is concerned Tokosh might retaliate against her.
In the text messages, Tokosh shared a photo of a young woman in white face paint – an image also posted to the Joeography Reddit account. She said she declined to do it but was aware that other Northern Illinois students had participated.
By fall 2022, when he had moved on to Nicholls, Tokosh revealed to the student that he had required students in his cultural geography class to paint their faces.  
The Northern Illinois student asked Tokosh what he did with the photos, and she said he suggested that he might spin them off into a research project someday. She asked, had anyone complained? She said Tokosh responded: Why would they?
Many students would find a reason to complain, as Nicholls State student journalist Sally-Anne Torres learned firsthand. It started in January when one of her fellow reporters picked up an odd rumor: a professor was offering extra credit for students willing to paint their faces like clowns. Initially, Torres dismissed it because it seemed too unusual and there weren’t a lot of leads to follow. 
By Feb. 7, university administrators informed Tokosh that his contract would not be renewed, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY via a records request. They gave no reason for the nonrenewal, but on Feb. 12, Tokosh emailed his students that the university was letting him go. He blamed his departure on giving too many A’s.
That seemed suspicious to Torres. 
During her reporting, she received a tip about Tokosh’s Reddit posts in which he wrote of his “clown fetish” and how he enlisted his students to participate in it.
“It wasn’t just this innocent thing that a lot of these girls thought it was,” Torres said. “As a professor or teacher, that is somebody students are supposed to trust. He used his power to ruin that trust and to do these things, and that made me angry for them.”
Torres spoke to six students who shared their experiences with Tokosh. Some, she said, were followed on Twitter by him while others opted into an extra credit assignment he offered.
The women told Torres he sometimes giggled and laughed as they painted their faces in his office.
On March 27, the Nicholls Worth published a story headlined, “Geography professor suspended immediately, students allege sexual harassment.” KNSU TV, a student broadcast network, also aired footage in which Tokosh defended the assignment on camera. That same day, Tokosh submitted his resignation.
The story’s publication prompted other students to come forward about Tokosh and their frustration with the university.
Bradley Price took an online class with Tokosh and said the professor required students to photograph themselves with their faces painted. Price said Tokosh told them the assignment was to help them understand Japanese culture, but then Tokosh offered him bonus points if he could get a female friend to paint her face.
It seemed unusual at the time, Price said, because his friend wasn’t in the class. It became more concerning to him on reading the student newspaper’s report.
“I feel frankly disgusted and disappointed that Nicholls couldn’t do a proper background check on this professor, because this is unacceptable,” Price said. 
Bella Ramos, a junior at Nicholls State who did not take any of Tokosh’s classes, told USA TODAY that someone using the handle @Joeography21 followed her on Twitter in late 2021 and started liking all her selfies.
Ramos learned that the person behind the account was likely a professor at the university. She posted about the behavior in January 2022, but nothing came of it. She also found the Joeography Reddit account. On March 27, the same day the student newspaper published its piece, Ramos posted screenshots of her discoveries on Twitter with the message, “Found a Nicholls state university professor on Reddit.”
“I wish the university had acted sooner because all this information was public on the internet,” she told USA TODAY. 
No one from the university, she said, has ever reached out.

An Oct. 17 Instagram post (direct link, archive link) claims veteran actor Arthur Roberts has secretly been Joe Biden’s body double.
“The title of the video in Arthur’s acting credit is ‘Joe Biden Sworn in as U.S. President on Inauguration Day 2021,’” a man says in an embedded video, as an image of a screenshot from IMDB.com appears. “Now when you go to this page, it’s not there no more. It’s been erased. But we got screenshots.”
The post was liked more than 300 times in a day.

There is no evidence that President Joe Biden has a body double. Roberts has no association with Biden and has never appeared as him, according to the actor’s representative.
Roberts, an 85-year-old actor, has numerous stage, screen and film credits, according to his professional website and IMDB profile. None of those roles involved playing Biden, and he has no connection to the president.               
“It is not true,” said Kathryn Boole, a manager with Studio Talent Group, which represents Roberts. “Arthur is an actor. He is in his 80s, but he does auditions all the time and he gets roles and he works in the film and TV industry. And he would never even have time to be a double.”
Boole said this claim previously surfaced several years ago when Roberts was edited into pictures that were shared on social media.
The current version of the claim hinges on an IMDB entry that listed Roberts as playing Biden at his 2021 inauguration. The linked page is now dead, and the credit has been removed from his profile on the site. But an archive of the page shows it was on IMDB on Aug. 19 and taken down no later than Sept. 15.
Users can submit a request to add a TV or movie title or an on-screen credit to IMDB, according to its guidelines. Those are supposed to be reviewed by editors before they can be published.
IMDB did not respond to a request for comment. Boole said she had no idea how that credit was attached to Roberts and had no record of him ever portraying Biden in any project.

Baseless claims that Biden has a body double are not new. USA TODAY has debunked claims that Biden died in 2019 and was secretly replaced by either his (non-existent) twin or an actor, as well as a claim that his body double revealed himself by signing documents with the wrong hand.

U.S. Capitol Police said Thursday that they arrested more than 300 protesters who held a demonstration inside a U.S. House office building in Washington D.C., over the Israel-Hamas war.
Protesters with Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow were detained on Capitol Hill while calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, a narrow strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.
Police reported that the protest broke out at the Cannon House Office Building just before 1:40 p.m. Wednesday and shut down roads outside the building due to the demonstration.
Video shows demonstrators wearing black T-shirts reading "Jews Say Ceasefire Now" in white lettering shouting "Ceasefire now!" Other footage shows the group sitting on the Cannon Rotunda floor clapping in unison.
U.S. House and Senate office buildings are open to the public but protests are forbidden in congressional buildings.

Arrests took place in the Cannon Rotunda, police reported.
U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Paul Starks told USA TODAY on Thursday that police arrested 308 people on charges of crowding, obstructing, or incommoding in a forbidden area. They were ticketed and released.
Of those arrested, three people were also charged with assault of a police officer because, Starks said, they resisted arrest.
Starks said police were not aware of any major injuries.
The rotunda was cleared by 5 p.m., police said.
The war:As war in Israel, Gaza rages on, President Biden is having a moment
On Oct. 7, a major Jewish holiday, Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns. The attack, which killed hundreds of civilians, stunned Israel and caught its military and intelligence apparatus completely off guard.
Israel immediately launched airstrikes on Gaza, destroying entire neighborhoods and killing hundreds of Palestinian civilians in the days that have followed.
As of Thursday, the war's death toll surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides. At least 199 people, including children, were captured by Hamas and taken into Gaza, according to Israel.
The leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, said in a recorded message that the assault was in response to Israel's 16-year blockade of Gaza; Israeli raids inside West Bank cities over the past year, violence at at the Al-Aqsa Mosque − built on a contested Jerusalem holy site sacred to Jews as the Temple Mount; increased attacks by settlers on Palestinians; and the expansion of Jewish settlements on occupied lands Palestinians claim for a future state.
The Hamas incursion came on Simchat Torah, a normally joyous day when Jews complete the annual cycle of reading the Torah scroll. Israel declared war the next day.
Previous Israel-Hamas wars were in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021.

A second co-defendant with Donald Trump in the Georgia election conspiracy case, Sidney Powell, pleaded guilty Thursday to a half-dozen misdemeanors dealing with a conspiracy to interfere in the 2020 election.
Legal experts said Powell's central role in the conspiracy, as an election lawyer who baselessly claimed widespread election fraud in 2020, could have an impact on other defendants charged in the alleged racketeering conspiracy that sought to keep Trump in power.
“Miss Powell is at the vortex, the center, the hub of the alleged conspiracy,” said Gene Rossi, who handled Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations cases in his three decades as a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official. “She will be a phenomenal witness for the government because she was at strategic meetings, part of important conversations and she was a leader in implementing the scheme to discredit the lawful election of Joe Biden.”
Powell was initially charged with racketeering and six other counts as part of a wide-ranging scheme to overturn the election so Trump could remain in power. She was charged with tampering with election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia.
She pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit theft by taking and five counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with performance of election duties. Powell agreed to testify in future trials in exchange for serving six years of probation, a $6,000 fine and paying restitution of $2,700.
Powell is one of 19 co-defendants charged in the case, which alleged a broad racketeering conspiracy. Other portions of the conspiracy included the recruitment of fake presidential electors to vote for Trump despite President Joe Biden winning Georgia, lying about election results to state officials and in court records, and soliciting public officials to violate their oaths of office.
Legal experts said Powell's agreement to testify against others in the case is "very significant" because she dealt at length with Trump, lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others charged in the conspiracy.
"I think it's very significant because she is one of the people who was closest to Trump in many of these alleged nefarious activities, and as part of the agreement, she must testify truthfully against Trump as well as the other defendants,' said John Banzhaf, a George Washington University law professor who has been following the case closely. "So it is a major victory for Fani Willis and certainly a major concern for Trump."
Powell worked closely with major figures in the chase. She participated in a news conference with Giuliani and co-defendant Jenna Ellis at the Republican National Committee portraying baseless allegations of election in November 2020. Powell met with Trump at the White House, including on Dec. 18, 2020, to discuss having the military seize voting machines, which Trump didn't order.
"Given the central role she played in public promotion of false claims of election fraud, it seems likely that she has significant information about the role of her co-defendants," said Alexander Reinert, a Benjamin Cardozo School of Law professor.
Kevin O’Brien, a former federal prosecutor now at Ford O’Brien Landy, called it a “very, very smart move” for Powell to pay a fine, avoid jail and keep her law license.
“Rudy Giuliani, as if he doesn't have enough to worry about, should be very worried,” O’Brien said. “Remember those press conferences the two  gave on all their ‘evidence’ of election interference?”
Rossie said Powell's guilty plea may persuade others to cooperate with prosecutors, turning "the slippery slope into a luge when it comes to cooperators."
Powell is the second co-defendant to plead guilty in the case, after bail bondsman Scott Hall.
The other 17 co-defendants have all pleaded not guilty. Powell’s guilty plea came days before her trial was scheduled to begin Monday. Another co-defendant, lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, who is charged with developing the scheme to recruit fake electors, still has a trial scheduled Monday.
While Powell was involved in a separate part of the conspiracy from Chesebro, Banzhaf said her guilty plea could affect him because he continues to face charges with a five-year minimum sentence and no opportunity for a federal pardon.
"I think it's also likely to convince Chesebro because he's in exactly the same boat," Banzhaf said. "Also, it's going to leave him standing alone in the courtroom. If the two of them were tried together at least they have each other, so to speak, a little bit of mutual support. Now he's going to be on his own and his attorney's going to have to work twice as hard."
Prosecutors initially charged Powell with conspiring with Hall and others to access election equipment without authorization and hired computer forensics firm SullivanStrickler to send a team to Coffee County, to copy software and data from voting machines and computers there.
The indictment said an unnamed person sent an email to a top SullivanStrickler executive and instructed him to send all data copied from Dominion Voting Systems equipment in Coffee County to an unidentified lawyer associated with Powell and the Trump campaign.

Taylor Wilson:
Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson, and this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday the 19th of October 2023. Today, a look at what an independent investigation into the Gaza hospital strike could look like. Plus the suspect and the disappearance of Natalee Holloway has confessed to her murder. And the House is still frozen without a speaker.
♦
President Joe Biden has secured an agreement with Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. That's as he returns home following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in the wake of a strike on a hospital in Gaza City that killed hundreds of people. Protests have erupted across the Middle East after the blast, with thousands taking to the streets in many Arab countries to condemn Israel's airstrikes on Gaza. Many questions remain about the strike on the hospital, including who's at fault. I spoke with USA Today Domestic Security Correspondent Josh Meyer about whether an independent investigation could help bring answers. Josh, thanks for making the time.
Josh Meyer:
My pleasure, Taylor.
Taylor Wilson:
So just starting here, Josh, what exactly happened in this Gaza hospital strike? What do we know as of now?
Josh Meyer:
Well, that's a good question. We don't really know. We know that a missile or some kind of ordinance landed on the hospital or at the hospital parking lot, killed several hundred people that were either injured and at the hospital or people seeking shelter there. But Israel is saying that it was an errant rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is another militant group in the Palestinian territories, along with Hamas. Hamas and the Palestinians are saying that Israel did it and said that they did it on purpose, and that they had been warning people to evacuate hospitals and that this was part of that effort. So the problem is both sides insist they're right. Israel offered a lot more forensic evidence to back up its assessment that it was not responsible for the missile strike, including intercepts and public source information and satellite imagery, suggesting that the rocket was fired northbound from south in the Gaza Strip. But this may be one of those circumstances where you need some kind of independent investigation to determine really what happened in a way that people believe.
Taylor Wilson:
And Josh, what types of independent investigative teams could find out who's responsible here?
Josh Meyer:
So I talked to David Scheffer, who's an independent law expert who served as the first US ambassador at large for war crimes. And this is exactly what it would be if it was an intentional strike, it would be a war crime. And he said that you need a dream team of forensic scientists skilled enough to look at the evidence on the ground and also that evidence that's been put forward by all sides, including Hamas, Israel and the Biden administration. The problem is they need to be on the ground almost right away because the evidence will dissipate. It's something that's not going to stay very long. One option is the International Criminal Court. Another option is the United Nations Affiliated Commission of Inquiry. A third one is the International Commission of Jurists, which is based in Geneva, Switzerland. And then there's also a Commission for International Justice and Accountability.
Taylor Wilson:
Josh, what are some of the unique challenges to an independent probe in Israel and Gaza amid all of this violence?
Josh Meyer:
Well, it's going to be tricky, especially, Taylor, because of the politics involved. It's one of those things where almost anybody Israel recommends to be on the investigative team might be rejected by the Palestinians. Anybody Palestine, the Gaza authorities or Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad recommends would be vetoed by Israel. So the question is getting people that are expert enough to really get ahold of all of the evidence and assess what happened but also get a team together that's going to be allowed into the hospital area to investigate this and also that's going to be accepted by Israel and Hamas and the authorities in Gaza. So one thing to remember is that the International Criminal Court one might think is the best option here because they have jurisdiction over the Palestinian territories, including Gaza, according to Scheffer, the war crimes expert I talked to. But Israel would likely contest that too because Israel is not a party to the ICC, nor is the United States.
And actually, in 2021, when the top ICC prosecutor confirmed the opening of an investigation into potential atrocities committed in the territories, Anthony Blinken, who was the Secretary of State at the time and still is, said that the US government firmly opposes that decision too. Basically the Biden administration said that the ICC has no jurisdiction over the matter, in part because Israel is not a party to the ICC, but he also said that the Palestinian territories were not technically covered by the International Criminal Court. So again, it's very politicized and it's going to be tough to find any neutral body that exists or that could be created to really look into this.
Taylor Wilson:
And President Joe Biden has been visiting Israel this week. We know he's said to give an address tonight about this hospital strike and there have also been mass protests surrounding this hospital attack and the conflicting answers after it. Do we have any sense of what to expect from Biden's remarks on this?
Josh Meyer:
Yeah, I mean, I think the sense we're getting is that Biden's going to talk about two things. One, he's going to try to lower the temperature. It's become so politicized. You're seeing protests and threats and anger across the United States and across the world, so he's going to be trying to sort of talk to people and hope that level heads prevail. But I think he's also going to talk about US funding for Israel and providing the Israeli government with whatever money they need to protect Israeli citizens. And I think that we may expect that he will also provide some money for the Palestinian Territories, for the people there too. The conditions that they're living in right now, especially with Israel's mounting response to the October 7th attacks, which were horrific. But the Palestinians, according to reports, are living without food, easy access to water. There's a lot of sickness going on and so forth.
Taylor Wilson:
Josh Meyer, thank you so much for your insight on all of this. Appreciate it.
Josh Meyer:
As always, my pleasure. Thanks, Taylor.

The main suspect in the unsolved disappearance of Natalee Holloway has confessed to killing her. Court documents show that Joran Van Der Sloot has confessed to killing the teenager in 2005 and disposing of her remains before trying to extort her grieving family. Federal prosecutors accused him in a 2010 indictment of hatching a plot to sell information about the location of Holloway's remains to her grieving family in exchange for $250,000. They Van Der Sloot had already been serving a 28-year prison sentence in South America for the murder of a Peruvian businesswoman in 2010. He was extradited to the US in June to stand trial in the extortion case.
He was sentenced to 20 years in prison this week, but as part of his plea agreement, that sentence will run concurrently with his sentence in Peru on the murder case. As a condition of the plea deal, he agreed to reveal how Holloway died and how her body was disposed of according to a federal sentencing memorandum. Holloway was 18 when she vanished during a trip to Aruba with high school classmates. Van Der Sloot cannot be charged in the US for the suspected murder itself, even with a confession. But Natalee's mother, Beth, said that the knowledge gave her a sense of peace.

Republican lawmakers again failed to elect a new speaker of the House yesterday after Congressman Jim Jordan lost his second vote for the position. I caught up with USA Today Congress Campaigns and Democracy reporter Ken Tran for the latest. Ken, good to have you back on.
Ken Tran:
Thanks for having me.
Taylor Wilson:
Ken, what exactly happened here?
Ken Tran:
Congressman Jordan, Chair of the [inaudible 00:08:06] for House Judiciary Committee, faced a first ballot on Tuesday at noon. Here, he'd lost the first ballot, similar to former speaker Kevin McCarthy, who went through multiple rounds of voting. Jordan lost that first ballot by 20 defections. 20 GOP lawmakers were against the speakership. So on Wednesday at 11:00, he saw a second vote and he actually saw support fall. 22 GOP lawmakers voted against him, which is an indication that his support is falling and his speakership is in danger right now, or his prospective speakership.
Taylor Wilson:
And Ken, who are the main holdouts at this point preventing Congressman Jordan from winning the vote? What part of the party are we talking about here?
Ken Tran:
They span across a broad spectrum of the Republican Party but most of them are considered the more moderate Republicans who are namely upset with how the process has played out, especially the ousting of former speaker Kevin McCarthy. These moderate Republicans, such as Congressman Don Bacon from Nebraska, he represents a Biden won district. Congressman Steve Womack from Arkansas, he's a Senior Appropriator. Also Congresswoman Kay Granger from Florida, she's chair of the very powerful House Appropriations Committee. So these lawmakers are, one, against Jim Jordan, partly because of his more conservative credentials, but also because Jordan and his allies inadvertently have started a pressure campaign on these lawmakers to vote for Jordan and making them more entrenched in their views and opposition against him.
Taylor Wilson:
And who's Jordan's biggest challenger for the position at this point?
Ken Tran:
That's the problem we're facing right now is that there is no clear challenger. His opponents are saying that Jordan will never be able to get the 217 votes necessary to become speaker. At the same time, it's very unclear who else in the Republican Party can do that. The most viable alternative talks right now is empowering the current acting speaker, speaker pro tempore Congressman Patrick McHenry, Republican from North Carolina, and giving him temporary powers to oversee more time-sensitive issues, such as funding the government by a mid-November deadline or passing a foreign aid package for Israel.
Taylor Wilson:
And Ken, what's happening at the house right now? Is it completely shut down from legislative action while this happens?
Ken Tran:
House committees can continue doing their work, but otherwise, any legislation cannot go to the floor. The House can only hold speaker elections. But also the thing with Patrick McHenry is that we've never been in this situation before. So anything that Patrick McHenry does as speaker pro tempore would set the precedent for anyone else in his position in the future. However, McHenry has been resistant to the idea of being empowered. He's laser focused right now, he says, on electing Jim Jordan to speaker. So as far as we've seen, he's only overseen speaker elections.
Taylor Wilson:
All right. There's a lot of hurry up and wait right now, Ken, what happens next here?
Ken Tran:
So Jordan will face a third vote at noon today, but we, again, don't know how many votes he's going to lose. He's expected to also lose this vote, and it's also possible he loses more support. If that does happen, we could see more GOP lawmakers start to urge him to drop out. He's indicated that he's going to stick in this for as long as it takes maybe. He's shown confidence that he will be elected speaker at some point. We just don't know when. So really just more waiting and seeing.
Taylor Wilson:
All right. Ken Tran, thank you as always for making time for us on another busy week. Thanks, Ken.
Ken Tran:
Thanks for having me.

Today is LGBTQ Center Awareness Day, a time to recognize the crucial resources offered by these kinds of community centers around the country and the world. But some are disappearing on US college campuses. And as it stands, there are only 250 professionally run LGBTQ centers on campuses across the country today, according to the Post-Secondary National Policy Institute. That makes up just a fraction of the nearly 4,000 colleges and universities in the US, all while a fifth of college students surveyed in 2020 by the Associated Press said they identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, queer, or questioning. And there are concerns from some that new bills in Texas and Florida aimed at banning offices dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, could cut these centers even further. Research shows that LGBTQ college students face persistent barriers to getting into college and staying there. And advocates say the safe spaces afforded by these centers can make a big difference.

The Las Vegas Aces are WNBA basketball Champions again. They won their second championship in a row last night, taking down the New York Liberty. Coach Becky Hammond, before the series, told her team, "This team over here was put together to take you out." That was a reference to the Frenzied Free Agency last year in women's basketball, where several teams attempted to gobble up some of the biggest stars and make super teams, while the Aces relied on their continuity from the previous season. They're now the WNBA's first back-to-back champion since the Los Angeles Sparks won it all back in 2001 and 2002.

Americans’ confidence in social media companies and their executives has plummeted. 
The leaders of social media companies have lost the faith of the American people that they responsibly handle, user privacy, according to a new report on digital privacy views from the Pew Research Center.
Some 77% of Americans have little or no trust that companies will publicly admit mistakes and take responsibility for data misuse, the report found.
Americans also have low expectations that regulators or lawmakers will crack down, with 71% saying they do not believe that social media companies will be held accountable by the government for misdeeds.
This deep-seated distrust is even more prevalent among Republicans and GOP leaners than Democrats and Democrat leaners, according to data Pew shared with USA TODAY.
Three-quarters of Republicans –  versus 68% of Democrats – doubt companies will face repercussions for misusing or compromising personal data.
Even more of them – 79% versus 75% – say they don’t trust social media companies to not sell their personal information without their consent. 
And the vast majority – 81% versus 76% – of Republicans don’t think companies publicly admit and take responsibility for their mistakes. 
Republicans are even more concerned about how the government uses their data. 
The share who say they are worried about government use of people’s data increased from 63% in 2019 to 77% today. Concern among Democrats has held steady at 65%, Pew said.
Pew research associate Colleen McClain cautioned that the partisan differences are “fairly small.”
“One striking pattern is how much distrust there is regardless of party,” she said.
The Pew findings come as political debate over online content is heating up in the middle of a presidential election.
Conservative frustration with social media reached a boiling point when Trump was banned from the major platforms after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.
The perception that social media companies are biased against conservatives intensified as Trump made “social media abuses” a major plank of his administration and reelection campaigns.
The alleged suppression and censorship of conservative voices and views will be heard by the Supreme Court this term. 
Complaints of ideological bias come from across the political spectrum, but it’s difficult to prove social media platforms are targeting any one group since the tech companies disclose so little about how they decide what content is allowed and what is not.
Social media companies say they don't target conservatives, only harmful speech that violates their rules.
Passwords might be one of the biggest tech frustrations. Make them too hard, and they're impossible to remember. Too easy, and your accounts are practically wide open.
You could use a password manager or your browser's built-in option to remember your logins. Here's how to find saved passwords in your browser.
Those solutions aren't perfect, of course. Password managers get hacked, and anyone with the know-how can access your saved browser options. No wonder tech companies are working to welcome us to a future sans passwords.
I write about the latest tech gear, security alerts and digital life hacks in my daily emails. Join 600K+ who get the Current each day. It's free!
Woof! It starts with the FIDO Alliance
That stands for Fast IDentity Online. Big tech companies launched the industry association in 2013 to build a better system than passwords we have to keep track of and type in. Now we're seeing more start to roll it out, and Google's beta testing worked so well that the company just made it the standard way to protect your account.
Before we get to how to use passkeys, let's do a deep dive into how they work.
What is a passkey, and how does it work?
A passkey is a personalized FIDO credential (like your fingerprint or face scan) that lives securely on your device. You use that instead of a username and password to unlock your accounts.
Another bonus: No more sticky notes with passwords on your monitor. Passkeys also eliminate the daily "Which password did I use here?" dilemma. Naturally, it'll be faster and easier to log in.
But is it safe to use? Glad you're asking. The unique structure of passkeys makes them near-impenetrable, unlike passwords – which are notoriously easy to crack. Since they're stored on your local device, passkeys can't be hacked or guessed like passwords.
And there's no concern of a hacker getting their hands on one of your passwords and opening the keys to the castle since each device has its unique passkey. That's a far cry from passwords, and studies show most people rely on only a handful of passwords for all their accounts.
Is paid social media the future? If you want privacy, probably.
Want to try it out?
If you're sick of typing in credentials all day, you can set up passkeys with your Google account.
Note: Passkeys are automatically created for Google devices, but you must set them up for any other gadgets you use to access your account(s). You need to do this individually on each device you want to give access to. Remember, a passkey lives on that device, so it's not just an accountwide setting.
◾ Go to g.co/passkeys.
◾ Tap Get passkeys and sign in.
◾ Select Use passkeys, then follow the onscreen prompts.
You'll be prompted to log in without your password in certain situations. My advice: Use biometric authentication (your fingerprint or face) anywhere you can. It's much more secure than a PIN.
Fear not, Apple folks
You can use passkeys with your iPhone too. These work through the iCloud Keychain. Make sure you have that turned on and two-factor authentication enabled to use passkeys. Note: To use passkeys, iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS 13, or tvOS 16 (or later) is required.
Depending on the website, browser, or app you're using, saving a passkey to your iPhone and iCloud Keychain usually consists of these steps:
◾ On your iPhone, go to the sign-in screen for a supported website or app and do one of the following: If setting up a new account: Tap the button or link for setting up new accounts, then follow the onscreen instructions.
◾ When you see the option to save a passkey for the account, tap Continue. Your passkey is saved.
Note: If you don't see a passkey option, the app or website doesn't currently support passkeys.
To sign in to an account on your iPhone with a passkey:
◾ On your iPhone, go to the website or app and tap the account name field on the sign-in screen.
◾ Tap the suggested account name that appears at the bottom of the screen or near the top of the keyboard. If the account name doesn't appear, or you want to use a different one, enter it.
◾ Use Face ID or Touch ID to complete sign-in. If you didn't set up Face ID or Touch ID on your iPhone, enter your device passcode (the code you use to unlock your iPhone).
The passkey you saved completes the sign-in automatically.
When using a device not associated with your Apple ID, you can still sign in to an account using the passkey stored on your iPhone. Here's how:
◾ On the other device, go to the website or app and enter your user name in the account name field on the sign-in screen.
◾ Select Other options, Passkey from nearby device, or similar, then follow the onscreen instructions to display a QR code on the screen.
◾ Use your iPhone camera to scan the QR code.
The passkey that's saved to iCloud Keychain completes the sign-in automatically.
Now, onward, with your safe new logins.

If you’re a T-Mobile customer, take a close look at your phone bill.
The cell phone carrier is running a test in which it automatically switches some customers to more expensive rate plans unless they opt out. 
"We haven’t kicked it off yet, this would be a small-scale test where we reach out to a small subset of customers who are on older rate plans to let them know they have the opportunity to move to newer, better plans with more features and more value," T-Mobile said in a statement to USA TODAY.
The rate hike affects some customers on older unlimited plans such as T-Mobile One, Simple/Select Choice, Magenta and Magenta 55 Plus. Those customers will be migrated to Go5G.
The new plans increase the cost per line by $10 (or $5 a line with auto pay). Go5G plans start at $75 a month per phone line including taxes and fees.
"Eligible customers would hear from us when this starts," T-Mobile said. "No customer accounts will be changed until then."
Customers can choose to stay on their current or similar plan if they prefer, T-Mobile said. If you want to opt out, call T-Mobile customer service.
T-Mobile markets itself as a customer-friendly “Un-carrier” but, with its 2020 takeover of Sprint, it has led a wave of consolidation that has left consumers with fewer choices.
T-Mobile-Sprint mergerWill you pay more for your cellular plan?
The carrier – now the country’s second largest of three nationwide cell phone networks – pledged not to raise rates on plans for three years to win regulatory approval for the Sprint takeover.
Rivals AT&T and Verizon raised rates on older plans last year.
Apple has announced a new, more affordable Apple Pencil that comes with a hidden USB-C charging port.
The newest version is "ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more," according to a news release from the company.
According to Apple, the new pencil is designed with a matte finish and a flat side that magnetically attaches to the side of an iPad for storage.
It will be available beginning in early November and cost $79.
The new pencil is also available for $69 for current and newly accepted college students and their parents, as well as faculty, staff, and home-school teachers of all grade levels.
Additionally, existing owners of the 1st generation Apple Pencil can get the USB-C to Apple Pencil adapter separately for $9.
Apple updates:Apple is urging everyone to update iPhone and iPad iOS (again). Why you should do it now.
“Combined with the versatility of iPad, the new Apple Pencil unlocks another great option to experience the magic of digital handwriting, annotation, marking up documents, and more,” said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of worldwide product marketing, in the news release.
Apple touts the new pencil's "pixel-perfect accuracy, low latency and tilt sensitivity," however it doesn't have the pressure sensitivity, wireless pairing and charging, double-tap to change tools, or free engraving features of the 2nd generation Apple Pencil.
The company said this is the most affordable model and it pairs well with the 10th generation iPad, as well as iPad Pros, iPad Airs and iPad Minis since they have USB-C ports.

U.S. Capitol Police said Thursday that they arrested more than 300 protesters who held a demonstration inside a U.S. House office building in Washington D.C., over the Israel-Hamas war.
Protesters with Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow were detained on Capitol Hill while calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, a narrow strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.
Police reported that the protest broke out at the Cannon House Office Building just before 1:40 p.m. Wednesday and shut down roads outside the building due to the demonstration.
Video shows demonstrators wearing black T-shirts reading "Jews Say Ceasefire Now" in white lettering shouting "Ceasefire now!" Other footage shows the group sitting on the Cannon Rotunda floor clapping in unison.
U.S. House and Senate office buildings are open to the public but protests are forbidden in congressional buildings.

Arrests took place in the Cannon Rotunda, police reported.
U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Paul Starks told USA TODAY on Thursday that police arrested 308 people on charges of crowding, obstructing, or incommoding in a forbidden area. They were ticketed and released.
Of those arrested, three people were also charged with assault of a police officer because, Starks said, they resisted arrest.
Starks said police were not aware of any major injuries.
The rotunda was cleared by 5 p.m., police said.
The war:As war in Israel, Gaza rages on, President Biden is having a moment
On Oct. 7, a major Jewish holiday, Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns. The attack, which killed hundreds of civilians, stunned Israel and caught its military and intelligence apparatus completely off guard.
Israel immediately launched airstrikes on Gaza, destroying entire neighborhoods and killing hundreds of Palestinian civilians in the days that have followed.
As of Thursday, the war's death toll surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides. At least 199 people, including children, were captured by Hamas and taken into Gaza, according to Israel.
The leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, said in a recorded message that the assault was in response to Israel's 16-year blockade of Gaza; Israeli raids inside West Bank cities over the past year, violence at at the Al-Aqsa Mosque − built on a contested Jerusalem holy site sacred to Jews as the Temple Mount; increased attacks by settlers on Palestinians; and the expansion of Jewish settlements on occupied lands Palestinians claim for a future state.
The Hamas incursion came on Simchat Torah, a normally joyous day when Jews complete the annual cycle of reading the Torah scroll. Israel declared war the next day.
Previous Israel-Hamas wars were in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021.

A fun outing at a pecan festival in Texas took a scary turn when a gust of wind launched a carnival ride car into the air and left its operator dangling 30 feet above the ground.
The ride operator was helping 12-year-old Juliana Bernal get into one of the cars on The Bullet at the 54th annual Groves Pecan Festival on Sunday afternoon in Groves, Texas, about 90 miles east of Houston near the Louisiana state line, reported KMBT-TV
A strong gust of wind suddenly propelled the car into the air with Juliana inside as the ride operator held onto the door to keep it shut and protect her, the station reported. He managed to do that all while the compartment turned 180 degrees and stalled 30 feet from the ground.
Video footage of the accident shared by KFDM-TV showed the operator hanging from the ride with his legs dangling in the air as people screamed and watched in horror.
Now he's being hailed as a hero.

Juliana's mother, Caress Muraira, told KMBT-TV that watching the incident unfold was one of the scariest moments of her life.
"It started going slow at first and he was trying to stop it, her door wasn't closed," she said. "So I started freaking out. As he went to close the door he just kind of flew up with it. My daughter was up there and talking to him saying, 'Please hang on. Don't fall.'"
Juliana also kept telling Muraira: "Mommy, I'm OK," she said.
It "felt like the longest time of my life," before employees were able to get the ride's motor going and lower the ride, bringing both the operator and Juliana to safety. Just before that the employees quickly removed a handful of children who were in a ground-level compartment of the ride.
The Bullet was shut down for the rest of the event.
Muraira said that she was immensely grateful to the ride operator for risking his life for her daughter.

Groves City Marshal Norman Reynolds told KMBT-TV that the ride operator was shaken up after the ordeal.
Muraira said that her daughter told her that she saw blood on the operator's fingers from where he was holding onto the ride.
A spokesperson for the festival organizer, the Groves Chamber of Commerce, told USA TODAY on Wednesday that the ride operator was fine and that they are not aware of any injuries.
Organized by the Groves Chamber of Commerce since 1969, the Groves Pecan Festival is a community-wide celebration that coincides with the yearly pecan harvest. Pecans are an integral part of the Groves landscape and have been a focal point for community growth, the chamber of commerce says.
A spate of recent incidents related to amusement rides and attraction has left riders stuck or injured.
On Sept. 29, an 8-year-old boy sustained significant injuries when he was "sucked out" of his seat on a ride called The Storm at the State Fair of Virginia.
In August, guests were forced to walk down a 200-plus-foot roller coaster at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio after the ride known as the Magnum XL experienced a mechanical issue.
Back in July, fairgoers in Crandon, Wisconsin, ended up in a terrifying predicament when a malfunction left riders stuck upside down for hours.
Just two days before that, a North Carolina amusement park closed one of its rollercoasters after guests noticed a crack in a support pillars and video showed pieces moving out of place as cars moved along the tracks.

This Great Dane is now a great dame.
Meadow, a Great Dane about 2½ years old, gave birth to 15 puppies on Oct. 10, the largest litter ever for Perfectly Imperfect Pups, a foster-based rescue service in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Before having the litter, Meadow lived an uneven existence — something shelter founder and director Nicole Kincaid hopes is in the canine's past.
"She has been passed around to five homes" since giving birth to another litter in February, Kincaid told USA TODAY. "She was being given away on social media and we reached out but unfortunately they gave her away pregnant to someone else."
That person then called Perfectly Imperfect Pups to report that Meadow wasn't getting along with their dogs and the rescue could take her.
"Two days later, she gave birth to 15 pups," she said.
Happy ending:Two Husky puppies thrown over a Michigan animal shelter's fence get adopted
In case you were wondering whether Meadow set any records beyond the shelter, her litter falls a bit short. A 2-year-old Great Dane from Virginia nearly set a world record after giving birth to almost two dozen puppies this past spring.
A Neapolitan mastiff named Tia currently holds the Guinness World Record for largest litter with 24 pups born in 2004.
Still, Meadow has been a media darling, getting coverage from local TV stations, People magazine and other outlets, which has led to a lot of interest in adopting Meadow and her puppies.
"We have had people reach out about adopting and we do hope the excitement lasts another seven weeks because we do not adopt puppies or Mama out until the puppies are 8 weeks," Kincaid said.
For now, one of Perfectly Imperfect Pups' foster homes is looking after Meadow and the pups. The foster mom "is supplement feeding in between feedings to make sure all puppies are getting food," Kincaid said.

Kincaid commended the home fostering Meadow, saying in a news release that her agency "is so proud of our foster parents. They take in dogs without knowing what the next few days or months could bring."
"Taking in a pregnant dog is even more of a challenge because you don’t always know when Mom will give birth, how many puppies will be born, or what complications may come along," she said. "It makes me so sad that Meadow had such an unsteady past, being bounced around is no life for a dog."
She continued to say that she's thrilled Meadow is with the rescue, and that "this will be her last litter and her next home will be her forever home.”
Feeding and caring for 15 puppies and a mom takes not just time but money. If you want to help out, Perfectly Imperfect Pups has created an Amazon Wishlist for needed items and products. You can also donate here by searching for Perfectly Imperfect Pups.

WASHINGTON — About 15 minutes into President Joe Biden's Zoom call last Friday with families of Americans taken hostage by Hamas, a White House aide started to end the session.
But Biden wouldn't have it, according to one of the family members on the call.
"The president actually looked at him and said: 'Last time I checked I'm the president of the United States. And this meeting will end when I say it ends,'" said Ruby Chen of Israel, the father of Itay Chen, a 19-year-old member of the Israel Defense Forces and a dual US-Israeli citizen who is among those missing. "He actually wanted to hear from every single one of us."
The moment encapsulated Biden's sudden transformation from a political figure whose commitment to Israel was often questioned by conservative critics inside and outside the Jewish state to – right now – arguably the world's leading champion of Israel outside the Middle East.
Biden's actions and words since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, capped by a dramatic visit Wednesday to Israel, have been lauded even by many of Biden's biggest skeptics in Israel as he stands in solidarity with Israel and pledges "unprecedented" military assistance.
"Israelis were hungry for a father figure that will hug them and show empathy. And the president has done that in such a way that really touched every Israeli," said Nimrod Novik, a former foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and now a fellow with the Israel Policy Forum.
Israelis last week displayed a billboard off a highway in Tel Aviv stating, "Thank you, Mr. President," next to Biden's image. A billboard welcomed Biden to Israel during his visit Wednesday.
The praise showering Biden in Israel comes as its own leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has seen his support in his country plummet in the wake of the Hamas attack and Israel's military response.
A poll from the firm, Maariv, Lazar Research, reported by Haaretz, found more than two-thirds of Israeli's prefer "someone else" than Netanyahu to serve as prime minister after the war. Benny Gantz, leader of Israel's National Unity Party, has seen his party's support soar since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.
"Absolutely, President Biden is the much more popular leader in Israel than Bibi Netanyahu," said Richard Stengel, a former under secretary of state in the Obama administration, in an interview on MSNBC.
Israeli support for Biden extends to his efforts to return home Americans who, like Itay Chen, make up some of an estimated 200 to 250 people believed to be held hostage by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.
Although polling on Biden's popularity in Israel since the attack isn't public, a whopping 48% of Israelis watched Biden's White House address last week when he condemned the attack as "pure, unadulterated evil" and committed U.S. military aid to Israel.
"It was quite remarkable how well that was received in Israel, including by people on the right wing who were not predisposed to like Biden," said Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. "It really resonated in Israel in a rather unique way, especially given the leadership vacuum in Israel right now."
During his whirlwind stop in Israel on Wednesday, Biden met with Netanyahu, family members of hostages and compared the atrocities of the Hamas attack, which killed more than 1,300 Israelis, to the brutality of the Holocaust.
"The world watched then and knew, and the world did nothing," Biden said in a speech from Tel Aviv with American and Israeli flags behind him. "We will not stand by and do nothing again. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever."
Biden cautioned Israelis "don’t be consumed" by the rage they feel today, warning about "mistakes" the U.S. after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Yet his backing of Israel was unmistakable.
"I'm here to tell you that terrorists will not win. Freedom will win," Biden concluded. "Israel will be a safe, secure Jewish and democratic state today, tomorrow and forever."
Biden, upon landing in Air Force One in Israel, greeted Netanyahu with a big hug.
The Israeli prime minister has faced criticism in Israel for the security failure that allowed the Hamas massacre to unfold. Netanyahu met Sunday for the first time with family members of kidnapped Israelis amid criticism that he's not done enough to save them.
“Your visit is the first here by an American president during a time of war," Netanyahu said to Biden. “Thank you, Mr. president. Thank you for standing with Israel today, tomorrow and always.”
Former President Donald Trump – who took actions such as relocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem – was widely popular in Israel during his presidency as well. Trump and other Republicans aligned themselves with the Israeli right, pushing a wedge between Jews and their historic support for Democrats, while some liberals in Congress sought to reduce foreign aid to Israel.
Yet over the last week, Biden has received glowing reviews from conservatives who once criticized Biden's foreign policy with Israel.
"In Judaism there is an obligation of 'Hakarat Hatov'”' — saying thank you to those who perform good deeds," David Friedman, former U.S. ambassador to Israel under Trump, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. While Friedman remains "deeply critical" of the Biden administration, he said "the moral, tactical, diplomatic and military support that it has provided Israel over the past few days has been exceptional."
Meanwhile, Trump stunned conservative Israelis with his comments last week blaming Netanyahu for the Hamas attack and calling leaders of Hezbollah "very smart." Many have since blasted Trump's remarks.
"Every Israeli should pray that Biden will continue for a second term," Ishay Cohen, a religiously conservative Israeli journalist, wrote on X above a video with Trump's comments.
Biden's actions have not been without harsh criticism among conservatives in the U.S. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican candidate for president, slammed Biden for committing $100 million in U.S. humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
"They say it's 'humanitarian assistance.' We know Hamas is going to commandeer that money and Hamas is going to use it to advance terrorism," DeSantis said. "How are you funding them when they're holding Americans as well as others hostage?"
And Republicans and Israelis alike criticized the Biden administration over a deal to free five American hostages from Iran that included transferring $6 billion to the nation for humanitarian purposes.
The U.S. and Qatar reportedly agreed to freeze Iran's access to the money last week after the agreement came under fire from Republicans who argued the money freed up funds for Tehran to help Hamas' attack. The Biden administration has said there is no evidence linking Iran to the massacre.
Still, Israel's support for Biden, at least for now, overshadows the pushback.
Ruby Chen, the father working to free his hostage son from Hamas, said Biden told family members on last week's Zoom call "nothing is more important" to him than seeing the safe return of American hostages.
As each family member spoke, a photo of their loved one flashed on the computer screen for the president to see. The meeting ended up lasting about an hour and 15 minutes.
"It was a very emotional session where he also shared some of his personal loss and how he copes with it," Ruby Chen said. "And I think simple people like us, having the president of the United States spend time with us, it was a touching gesture."

The Week 8 slate in college football features four Top 25 showdowns for our panel of experts to consider. The Saturday headliner features No. 3 Ohio State hosting No. 6 Penn State in a highly anticipated contest with Big Ten and national championship implications.
Three of the other major conferences feature key games as well. A share of the lead in the ACC is on the line as No. 4 Florida State hosts No. 17 Duke. Yes, Duke. In the Pac-12, No. 14 Utah visits No. 16 Southern California, a must win for both teams hoping to keep their slim College Football Playoff hopes alive. There's also the measure of the Trojans trying to get revenge for two losses to the Utes last season.
Speaking of revenge, there's a big one in the SEC as No. 8 Alabama hosts No. 15 Tennessee. The Crimson Tide lost one to the Volunteers in Knoxville. This season, both teams already have a lost, making this a College Football Playoff eliminator.
Our staff weighs in on those key clashes, while also looking for potential upsets among the rest of the Top 25.
WASHINGTON — The historic ousting of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier this month has left Americans divided over the unprecedented move − and the Republican Party may pay the price in the 2024 election.
House Republicans have struggled to coalesce around one leader since McCarthy's historic 15 rounds of voting to become speaker in January. He made history again two weeks ago as the first speaker ousted from the House. Since then, the House Republican conference hasn't been able to unite around a single candidate and elect a new speaker, with deep divisions roiling between hardline conservatives and centrists in the party.
With House lawmakers up for re-election in 2024, McCarthy's removal might factor into their odds of winning again, experts said.
“At the basic level, either one side needs to win this in-party fighting, a compromise must be reached, or the voters will attempt to fix it next year,” Kevin Wagner, a political science professor at Florida Atlantic University, told USA TODAY. 
Problems in the House can influence voters at home. Several polls already show that voters are about evenly split over McCarthy's removal as speaker.
A Yahoo News/YouGov poll released Oct. 16 found 31% of registered voters approve of McCarthy being ousted while 27% disapprove of the House's decision.
Likewise, a CNN/SSRS poll conducted from Oct. 4 to Oct. 9 found 50% approve the decision and 49% disapprove. Some 34% of Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents think his removal was bad for the GOP, while 30% think it was bad.
And a poll released from the Associated Press-NORC on Oct. 11 found that 25% of voters strongly or somewhat approve of McCarthy's removal, while 25% strongly or somewhat disapprove.
The polls were conducted before two failed votes for a new House speaker, including a second in which Republican nominee Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, earned less support than in the first election.
Ted Davis, a 58-year-old retiree in Portland, Oregon, is one of the voters who disapproves of the House booting its speaker and failing to elect a replacement. He compared the situation to a “giant freaking circus.”
“They can't even figure out what they want to do as near as I can tell,” Davis, an independent, said. "I'm like you're not leading, you're just running around like kids on a playground. So I've lost a lot of respect for the Republican Party these last couple of years.”
Republican presidential candidates have also spoken out against the move. During a USA TODAY town hall last week in New Hampshire, former Vice President Mike Pence said, “I have some tough words for what I call the 'chaos caucus' in my party on Capitol Hill.”
“It never would have occurred to me to partner with every Democrat on Capitol Hill to oust a Republican speaker of the House,” he said, adding that if lawmakers fail to elect a speaker, voters will hold them "accountable, individually and collectively."
Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had a rocky start to his reign as speaker. He went through 15 rounds of voting to get elected, and had to make concessions with hardline conservatives who opposed him.
But once elected, his detractors' frustrations only grew, particularly during debt ceiling negotiations between McCarthy and President Joe Biden
The boiling point of his speakership hit late last month when McCarthy worked with Democrats to pass a stopgap measure, also known as a continuing resolution, and avoid a government shutdown. 
Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who criticized McCarthy for the measure, introduced a motion to vacate and remove McCarthy as speaker. 
Eight Republicans and 208 Democrats voted to oust him. The list of eight includes Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, Gaetz of Florida, Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Rep. Matt Rosendale of Montana.
At this point, Davis said he just wants lawmakers to elect somebody in the speaker position and get the job of representing their constituents done.
“They need to get their act together. I mean, at this point, they've got the raw voting power. Why not just pick anybody at this point? They don't have to be popular. Just need to put somebody up there who can say, hey, this is what we're voting on next. And just get through it all. I don't care if they choose Jeffries from the Democrats or anybody else for that matter.”
For Kate Richards, a 59-year-old semi-retired entrepreneur in Manchester, New Hampshire, Congress entering its third week without a speaker makes her feel angry.
“It’s dangerous for the country,” Richards, an independent, said. “That is a very important job. He's third in line, nothing's getting done. And again, this is foolishness, and it's making the country at risk whether they understand that or not. It’s a very vulnerable time for us.”
Leo Braham, an 18-year-old who attends Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, said that it is a little disheartening to see the chaos unfolding in the House. He doesn’t care who the speaker is, but said he just wants to see the GOP unified.
“I think what we're seeing in the House is a much deeper and more worrisome reflection of the fractures in the party. And I think as a Republican voter, I want to see much less of that because I care about particular issues actually being acted upon,” he said. “I think it's a lot harder to show unity… I think it's not positive that there's that kind of open rebellion within the caucus.”
Alana Sweeny, a 74-year-old retiree in Mahopac, New York, said that she felt McCarthy’s removal was a reaction by a very small group that wanted to control the House and put a more conservative mark on House matters.
“I think it's extremely unfortunate. We have a lot of important things that need to be taken care of by Congress and right now, we're paralyzed…It makes me frustrated,” Sweeny, a Republican, said. “We have people there who are to do the business of the populace. And at the moment, they're not able to do it until they get a speaker…It's a shame that it's such a small group that's doing that and it's a shame that none of the Democrats will just vote present and get it over with.”
Sweeny said she liked how the former speaker was able to work on both sides of the aisle, understand issues and work with a broad spectrum of individuals.
Rafael Struve, a 31-year-old communications director for the Texas Young Republican Federation based in Houston, Texas, called the decision to remove McCarthy “premature.”
“Especially as we head into the 2024 cycle−if we want to show that we're a party that is going to deliver a better or better policy platform than the Democratic Party, we need to show that we can actually get step one taken care of which is uniting behind whoever is elected leadership is to drive forward what we believe is the agenda that best serve the interests of our country and for us as voters," he said.
Robert Charlebois, a 56-year-old truck driver in Danbury, New Hampshire, said he feels McCarthy’s removal was justified.
“He was given the speakership with the understanding that there were certain goals he was going to pursue, and he didn't do that, and part of the reason he was given the speakership was because he wasn't going to bend to the Democrats to achieve other goals, and yet he did. So what it boils down to the way I'm looking at it, I tried to look at it from all possible angles, is he did not keep his word,” Charlebois, a Republican, said. 
“And so therefore, if you've got someone who promises you the moon, and delivers you a marble then are you going to keep them employed?”
Jared Johnson, a 43-year-old mining industry worker and Republican voter in Tooele, Utah, also said McCarthy didn’t keep his word as speaker.
“I think we've got to get more Republicans on board to…be more conservative,” he said, applauding Jordan for leading the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.
Kevin Fry, a 63-year-old retired air traffic controller in Fort Wayne, Indiana, criticized McCarthy for not getting the appropriation bills finished or scheduling votes on term limits for lawmakers.
“Some things are out of his (McCarthy's) control. But...one person should not have as much power as they physically do and then not use it," Fry, a Republican, said.
Republicans already struggle to hold onto the majority after winning back control of the House from the Democrats in the 2020 midterms with a narrow margin. 
The infighting between Republican lawmakers over the shutdown fight and now the speaker battle have only added pressure to the GOP. In the Yahoo News/YouGov poll, 42% of voters blame conservative and moderate Republicans for the current gridlock in Congress while 32% of voters blame progressive and moderate Democrats.
McCarthy’s removal is a reflection of the political problems the Republican Party faces as it “navigates between trying to be a center-right party who can appeal to moderate voters and a party dominated by the hard-right side of the party,” according to Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The speaker of the House can become a campaign issue, he added. For instance, former Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill “was a major punching bag of Republicans back in the 1980 election, for instance, and that tactic was considered successful.” 
“I can see Democrats having a field day going after House Republicans and perhaps a new speaker, especially if he or she is seen as being extreme,” Stewart III said. “This is not good for Republicans, although they still have time to stanch the wounds.”
However, Wagner said that each district Republicans are competing in is different and the speaker race might not have a huge effect.
“In some districts, there will be a well-funded incumbent, others may be open, making them very different even if they are both purple,” Wagner said. “ If the GOP lags in fundraising, messaging or candidate recruitment, it could help Democratic candidates, but it really depends largely on the district.”
On a national level, Wagner said that an effective presidential campaign at the top of the ticket may well hide some of the problems among House Republicans in Congress.
“However, if the perception of disarray from the House were to paint the entire party, even the Presidential candidate may suffer some vote loss from voters who are frustrated with the entire party,” he said. 
Some 2024 Republican candidates on the campaign trail have called out the divisions between GOP lawmakers in Congress.
Pence said in an interview with USA TODAY that he was concerned about how the chaos on Capitol Hill was affecting America and called on Republican leadership to elect a new speaker.
“I mean, look, we have war now raging in Eastern Europe, war in Israel,” Pence said. “Now more than ever, we need Republicans to come together and elect leadership that can begin to not only provide our allies with the support they need, but secure our border, get our economy moving again." 
Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in an interview with USA TODAY that if lawmakers elect a speaker soon and “show unity in that selection process,” then it's a bump in the road that will not have any impact on next year's election. 
“If we struggle with getting the ballots to select a speaker, then it demonstrates that we're not ready to govern,” Hutchinson said. “So that would be worrisome."
As she filed for candidacy to participate in the New Hampshire Republican primary, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley suggested lawmakers shouldn't get paid until they elect a speaker.
“What I will remind my fellow Republicans is, you don't fix Democrat chaos with Republican chaos. Get it together," she said.
The “deepest, darkest thoughts’’ of Katie Meyer may be relevant in the wrongful death lawsuit her parents filed against Stanford University, a California judge wrote in an order submitted with the Santa Clara County Superior Court.
The Sept. 28 order compels Meyer’s parents, Steve and Gina, to produce a "mirror drive'' containing potentially sensitive information from Katie Meyer's laptop. It also underscores how things have evolved since the former Stanford soccer goalkeeper died by suicide more than a year and a half ago.
On Thursday night, she will be remembered publicly again at Stanford’s campus in California, where she was a captain of the women’s soccer team when she took her life.
A year ago, Stanford bought airline tickets for Meyer's parents so they could fly in from their home in Southern California for the soccer team's mental health awareness match, when their daughter was honored. They have no plans to attend this year's event.
"We were not contacted by Stanford about the game — however, we are heartened to see that since Katie’s tragic passing, there appear to be steps taken by the university to provide mental health and well-being resources for their students, as they are the caretakers of our young people during their lives on campus,'' Gina and Steve Meyer said in a statement provided to USA TODAY. "We have, and always will be, fully supporting the Stanford Women's Soccer Program and the amazing young women of that team.''
Neither lawyers representing Stanford in the matter nor Dee Mostofi, Stanford's assistant vice president for external communications, responded to USA TODAY's requests for comment made by email and phone.
The litigation between the Meyers and Stanford has grown increasingly combative, as reflected by court filings. Both parties, in assigning responsibility for Meyer’s death, have accused the other of breaching duty of care.
Key evidence about why Meyer took her life at 22, just months before she was set to graduate, could be found on the mirror drive of Meyer’s laptop, according to court records.
Meyer’s laptop is relevant because of what her parents say it proves, according to court filings.
Their assertions center around disciplinary action Stanford took against Meyer in 2022, according to court filings. School officials determined Meyer may have acted in retaliation when she spilled coffee on a Stanford football player in 2021.
The unnamed player, who suffered burns on his back that required medical attention, had kissed one of Meyer’s teammates without consent a week earlier, according to the school’s records filed with the court.
On Feb. 28, 2022, the night before Meyer’s body was found in her dorm room, she received an email from Stanford informing her that she was facing a disciplinary charge stemming from the spilled coffee. According to a court filing, a five-page letter sent by email explained her degree was going to be placed on hold less than four months from graduation and the charge could result in her removal from the university.
“Computer forensics shows that Katie frantically toggled back and forth between the letter and the attachments and searching how to defend a disciplinary complaint,’’ according to a court document that noted Stanford's Counseling and Psychiatric Services were closed when Meyer received the email to which she replied she was "shocked and distraught."
“The actions of Stanford and its employees in charging Katie with a violation of fundamental standards over spilling coffee on a Football Player perpetrator of sexual assault without sufficient evidence was reckless, and wrongful and resulted in an acute stress reaction and her impulsive suicide.''
Stanford said the unnamed soccer player who was kissed by the football player without consent did not take the necessary steps to initiate a formal investigation, according to court records.
The school objected after months of delays following the Meyers agreeing to provide the mirror drive. It led to the Sept. 28 order from Judge Frederick Chung of the Superior Court of Santa Clara that the Meyers produce the mirror drive in 30 days.
The Meyers agreed March 10 in responses verified under oath to produce the mirror drive but, according to the judge's order, "then backtracked.''
The Meyers later argued they never agreed to provide an "absolute mirror image of the decedent's computer'' and only "responsive,'' "non-privileged information," according to the order. The judge wrote that argument is "baseless."
“In addition,’’ the judge wrote, “the court finds that a mirror image of Katie Meyer's laptop is directly relevant to the central issues in this case, including Katie's state of mind and her activities on her computer.’’
Meyer's parents say she reported suffering from depression and suicidal ideation at the time she was going through the disciplinary proceeding. According to Meyer's parents, Stanford's handling of the disciplinary process led to Meyer's suicide.
Stanford, in response to the Meyers' complaint, introduced evidence it argues shows Meyer’s parents contributed to her suicide.
In February 2022, six days before Meyer was found dead, she rehearsed in front of teachers an oral presentation she would make to the class about her family relationships before she came to Stanford, according to a court filing.
“The notes taken of what Katie said reveal Katie’s struggles with her parents and their control and pressure to be perfect,’’ Stanford’s attorneys wrote.
Meyer made statements about her mental state during a period that ended before she enrolled at Stanford, according to the school’s filing.
This was cited as part of the school’s contention that Meyer’s parents "breached...duty of care."
Attorney Kim Dougherty, who is representing Meyer's parents, told USA TODAY by email, "While elite athletes and devoted students always endure stress related to their goals, nothing caused Katie to take her life until the night she received the 5 page punitive letter threatening everything she worked so hard for and her entire future."
A suicide note was recovered from the scene, according to the autopsy report, which provides no additional information about the note.
A filing from the Meyers states, “The letter from (Office of Community Standards) was open on Katie’s computer screen at the time of her death."
But a court filing from Stanford stated the suicide note “did not mention the (disciplinary) proceeding or anything related to it.’’
According to the autopsy report, Meyer had been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The report, which cites a medical record review, does not say when Meyer was diagnosed.
At Stanford, she was prescribed Concerta, an ADHD medicine she had been taking since May 2021 to help with issues of concentration, according to a court filing. But she "had issues'' refilling the prescription because of insurance and after November 2021 was unable to get the medicine prescribed again, according to the filing.
The filing states that a sports psychologist and sports psychiatrist at Stanford failed to properly monitor Meyer's refills even though they knew suicidal ideations may be present for months after discontinuation of the medicine. No drugs were found in her body at the time of her death, according to the toxicology report.
In addressing the relevance of the mirror drive, Judge Chung wrote of Meyer’s mental health and mental state, “Those issues have been pushed to the forefront by the Meyers' own allegations…and so the uncomfortable reality is that much of Katie's private life — including her deepest, darkest thoughts — may be potentially relevant to this case.’’
Dougherty, the attorney representing Meyer's parents, said they are prepared to comply with Judge Chung’s deadline to produce the mirror drive by the end of this month.
On Tuesday, as Stanford was preparing for the women’s soccer team’s mental health awareness match, Dougherty said she has been working on an amendment to protect third-party rights in the release of the mirror drive.
"So if there’s friends of (Meyer's) or boyfriends or things like that where they’re talking about their own private information, that’s the area that obviously we want to protect and ensure is protected as required under California law,'' Dougherty said. “That’s what we’re negotiating on with Stanford right now. We are not seeking to hide anything as it relates to the Meyers or Katie. We have nothing to hide.''
There is no information on the setting of a trial date, according to Jessica Kellogg, communications program manager for the Superior Court of Santa Clara County. 
On Thursday night, when Stanford plays Oregon State, Meyer will be recognized in a variety of ways, according to the school.
Stanford’s players will wear T-shirts that bear the slogan “Katie’s Save,’’ a nod to the initiative of Meyer’s parents to require colleges to give students the option to select a designated advocate. They argue it would have saved their daughter.
As they have all season, Stanford players will wear jerseys with a butterfly patch in honor of Meyer. She loved butterflies.

As grief consumed the University of Houston last year, one place on campus became a sanctuary. 
Staff at the LGBTQ resource center, a cozy second-floor office furnished with a red sofa and a shelf full of comfort food, sprang into action after the unexpected death of Corey Sanders, a 23-year-old who helped lead a club for queer and transgender undergrads. 
Sanders loved to sing, said Jamie Gonzales, the center’s former interim director, but he was shy about it. She urged him to step out of his comfort zone and perform at his lavender graduation, a special ceremony for LGBTQ seniors. 
She never got the chance to hear him. Sanders died suddenly from a diabetic coma last October, according to the medical examiner. The university couldn't confirm whether students were officially notified about his passing. 
But at a memorial outside the LGBTQ resource center a few days later, a crowd spilled into the hallway. The center was Sanders’ “second home,” his friend Kaitie Tolman said. 
A year later, that haven of safety and acceptance is gone, too.
As the first anniversary of Sanders’ death approached, the letters L, G, B, T and Q – which adorned the wall outside the door for years – were stripped from the entrance. They came off at the direction of university administrators, who indicated the center would be disbanded after Texas’ Republican governor signed a law banning offices dedicated to “diversity, equity, and inclusion” – or DEI – at the state’s public colleges and universities. 
Earlier this year, Texas and Florida’s conservative governors signed two of the most sweeping anti-DEI bills nationwide into law. The bills, brainchildren of two influential conservative think tanks, were part of a flurry of recent legislation that was shuttled through numerous statehouses in tandem. The effort entrenched college DEI programs as a culture-war issue in American politics.
Unlike the efforts in Texas and Florida, many of the anti-DEI bills introduced across the country didn’t succeed. In other states – including North Carolina, North Dakota and Tennessee – less stringent bans, applying only to mandatory diversity training, passed. 
Yet even those laws are raising questions about how they could affect the lives of vulnerable college students. In the meantime, LGBTQ centers at several colleges across Texas and Florida are being shuttered, with little clarification from college leaders. 
Caught in the crosshairs of it all is a generation of young people, for many of whom getting to college – and staying there – is already a miracle. 
Fighting for LGBTQ+ rights:How a Christian transgender man increased his faith by taking on religious schools
Two years ago, the Office of LGBTQ+ Initiatives and Allyship at Florida Atlantic University was going strong. Its staff were hard at work for their students, helping some figure out how to change their legal names during an April 2021 panel. 
A professor at Florida Atlantic University, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told USA TODAY that in recent months, the university’s resource center “just disappeared.” A web search for the school’s LGBTQ resource center now yields a “page not found” error.
FAU’s communications office did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
In April, Texas Tech’s Office of LGBTQIA Education & Engagement held a party for Lesbian Visibility Day. Just a few months later, its Twitter and Instagram accounts are inactive. Texas Tech’s communications office did not respond to emailed requests for comment. 
There are only about 250 professionally run LGBTQ centers on campuses across the country today, according to the Postsecondary National Policy Institute. That’s just a fraction of the nearly 4,000 colleges and universities in the U.S. The proportion is less than 1%, despite the fact that a fifth of college students surveyed in 2020 by the Association of American Universities said they identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, queer, or questioning.
Institutions in Texas have until January 2024 before the new anti-DEI law can be enforced. Florida’s law, however, took effect in July. The legislation tasked the state’s 17-member Board of Governors, which oversees the public university system, to develop guidelines for implementing it. 
USA TODAY obtained a copy of draft regulations recently sent by the board to public universities for comment. The draft rules, first reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education, do little to clear up any confusion. They continue to define DEI programs as those promoting “differential or preferential treatment of individuals,” including on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. 
The draft regulations were not released publicly, yet another indication of how colleges and universities are quietly grappling with the new rule – a strategy that has, so far, obscured the law’s impacts, according to Carlos Guillermo Smith, a senior policy adviser with the LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Florida. 
Smith said his group has been monitoring the situation. And they’re alarmed by the silence from colleges. 
“These programs exist for a reason,” he told USA TODAY.  
Research shows LGBTQ college students face persistent barriers to getting into college and staying there. Family rejections, an increased likelihood of homelessness and a tougher federal student aid process all contribute to an oppressive environment, said Jason Garvey, an education professor at the University of Vermont. 
“Legal guardians hold a disproportionate amount of power over the lives of queer students,” says a study he and other researchers published last year in the Journal of College Student Development. 
Filling out forms necessary to afford college, such as the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, can pose a major challenge. An analysis of Education Department and survey data indicates that queer and trans students are more likely than their heterosexual peers to have a lower socioeconomic status. 
That’s where LGBTQ centers come in.
If queer and trans get to college, designated safe spaces for them make those students feel safer, according to a 2016 article in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence. And when they feel safer, they’re more likely to stay in school – and graduate. 
“It is through these services and these communities that students are retained academically,” Garvey said. “We need to start treating them for the value that they bring.”
'Completely different from high school:'How colleges are making space for LGBTQ students
When Dane Ashton first learned about the University of Houston center, he had a Sharpie in his hand. 
It was 2016. He was in his freshman dorm room, and his roommate glimpsed him blacking something out from his university ID. The target of his anxious blotting? His legal name. For about a month it had been glaring at him – one of those uncomfortable reminders that can easily become rote, but never stops being painful, for trans people like himself.
Go to the center, he remembered his roommate saying. The staff there would help him make the change.
He took the advice, and by the end of the day, Dane Ashton’s ID said Dane Ashton. 
His situation was a classic example of the type of work Lorraine Schroeder did every day. The University of Houston is a big school, with more than 40,000 students, and bit by bit, the challenges queer and trans young people brought into her office weighed on her. She loved her job, but after more than a decade leading the center, the burden of that work got heavier. She retired in 2021.
“I just emotionally couldn’t take on anymore,” she said. 
Schroeder, who has a master’s degree in clinical psychology, started the center at UH in 2010. Back then, her position as director was just half-time. The then-provost agreed to let her share space with the women’s resource center. 
She had a small budget then, only about $10,000. As far as staff, it was just her, plus a few federal work-study students. 
One of her first ideas was simple. She hosted brown bag lunches on Mondays. They were a way for students to “make connections with other LGBTQ students” or “just hang out with friends,” she wrote in an old funding request.
Ten to 20 students showed up regularly. The lunches were especially important for the freshmen, who often didn’t know any other queer or trans students on campus yet.
Building community – that was priority No. 1. She wanted to create a space where LGBTQ students could “let down their guard.”
“Gender identity, when you’re first trying to figure it out, is a big thing,” Schroeder said. 
Regardless of which pronouns her students wanted to use that day, she honored them. Some tried out different names. As they progressed in their journey of self-discovery, some even volunteered to share their stories – “whichever parts they wanted,” in her words – at events put on by the center. 
Each time they did, they got “more and more in touch with accepting themselves,” she said.
As her students grew, so did the center’s budget. She fundraised and scraped for more money from administrators. Three years in, she was hired full-time. By fiscal year 2016, she had turned that initial $10,000 budget into a roughly $140,000 one, school records show.
Over the years, the center hosted LGBTQ ally trainings for hundreds of people.  Like many other schools, the staff organized a special graduation ceremonies just for queer and trans students. There was even a special library with LGBTQ books.
Then, a few months ago, a decade’s worth of momentum came to a halt.
“In Accordance with Texas Senate Bill 17, the LGBTQ Resource Center has been disbanded,” read a sign posted outside the center in August. 
Outcry rose swiftly. University administrators first said the sign was posted prematurely. Then Daniel Maxwell, the interim vice chancellor for student affairs, confirmed the center would close Aug. 31, along with the university’s Center for Diversity and Inclusion. 
In its place would be a new “Center for Student Advocacy and Community.” Part of the new center’s mission, administrators wrote in aSept. 1 message, would be to “address the wide-ranging needs of our students.” No one appears to have lost their job at the LGBTQ center completely, but five employees were moved into new roles as a result of the change, university spokesperson Shawn Lindsey said in an email.
In a message to students Aug. 23, Maxwell said the university remains committed to supporting students. 
Some of them see it differently. Kaitie Tolman, the president of GLOBAL, the student LGBTQ group on campus, said the university seems to be going overboard to comply with the new law. She’s not alone in that sentiment. 
“These schools are really jumping the gun,” said Johnathan Gooch, a spokesperson for the LGBTQ rights organization Equality Texas. 
Tolman said she and other students met with UH administrators several weeks ago, and she wasn’t satisfied with what she heard. She started a group called “Free U of H,” which is planning a campus-wide walkout later this month to protest administrators’ handling of the closure.
Tolman was close friends with Corey Sanders, the student who died last year. After his sudden passing, she remembers sending an email to the LGBTQ center, asking if she could use their space to plan a memorial. 
Within 15 minutes came a response. She didn’t need to organize anything, the staff said. Give them three days, and they’d handle it all.
Weeks earlier, a similar chain of events had played out on a neighboring campus. In the wake of another student’s death, Rice University’s Queer Resource Center held office hours for people to grieve, according to Cole Holladay, a queer junior who uses they/them pronouns and was friends with Ryan Dullea, the 19-year-old student who died.
Both were chemistry majors. Both were LGBTQ. The two bonded instantly.
“Losing someone I think really reminded me how important it is to create that community,” Holladay said. 
This summer, when Holladay heard UH’s LGBTQ center was closing, they knew they had to do something. So Holladay, the co-president of the university’s LGBTQ club Rice Pride, offered honorary membership not just to UH students, but to students across Texas whose resource centers might be on the brink of closing. 
Unlike at UH, Rice’s center is entirely student-run. And unlike at UH, Rice is a private school, so it’s not affected by the new state law. 
“I’m not quite sure what the game plan is,” said Shane Windmeyer, the founder of the LGBTQ advocacy group Campus Pride. He’s been in touch with schools across both Florida and Texas, he said, who are wrestling with how to save their centers. 
USA TODAY reached out to five public universities in Florida and five in Texas, plus the University of Houston, to ask about the status of their LGBTQ centers. All of them have had designated centers or offices specifically for LGBTQ students. Only a few responded to emailed requests for comment. 
A spokesperson for Texas A&M University, Kelly Brown, said the university is “working toward compliance” with the law before January. Administrators are considering how to support all students including those in the LGBTQ community, before taking any action.
Brian Davis, a spokesperson for the University of Texas at Austin, said in an email the school expects to receive more guidance from the UT system on how to implement the law in the coming weeks. 
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ press secretary, Jeremy Redfern, said in an email the DeSantis administration hasn’t been quiet about its “goal to eliminate DEI from higher education and refocus our institutions on their core mission: pursue truth, promote rigor in academic discourse, and prepare students to be citizens of this republic.”
A spokesperson for Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas did not respond to an emailed request for comment. 
The first LGBTQ center dates back to 1971, according to Campus Pride. More were founded in the ‘90s on the heels of the death of Matthew Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was tortured and murdered in a hate crime 25 years ago this month. It's one of many reasons why October is the month of LGBTQ Center Awareness Day, a holiday that now falls on the same week as the anniversary of Corey Sanders' death.
Shepard’s murder galvanized the LGBTQ rights movement on college campuses, said Jeff Maliskey, the director of the University of North Dakota’s PRIDE Center. Maliskey wrote his dissertation on the history of LGBTQ student activism at his university. 
In North Dakota, queer and trans college students in the 1990s had to organize for their rights, he wrote, “out of necessity,” because his university was failing to protect them from discriminatory laws.
Those circumstances reminded him of the hue and cry across Texas and Florida today. Progress, he said, came only when students pushed for it.
“Students bore that responsibility,” he said. “But where was the institution?”

ORLANDO, Fla. – The city of Orlando plans to purchase the Pulse nightclub, the location of what was once the nation's deadliest mass shooting, in order to expedite the many fitful efforts to build a permanent memorial.
Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, announced the city's intent to purchase the land before beginning work on a memorial for the victims and survivors of the massacre that killed 49 people and injured 53 in 2016.
“Unfortunately it’s been seven years and we’ve not been able to move forward on beginning the construction of a memorial on that site, which I think most people agree is the most appropriate place for it to be,” Dyer said. “We think we were probably the only ones that could step in and at least calm the situation down and make sure that everybody understands that we will in fact build a memorial on that site.”
The proposed $2 million land purchase will go before the city council on Monday, Dyer said.
On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen walked into the gay nightclub and opened fire, killing 49 people and wounded 53 others. It was the nation’s deadliest mass shooting until a year later when a gunman killed 60 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas. Mateen was shot and killed at the scene by Orlando police.
In the seven years since the massacre, efforts to build a memorial have been mired in debate and controversy. The onePulse Foundation, a nonprofit that's led efforts to build a permanent memorial and museum at the nightclub, has been unable to fulfill its proposals. Barbara Poma – who has owned the property with her husband Rosario and businessman Michael Panaggio – stepped down as executive director of the nonprofit last year. Some months ago, she exited the organization entirely, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
The foundation, meanwhile, scaled back plans for a $100 million memorial, citing fundraising challenges.
In a statement emailed to USA TODAY, Deborah Bowie, the executive director of onePulse Foundation, thanked the mayor for advocating a purchase plan.
"We are thankful to the City of Orlando for ensuring that the National Pulse Memorial will be located at the Pulse nightclub site, which was always the hope of families of the 49 victims and the Pulse-impacted community," Bowie said. "We look forward to being a part of the discussion with the City of Orlando as this moves forward."
Brandon Wolf, a survivor of the shooting and an activist, replied to the mayor's announcement on X, saying "Good. It’s time for a permanent space where people can grieve, reflect, and honor those stolen from us. One created by and for the community."
State Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, praised the deal struck between property owners and the city. "This is the right thing to do – the site of Pulse is sacred for so many of us and should not be sold to the highest bidder," she said on X. "I am grateful for the City of Orlando for listening to Pulse families and taking this important step."
In 2021, President Joe Biden signed a law designating the Pulse nightclub in Orlando as a national memorial.
Construction of other permanent memorials commemorating deadly mass shootings in the U.S. has often taken years.
In Newtown, Connecticut, the families of victims and survivors of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting – which killed 20 first graders and six adults – had to wait 10 years for a memorial.
In Aurora, Colorado, an avian-themed memorial opened six years after 13 people were killed in a mass shooting at a movie theater in July 2012.
In June, designers unveiled renderings for a permanent memorial honoring those impacted by the Harvest Festival mass shooting, six years after the October 2017 massacre at the Las Vegas Strip.
Also in June, construction workers broke ground on a permanent memorial dedicated to the lives of the nine members of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, who were fatally shot by an admitted white supremacist in 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina.
Billie Eilish has unveiled a huge new back tattoo.
The "What Was I Made For?" singer, 21, took to Instagram to reveal to her 110 million followers the new tattoo, which extends from the nape of her neck past the small of her back.
The photo sparked curiosity among many social media users who questioned what the tattoo meant.
"Looks like a toddler with a marker went to town…" one user wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
"It looks like it took a while," another user wrote. "It seems like she enjoyed it…kinda seems like she's going through it."
Others seemed to be fans of the new ink.
"Billie Eilish tattoo is fire," a fan gushed.
"Please show us the fully colored in version of your tattoo as it looks absolutely killer," another wrote under the post.
Eilish unveiled the tattoo in the fourth photo of a post on Instagram. She captioned the gallery — which also included photos of her purchasing luggage, a Jack-o'-lantern carved to say "Billie" and a new black and red hairstyle — with the scissors emoji.
Earlier this year, the singer-songwriter pushed back on criticism of her evolving style and choices, saying what others think of her is "not (her) responsibility."
"Let women exist!", Eilish wrote on an Instagram story. "Did you know that women are multifaceted? Shocking right? Believe it or not, women could be interested in multiple things."
Experts say Eilish, along with female stars such as Taylor Swift and Khloé Kardashian, face an unspoken pressure to stay current by reinventing themselves several times, although they also receive criticism for these changes.

"Many feel that multiple different aesthetic eras cannot all be genuine to one person’s true self, so they assume female pop stars are changing purely to fit the times, and not as a means of self-expression," StyleCaster fashion and lifestyle editor Bella Gerard told USA TODAY in May 2021. "Some people might go as far as arguing that staying the same over time is a sign of a male star’s commitment to identity."
Eilish became a breakout star in pop music in her teens thanks to the release of the 2017 EP "Don’t Smile at Me" and her 2019 debut album "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?"
The "Everything I Wanted" artist released "What Was I Made For?," a breathy piano ballad, as part of the "Barbie" soundtrack in July.

In excerpts of her upcoming memoir, shared by People, Britney Spears wrote that she became pregnant with Justin Timberlake’s baby and had an abortion because he wasn’t ready to become a father. 
“Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young,” Spears writes in her book, according to People. "If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father."
“To this day,” Spears continues, “it’s one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life."
Spears’ statements underscore the benefits that male partners receive from having access to abortion care — an often overlooked aspect of reproductive health in light of Roe v. Wade’s downfall last year that, if ignored in society and politics alike, perpetuates the idea that abortion is solely a women’s issue.
“Abortion is a highly stigmatized form of healthcare, and women almost always bear the brunt of the stigma and shame around abortion,” said Bethany Everett, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Utah. “Yet, there are likely many people, including male partners, who don’t want to become parents or have another child, who also benefit from abortion access — benefits that are rarely recognized by the broader public or policy makers.”
Everett, who studies the social and political implications of reproductive health, said Spears' claim that Timberlake did not want to become a parent suggests he was aware that a child could “derail his career,” a reality that “men rarely publicly acknowledge” but is critical to recognize in a post-Roe world. 
(On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, leaving it up to states to determine its legality. Some states have since banned nearly all abortions, while others have passed legislation protecting abortion access.)
Timberlake has yet to publicly respond to Spears’ comments.
Andréa Becker, a medical sociologist and postdoctoral research fellow with the University of California San Francisco’s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health program, said this example is “consistent with the literature,” in that “men don’t necessarily have to come forward and tell their abortion stories if they don’t want to.”
This pattern is due in part to a lack of research analyzing how access to abortion impacts male partners, a shortfall that Becker said “reinforces the way we talk about birth control, condom use and pregnancy avoidance as a woman’s responsibility and issue.”
“We just forget about the sperm involved in creating a pregnancy,” Becker said. 
As a result, stigmas associated with abortion disproportionately impact women.
“Men are rarely acknowledged as beneficiaries from abortion access so it is much easier for them to avoid the stigma and shame around abortion if they don’t think it’s something that impacts them personally,” Everett said. 
Data show that 1 in 5 men in the U.S. have been involved in abortion, which researchers say is likely an undercount. It's estimated that about 1 in 4 women in the U.S. will have an abortion by age of 45, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
The total number of abortions in the U.S. is difficult to measure, but the most recent estimates from 2020 show that there were anywhere between 620,000 to 930,000, according to data from the CDC and Guttmacher Institute. (The number of abortions in the U.S. dropped immediately after the fall of Roe v. Wade.) 
Meanwhile, research has found that some men are hesitant to admit their involvement with abortion. In a 2022 study, men were less likely to disclose the fact they were involved in an abortion during face-to-face interviews compared to an online survey.
In one of the few studies to analyze how abortion impacts male partners, Everett found that men who impregnated someone as a teenager were more likely to pursue post-high school education and graduate from college when the pregnancy ended in abortion compared to those that ended in live birth.
More on maternal health care inequities:Inequities in maternal health care access are not new. They have deep roots in history.
“When men don’t speak up, the burden of having to make decisions about unplanned pregnancies and access to abortion falls exclusively on women — and that’s an equity issue,” said Dr. Brian Nguyen, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. Nguyen runs a research group called the EMERGE Lab that conducts studies aimed at ensuring men recognize their responsibility in women’s reproductive health and gender equity.
While questions still abound about what role male partners should have in the abortion landscape, it’s important to recognize the general lack of knowledge about abortion in the U.S., particularly among some men, Becker said. Consequently, research shows many policy decisions now in place threaten the lives of women and girls who would benefit from abortion care, especially for people of color, migrants, people with disabilities, and those living on low incomes or in rural areas.
"Men do have a place in advocating for reproductive rights,” Everett said. “They can donate to abortion funds and reproductive health care organizations, and, importantly, with the consent of their partners, acknowledge how abortion access has benefited them.”

The USA TODAY Opinion section publishes analysis, argument and essays on a wide variety of subjects. We're looking for timeliness (pegged to news), persuasion pitched to the other side, new information, novel arguments, revelatory insights, passion without partisanship, first-person experience, original reporting that reveals fresh angles and makes news, expert knowledge, and/or a topic that will drive conversation on social media and in the real world.
We accept only pieces that are submitted exclusively to USA TODAY. We do not accept material that has been published on blogs, social media or anywhere else.
Columns typically run 550 to 750 words. They should be pasted directly into an email and sent to theforum@usatoday.com. Pieces should include links (URLs, not headlines or footnotes) to back up quotes and factual material. People featured in columns must be identified by their real, full names.
We do not publish open letters, class projects or material that has been submitted to multiple outlets. Rebuttals to editorials and columns published in USA TODAY should be submitted as letters to the editor, not as full-length op-eds.
Due to the volume of submissions, we can’t respond to all columns sent to us. If our Opinion team is interested in yours, you will hear from us within three business days.
Submissions may be edited for accuracy, clarity, style, standards and length. 
Please include with your submission a short biography, two sentences at most, to run at the end of your column, as well as a current photograph, to which you own publishing rights. If you or a business, trade group or other institution with which you are associated stands to gain financially or in any other way from your column, you should disclose that information in detail. In most cases, it should also be included in the body of the piece or in the author's biographical information.
Columns are accepted for online publication; print publication is not guaranteed. All columns published by USA TODAY are available for use online and in print by the more than 250 properties in the USA TODAY Network. They include Austin; Bergen County, New Jersey; Burlington, Vermont; Cincinnati; Columbus, Ohio; Des Moines; Detroit; El Paso, Texas; Indianapolis; Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Milwaukee; Nashville, Tennessee; Phoenix, Reno, Nevada; Palm Beach, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware.
Authors may post their columns elsewhere 48 hours after they are published at USA TODAY. By submitting a column to USA TODAY and agreeing to its publication, authors are granting exclusive rights to the piece to the USA TODAY Network for 48 hours and non-exclusive rights thereafter.

Corrections to published letters or columns follow USA TODAY guidelines.
