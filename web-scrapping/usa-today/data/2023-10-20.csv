When Angel Amankwaah traveled from Denver to North Carolina Central University for incoming student orientation this summer, she decided she had made the right choice. 
She had fun learning the chants that fans perform at football games. But she also saw that “there are students who look like me, and professors who look like me” at the historically Black university, said Amankwaah, 18, who is Black. “I knew that I was in a safe space.”
This has in the past two years become an important consideration for college-bound students from all backgrounds and beliefs. With so much attention focused on these issues, USA TODAY and The Hechinger Report present the first-of-its-kind College Welcome Guide showing state laws and institutional policies that affect college and university students, from bans on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and “critical race theory” to rules about guns on campus and whether student IDs are accepted as proof of residency for voting purposes.
The digital tables also list, for every four-year institution in the country, such things as racial and gender diversity among students and faculty, the number of student veterans enrolled, the incidence of on-campus race-motivated hate crimes, free-speech rankings and if the university or college serves many students from rural places.
Test our new College Welcome Guide:These tools offer a new lens on campus life.
Students have long picked schools based on their academic reputations and social life. But with campuses in the crosshairs of the culture wars, many students are now also taking stock of attacks on diversity, course content and speech and speakers from both ends of the political spectrum. They’re monitoring hate crimes, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, state abortion laws and whether students like them ‒ Black, rural, military veterans, LGBTQ+ or from other backgrounds ‒ are represented and supported on campus.
“There’s no question that what’s happening at the state level is directly affecting these students,” said Alyse Levine, founder and CEO of Premium Prep, a private college admissions consulting firm in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. When they look at colleges in various states now, she said, “There are students who are asking, ‘Am I really wanted here?’”
For some students on both sides of the political divide, the answer is no. In the chaotic new world of American colleges and universities, many say they feel unwelcome at certain schools, while others are prepared to shut down speakers and report faculty with whose opinions they disagree.
It’s too early to know how much this trend will affect where and whether prospective students end up going to college since publicly available enrollment data lags real time. But there are early clues that it’s having a significant impact.
One in 4 prospective students has already ruled out a college or university for consideration because of the political climate in its state, according to a survey by the higher education consulting firm Art & Science Group.
Among students who describe themselves as liberal, the most common reason to rule out colleges and universities in a particular state, that survey found, is because it’s “too Republican” or has what they consider lax gun regulations, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, restrictive abortion laws and a lack of concern about racism. Students who describe themselves as conservative are rejecting states they believe to be “too Democrat” and that have liberal abortion and gay rights laws.
Sixty percent of prospective students of all backgrounds say new state restrictions on abortion would at least somewhat influence where they choose to go to college, a separate poll by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation found. Of these, 8 in 10 say they would prefer to go to a state with greater access to reproductive health services. (Lumina is among the funders of The Hechinger Report, which produced this story.)
“We have many young women who will not look at certain states,” said Levine. One of her own clients backed out of going to a university in St. Louis after Missouri banned almost all abortions following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, she said.
Institutions in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Texas are the most likely to be knocked off the lists of liberal students, according to the Art & Science Group survey. They’re generally most likely to steer clear of the South and Midwest, while conservative students avoid California and New York.
One in 8 high school students in Florida say they won’t go to a public university in their own state because of its education policies, a separate poll, by the college ranking and information website Intelligent.com, found.
With 494 anti-LGBTQ+ laws proposed or adopted this year, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, prospective students who are LGBTQ+ and have experienced significant harassment because of it are nearly twice as likely to say they don't plan to go to college at all compared with students who experienced lower levels of harassment, according to a survey by GLSEN, formerly the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.
“You are attacking kids who are already vulnerable,” said Javier Gomez, an LGBTQ+ student in his first year at Miami Dade College. “And it’s not just queer students. So many young people are fed up.”
It’s not yet evident whether the new laws are affecting where LGBTQ+ young people are choosing to go to college, said Casey Pick, director of law and policy at The Trevor Project, which supports LGBTQ+ young people in crisis. But LGBTQ+ adults are moving away from states passing anti-LGBTQ+ laws, she said. And “if adult employees are taking this into account when they decide where they want to live, you can bet that college students are making the same decisions.”
Since DeSantis takeover,surge in dropouts at New College of Florida
Meanwhile, in an era of pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion policies in many states, and against affirmative action in college admissions nationwide, Amankwaah is one of a growing number of Black students choosing what they see as the relative security of an HBCU. Enrollment at HBCUs increased by around 3% in 2021, the last year for which the figure is available, while the number of students at other universities and colleges fell. 
“The real attack here is on the feeling of belonging,” said Jeremy Young, who directs the Freedom to Learn program at PEN America, which tracks laws that restrict college and university diversity efforts and teaching about race. “What it really does is hoist a flag to say to the most marginalized students, ‘We don’t want you here.’” 
More than 40% of university and college administrators say the Supreme Court ruling curbing the use of affirmative action in admissions will affect diversity on their campuses, a Princeton Review poll found as the school year was beginning.
College students of all races and political persuasions report feeling uncomfortable on campuses that have become political battlegrounds. Those on the left are bristling at new laws blocking programs in diversity, equity and inclusion and the teaching of certain perspectives about race; on the right, at conservative speakers being shouted down or canceled, unpopular comments being called out in class and what they see as an embrace of values different from what they learned at home.
More than 1 in 10 students at four-year universities now say they feel as if they downright don’t belong on their campus, and another 2 in 10 neither agree nor strongly agree that they belong, another Lumina and Gallup survey found. It found that those who answer in these ways are more likely to frequently experience stress and more likely to drop out.
Military veterans who use their GI Bill benefits to return to school say one of their most significant barriers is a feeling that they won’t be welcome, a survey by the D’Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University found. Nearly two-thirds say that faculty and administrators don’t understand the challenges they face, and 70% say the same thing about their non-veteran classmates. 
Colleges should be “safe and affirming spaces,” said Pick, of the Trevor Project ‒ not places of isolation and alienation.
Yet a significant number of students say they don’t feel comfortable sharing their views in class, according to another survey, conducted by College Pulse for the right-leaning Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at North Dakota State University. Of those, 72% say they worry their opinions would be considered unacceptable by classmates and 45%, by their professors. Conservative students are less likely than their liberal classmates to believe that all points of view are welcome and less willing to share theirs. 
“Is that really an intellectually diverse environment?” asked Sean Stevens, director of polling and analytics at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, which has launched a campus free-speech ranking based on students’ perceptions of comfort expressing ideas, tolerance for speakers and other measures. 
“Anecdotally and from personal experience, there’s certainly a pocket of students who are weighing these factors in terms of where to go to college,” Stevens said.
Eighty-one percent of liberal students and 53% of conservative ones say they support reporting faculty who make comments that they find offensive, the same survey found. It used sample comments such as, “There is no evidence of anti-Black bias in police shootings,” “Requiring vaccination for COVID is an assault on individual freedom” and “Biological sex is a scientific fact.”
A professor at Texas A&M University became the subject of an investigation when a student accused her of criticizing the state’s lieutenant governor during a lecture, though she was ultimately exonerated. An anthropology lecturer at the University of Chicago who taught an undergraduate course called “The Problem of Whiteness” said she was deluged with hateful messages when a conservative student posted her photo and email address on social media.
More than half of all freshmen say that colleges have the right to ban extreme speakers, according to an annual survey by an institute at the University of California, Los Angeles; the College Pulse poll says that sentiment is held by twice the proportion of liberal students as conservative ones.
A group of Stanford students in March disrupted an on-campus speech by a federal judge whose judicial record they said was anti-LGBTQ+. When he asked for an administrator to intervene, an associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion confronted him and asked: “Is it worth the pain that this causes and the division that this causes?” The associate dean was put on leave and later resigned. 
“Today it is a sad fact that the greatest threat to free speech comes from within the academy,” pronounced the right-leaning American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which is pushing colleges to sign on to its Campus Freedom Initiative that encourages teaching students about free expression during freshman orientation and disciplining people who disrupt speakers or events, among other measures.
“I have to imagine that universities that have a bad track record on freedom of expression or academic freedom, that it will affect their reputations,” said Steven Maguire, the organization’s campus freedom fellow. “I do hear people saying things like, ‘I’m worried about what kind of a college or university I can send my kids to and whether they’ll be free to be themselves and to express themselves.’”
Some colleges are now actively recruiting students on the basis of these kinds of concerns. Colorado College in September created a program to ease the process for students who want to transfer away from institutions in states that have banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; Hampshire College in Massachusetts has offered admission to any student from New College in Florida, subject of what critics have described as a conservative takeover. Thirty-five have so far accepted the invitation.
Though many conservative critics of colleges and universities say faculty are indoctrinating students with liberal opinions, incoming freshmen tend to hold left-leaning views before they ever set foot in a classroom, according to that UCLA survey.
Fewer than 1 in 5 consider themselves conservative. Three-quarters say abortion should be legal and favor stricter gun control laws, 68% say wealthy people should pay more taxes than they do now and 86% that climate change should be a federal priority and that there should be a clear path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
Prospective students say they are watching as new laws are passed and controversies erupt on campuses and actively looking into not just the quality of food and available majors at the colleges they might attend, but state politics.
“Once I decided I was going to North Carolina Central, I looked up whether North Carolina was a red state or a blue state,” Amankwaah said. (North Carolina has a Democrat as governor but Republicans control both chambers of the legislature and hold a veto-proof supermajority in the state Senate. 
Florida’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws prompted Javier Gomez to leave his native state and move to New York to go to fashion school. But then he came back, transferring to Miami Dade.
“People ask me, ‘Why the hell are you back in Florida?’” said Gomez. “The reason I came back was that there was this innate calling in me that you have to stick around and fight for the queer and trans kids here. It’s overwhelming at times. It can be very mentally depleting. But I wanted to stay and continue the fight and build community against hatred.”

Thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed and Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate from the northern Gaza Strip ahead of Israel's impending ground invasion, leading to a humanitarian crisis that has brought protests from the United Nations and around the world.
The U.N. said about 1 million Gaza residents have been displaced in just a week, about half of them finding refuge in U.N. schools and other facilities where water supplies are diminishing. The war has claimed more than 4,000 lives since Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack Oct. 7.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization pleaded with Israel on Sunday to immediately reverse evacuation orders for hospitals in northern Gaza, saying the deadlines are impossible to meet and risk additional loss of life. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that attacks on health care facilities are already causing deaths and injuries. 
"The health situation in north Gaza is dire," Tedros wrote on social media. "Evacuation orders by Israel to hospitals are practically impossible to implement and are a death sentence for the sick and injured."
Here are several organizations that are providing aid to people caught in the conflict.
How to cope:The videos out of Israel, Gaza are graphic, but some can't look away
The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) is a coalition of more than 170 nongovernmental organizations that includes tens of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis who share the goal of building peace between the two communities.
"Our members are speaking loudly and clearly about the values that unite our community: Opposition to this horrific violence, and a commitment to Israeli/Palestinian partnership on the path to ending it, and achieving peace and equality," the agency said in a statement.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is a humanitarian organization that aims to protect and aid victims of conflicts. The ICRC has been in Israel and the occupied territories since 1967. The organization is asking for donations to improve access to essential services like water and to support livelihood projects.
Doctors Without Borders is a nongovernmental organization that describes itself as an "independent, impartial and neutral" charity that provides humanitarian aid to people affected by conflict, disease outbreaks and natural and human-made disasters.
The agency is seeking donations to continue to provide medical care in the area. The agency has reported overcrowding in hospitals, a lack of medical supplies, and dangerous working conditions as it tries to support the thousands injured by the fighting.
UNRWA has designated shelters to host the estimated 127,000 people displaced in Gaza. The agency is seeking donations to support its work.
The Jewish Agency for Israel North American Council, an American charity organization, is accepting donations to help victims of terrorism.
Save the Children issued an emergency alert in response to the conflict, noting that escalating violence has left 1.2 million children in need of humanitarian aid. The agency is accepting donations.
National and international organizations that aid victims in the conflict include the Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF), which works to provide lifesaving medical relief and humanitarian aid.
Founded by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, in partnership with Emory University, The Carter Center is a humanitarian aid organization that has been promoting peace and a viable two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades.
After Israel declared war, The Carter Center released a statement condemning the targeting of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and called for international action to end the violence.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden urged Americans in an Oval Office address on Thursday evening to stand with Ukraine and Israel, arguing that U.S. leadership abroad and congressional aid to both countries is essential.
Biden sought to drive home the value of continued U.S. support for the close allies to a war-weary public less than a day after his visit Israel to meet with the country's prime minister. He pressed for the release of hostages that are being held by Hamas and connected the militant group's assault on Israel to Russian President Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine.
"Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: they both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy," Biden said.
He added, "I know these conflicts can seem far away, and it's natural to ask, why does this matter to America."
Speaking from behind the Resolute Desk, the U.S. president said it is vital to America's national security to prevent dictators and terrorists from spreading chaos and destruction.
"They keep going. And the cost and the threats to America and the world keep rising," Biden said. "If we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won't limit himself to just Ukraine."
Biden will detail a request to Congress on Friday to pay for more weapons for Ukraine, buy new equipment for the American military to replace what it has sent Kyiv and replenish the Iron Dome air defense system that protects Israel.
Biden plans to request more than $98 billion in emergency funding for the wars in Israel and Ukraine, U.S. border security and other international crises, according to a source familiar with the funding request who asked for anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.
The source said Biden wants $60 billion for the war in Ukraine, with half of the money going toward replenishing U.S. military stockpiles. Biden is also seeking $14 billion for Israel and $14 billion for the U.S. border as part of the request, which also includes money for the Indo-Pacific and $10 billion for humanitarian assistance.
Biden made the case for the request during a primetime address from the White House. It was only his second speech from the Oval Office as commander-in-chief. The ask amends Biden's previous supplemental request to Congress for more money for the U.S. border and Ukraine's counteroffensive against Russia.
His speech follows a visit to Tel Aviv, during which he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. would make sure sure that the ally has what it needs to defend itself against future attacks.
He arrived at the White House early Thursday morning and spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later in the day.
Earlier this week, long-range missiles that Ukraine had been requesting from the Biden administration showed up on the battlefield in Russian-held territory inside of Ukraine. The U.S. secretly supplied to weapons to Ukraine after Zelenskyy's visit to Washington last month.
As he flew back from Israel, the White House said Biden would make a rare address to the nation on Thursday that outlined the U.S. response to both conflicts. His first Oval Office address came in June after he reached a deal with Congress to avert a default on the nation's debt.
Biden's latest funding request pairs money for Ukraine with assistance to Israel, which is fighting the militant group Hamas.
Thousands of people have died in the conflict that erupted on Oct. 7 when Hamas launched a sudden attack on the Israelis.
At least 32 Americans have been killed, the U.S. president said in Thursday's address. He again pledged to pursue every avenue to bring home U.S. citizens who have been taken hostage, saying he has no higher priority.
"The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure unadulterated evil in the world, but sadly the Jewish people know perhaps better than anyone that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others," Biden said.
Biden drew a distinction between Hamas, which the the U.S. government has for decades deemed a terrorist group, and the Palestinian people, who the Biden administration has sought to provide humanitarian aid. The U.S. president said he was "heartbroken" by the "tragic loss" of Palestinian life in the conflict, including in an explosion in Gaza city earlier this week.
Hamas blamed Israel for an explosion at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of civilians. Israel and the U.S., citing intelligence, have denied the accusation.
Biden said Wednesday as he returned to the U.S. from the Middle East that he had secured an agreement to deliver some aid to the densely populated strip of land that borders Egypt. He said he struck the deal for 20 trucks of aid to be delivered to Gaza during a call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, who he had planned to meet in person in Jordan prior to the blast.
If Hamas does not divert the assistance, Biden said Thursday, the shipments of aid will be sustained.
He said that Israel must also protect civilians and provide the people of Gaza with food, water and medicine and that he discussed the humanitarian relief with Netanyahu during his visit to Tel Aviv.
Biden said he told Israeli leaders about lessons learned by the U.S. after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.
"While we sought and got justice, we made mistakes. So I cautioned the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage," Biden said.
Biden in Israel:President embraces Netanyahu, says Israel must again be 'safe place' for Jewish people
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he doesn’t anticipate a problem with getting support for aid to Israel.
“I think the challenge is determining exactly what that aid consists of because that will be largely determined by the nature of this conflict,” Rubio told reporters Wednesday, before Biden sent Congress his request.
Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said that he looks forward to a supplemental package and would be inclined to support it if there is a border security piece attached that "is real border security and not border facilitation.”
“Like almost every other Republican, I feel strongly that we have to demonstrate that we’re willing to secure our own border if we’re going to ask the taxpayers in this country for more to support somebody else’s,” he said. 
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters Wednesday it is “extraordinarily important” that the United States supports Israel and continues to stand up for Ukraine.
“Russia is watching. The rest of the world is watching and the Ukrainians along with our European allies need that assistance,” he told reporters after a classified meeting with top Biden officials. 
“I think we’ve got to get this full supplemental done as quickly as possible,” he added.
What is Gaza?A look the 140-square-mile strip at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
Getting an aid package through Congress could be an uphill climb, given the chaos that has paralyzed the House of Representatives and the opposition by some Republican lawmakers in the lower chamber to any additional Ukraine assistance.
The chamber has been without a speaker for 16 days since lawmakers ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from the position during a vote triggered by a group of conservative rebels. Republicans have been unable to elect a successor for McCarthy, bringing the business of the House to a standstill. Without a speaker, the House cannot approve critical legislation such as the aid package Biden is requesting to support America's allies.
Further complicating matters: a possible government shutdown in mid-November. A temporary funding bill that has kept government agencies running expires on Nov. 17. Lawmakers must pass another funding bill by then or all government functions will cease except those deemed necessary.
Addressing the calamity in the House, Biden recalled his visit to Kyiv in February, which he said served as a reminder that "America is a beacon to the world, still" and an indispensable nation.
"But time is of the essence. I know we have our divisions at home. We have to get past them," Biden said. "We can't let petty, partisan, angry politics get in the way in our responsibility as a great nation. We can not and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen."
Netanyahu is out, Biden is in:Why Israel is embracing a new 'father figure'
The latest conflict between Israel and Hamas began when the Palestinian militant group staged a surprise attack in southern Israel nearly two weeks ago.
Crossing the border into several towns, Hamas fighters kidnapped and killed more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers and took at least 199 hostages, including some U.S. citizens. One of the most broad-scale assaults in recent memory, the attack caught Israel off guard and arrived on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip have launched rockets every day since, aiming at cities across Israel.
Israel responded by hitting Gaza with a series of airstrikes that the Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry says have killed 2,800 people. Israel also has been setting the stage for a ground invasion that could begin any day.
The U.S. fears that other countries and militant groups could get pulled into the conflict, causing it to engulf the Middle East.
Antisemitism, racism and Islamophobia are also intensifying in the U.S., Biden said on Thursday evening.
Biden invoked the fatal stabbing of 6-year-old Palestinian American Wadea Al-Fayoume in Illinois. The Department of Justice has opened a hate crimes investigation in the attack on the boy and his mother, Hanaan Shahin, who police say were attacked by their landlord.
"To all you hurting, those of you hurting, I want you to know I see you, you belong. And I want to say this to you: you're all American," Biden said.
The White House said that the president and first lady called the boy's father and uncle after Biden's national address.

Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of death.
JERUSALEM − They don't agree on a lot of things. They agree on this: what they have seen and had to do, no one should have to see or do.
Two weeks into the conflict that began when members of Hamas massacred civilians in rural communities and at a music festival on Israel's border with the Gaza Strip, Israelis and Palestinians have been collecting, weeping over and burying their dead with as much dignity as they can in trying, unpredictable and dangerous circumstances.
In Israel, where some 1,400 civilians and soldiers have died and where all Jews are by religious tenet supposed to be buried immediately after death − a few days at most − this has involved emergency responders going to great lengths to recover victims which they have discovered in scenes of unspeakable horror, sometimes in locations where fighting is still taking place.
In Gaza, where at least 3,500 Palestinians have been killed and large parts of the territory controlled by Hamas is in ruins as a result of Israel's bombing campaign, this has meant families resorting to makeshift graveyards dug in empty lots and authorities storing bodies in ice cream freezers as morgues run full, doctors and witnesses say.
'I won't condemn Hamas':Some Palestinians find it hard to denounce attacks on Israel
"I'm not eating. I'm not sleeping," said Israeli search and rescue volunteer Yossi Landau, 55, as he struggled not to weep Wednesday recounting some of what he witnessed in villages in southern Israel in the immediate aftermath of the nation's deadliest ever attack.
Meanwhile, in Gaza, photographer Ali Jadallah said "we have reached a catastrophic situation," where Israel's bombs are killing scores of Palestinian families − sometimes entombing them in their collapsed homes; sometimes leaving their mutilated bodies scattered among the ruins.
On both sides of the Israel-Gaza border, faith traditions define the rules of burial. For Jews, who believe the dead must be watched until buried, and that every part of a body must be buried, the idea of an unguarded corpse is an almost unthinkable lapse. Within the Muslim tradition, the body is wrapped in a shroud and the head is positioned to face Mecca with the eyes and mouth closed.
Jadallah said he's lost nine family members to Israeli airstrikes, according to updates he's been posting on his Instagram account. He filmed himself this week as he was driving in his car. Across the back seat his father, killed in one of those Israeli strikes, lay dead.
Biden embraces Netanyahu:U.S. president says Israel must again be 'safe place' for Jewish people
"We have no funeral cars, no ambulances," he said.
"I'm taking him alone (to bury him). I know people can't attend the funeral. No one can. But please pray for him. He was a decent and beloved man."
In Israel, Landau works for ZAKA, a volunteer organization whose members are almost all ultra-orthodox Jews. Its mission is to collect the remains of the dead, including their blood if they can, so they can be buried in accordance with Jewish religious law.
For the past three decades, Landau has deployed for ZAKA all over the world. He was in New York during the 9/11 attacks. He has responded to natural disasters in India. He has rushed many times to the scene of suicide bombings to collect body parts.
He helped recover the dead in Surfside, Fla., when a 12-story condominium building collapsed early in the morning of June 24, 2021, causing the deaths of 98 people.
Israel-Hamas war:She spent her life advocating for Palestinian rights. Then Hamas came
Yet Landau said that what he encountered in several of the kibbutzim that dot the frontlines where Israeli civilians and soldiers were killed by Hamas on Oct. 7 was more than he could bear.
"I broke. I blanked out," he said.
Landau said that in one home, in Kibbutz Be'eri, he saw small children as young as six with their hands tied behind their back in the same room where their parents were also executed. They were missing fingers and eyes. In another home, he found a pregnant woman lying face down in a pool of blood. When Landau and other ZAKA volunteers turned the woman over, they found her belly had been "butchered open" and the unborn child connected to her had been stabbed.
"I don't know if you know − and you should never know − what it means to separate parts of a burned body," he said, referring to the charred remains of people he came across in vehicles and safe rooms in Be'eri and other kibbutzim in the days after Hamas' assault.
The killing scenes Landau described were corroborated by half a dozen other ZAKA volunteers who were present in Be'eri and elsewhere with him as part of their emergency response.
Cell phone videos, security footage, photographs from residents and accounts of witnesses who survived the initial attacks have also helped establish with some specificity the brutality of the Hamas attacks on civilians on Israel's southern border.
ZAKA volunteers are generally prohibited, as a matter of religious custom, from photographing the work they do. However, Israel's military has asked them to document it as part of the process of collecting evidence and in case it is helpful in identifying remains.
A ZAKA volunteer named Nachman Dickstein who was with Landau in Be'eri showed USA TODAY photographs that further corroborated his grisly accounts of the murdered Israelis. And last week, USA TODAY visited an Israel Defense Forces base on the outskirts of Jerusalem where a rabbinate unit of Israel's military has been working to identify the remains of victims, including women, children and infants after ZAKA volunteers delivered them there from communities in Israel's south.
Hamas attacks:How Israeli police are trying to find the gunmen
On the grounds of the base were a series of refrigerated trucks and shipping containers. Inside were dozens of filled body bags of various sizes − some very small.
Palestinian Muslims and Christians, like Jews, believe that the the body of the deceased should be buried as quickly as possible, ideally within 24 hours of death.
The bereaved family typically hosts a meal and opens their home for three days for guests to visit and share their condolences. Unsweetened bitter coffee is served.
Friends and family recount the life and qualities of the person deceased.
In Gaza, there is now little capacity to observe these rituals.
After Jadallah drove his father's body to a private burial site, for example, he went straight back to work, he said in a brief interview Thursday. One of the first photos he took was of a paramedic performing CPR on a wounded man. Jadallah's Instagram feed is filled with increasingly apocalyptic images of bombed out and smoldering homes, mosques, schools and even hospitals.
At least 16 Palestinian journalists have been killed since Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, a non-governmental professional organization.
"Who kills babies, who kills babies − free world, where are you?" a doctor at the European Gaza Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, pleaded Thursday in a video circulated by health officials and journalists in Gaza.
He stood in front of a medical stretcher on which lay six precious bundles. Bloodied, bandaged and lifeless, their tiny bodies were covered in a fine gray dust from the exploded concrete and brick that killed them.
Still, while the corpses in Gaza are piling up, it's too dangerous to hold funerals and the Palestinian enclave on the Mediterranean Sea is now running out of body bags, according to the United Nations.
Riham Al Qeeq, 40, a mother of four, said that her cousin was buried in a mass grave after after a deadly blast at the crowded Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday.
She said she wasn't able to participate in a brief ceremony at the site marking the deaths because she was worried about the safety of her family and had decided to flee south, close to Gaza's border with Egypt.
The increasing number of dead also means that people are having to bury their loved ones in ad hoc burial sites, according to Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the director general of Al-Shifa hospital there.
Abu Salmiya spoke to USA TODAY briefly on Thursday as he sought to juggle the round-the-clock needs of patients, a hospital facing critical shortages − medicine and clean drinking water among them − and a desire to keep the world informed about the scale of humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Communication into and out of Gaza is also exceptionally difficult because of diminishing electricity and virtually no internet access.
Abu Salmiya said that after the Al-Ahli hospital bombing, his medical facility, a few miles away, received "hundreds of bodies" that "were burned and mutilated and couldn’t be identified" while others were in critical-to-very-critical condition.
Thirty people, he said, were operated on without any anesthetic.
"For those that were killed we had to make a quick decision," he added.
"We had to bury them in mass graves so we don't face the spread of disease and also because they were either unidentified bodies or had no one to come and collect them."
WASHINGTON - After Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was ousted as speaker earlier this month, acting speaker Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., was chosen from a succession list to be the interim, or temporary, speaker.
McHenry started serving in Congress when he was just 29 years old. He’s since taken on several leadership roles and is seen as a moderate Republican compared to some of his colleagues in the House.
Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, D-Mo., who arrived in Congress at the same time as McHenry, recalled McHenry’s progression as a lawmaker in an interview with Roll Call.
“When he first arrived, he was seen as a bomb thrower and someone who was looking for a fight,” Cleaver told the outlet. “He was the Freedom Caucus before there was a Freedom Caucus. Today, I read him as a person who really would like to work with others, who would like to work with Democrats.”
Here’s a closer look at McHenry’s experience and voting record.
McHenry is serving his 10th term in Congress and represents the 10th congressional district in North Carolina. He is a McCarthy ally and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, a role that helped him negotiate the debt limit deal earlier this year.
He was appointed in 2015 by then House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., to serve as the Chief Deputy Whip, helping Scalise build agreement around a conservative policy agenda for the House Republican Conference. 
Mark Harkins, a senior fellow at the Government Affair Institute at Georgetown University, told USA TODAY, that “McHenry has been an important asset to former Speaker McCarthy, having helped broker the deal with rebels in January to allow McCarthy to become Speaker.”
“In addition, he was one of two Republican members McCarthy tapped to negotiate the debt limit deal with administration officials earlier this year,” he said.
One of the top issues surrounding the government shutdown fight last month was whether the U.S. government should give more aid to Ukraine. McHenry has previously supported measures to fund Ukraine's military defense.
For instance, he voted in favor of the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 and the  Ukraine Security Assistance and Oversight Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2023. He said last year that “First and foremost, the U.S. must maintain a firm, long-term commitment to cutting off Russia from global trade and financial markets.”
On abortion, McHenry applauded the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year and said in a statement that it was “an important step forward to protect the right to life.”
“Today’s decision also marks a return to our constitutional norm of rights and powers being reserved to the states, and a federal government of limited and enumerated powers,” he said.
He’s also voted in favor of an amendment to reduce foreign assistance to certain countries based on the number of unaccompanied noncitizens who entered the US from those areas, a veterans benefit improvement act and a Native American child protection act, according to his website.
In 2018, former President Donald Trump said that McHenry had “the greatest name in politics.” He’s also endorsed McHenry previously for Congress.
McHenry said in a statement on the day of the Jan. 6, Capitol attack, that he supported Trump in both the 2016 election and the 2020 election.
“President Trump achieved historic tax cuts, repealed the core of Obamacare and Dodd-Frank, fought unfair trade practices of China, and defended our most sacred ally Israel. I supported and worked to pass his agenda every step of the way—voting with President Trump more than any other member of North Carolina’s Congressional delegation. It was his leadership that brought us the best economy of the last 50 years.”
However, he also said he could not violate his oath of office and was one of the lawmakers who voted to certify President Joe Biden’s 2020 election win.
When asked about Trump’s 2020 election indictment, McHenry told The Charlotte Observer that, “What we don’t want in America is a two-tier system of justice, where a former president, or the son of a president, or a president is treated differently.”
Six weeks before Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel, a deputy political advisor in the group did an interview with a Lebanese news outlet. Tucked into it was a specific warning.  
“We are preparing for an all-out war,” Saleh al-Arouri said of Hamas. “We are closely discussing the prospects of this war with all relevant parties.” 
At the time, his statements were couched as a caution. Israel had plans including targeted killings of leaders of the Palestinian resistance group that controls Gaza, he said. If it followed through, Arouri warned, “a regional war” would ensue.  
Those Israeli provocations never happened. Yet by mid-October, an all-out war was under way. Hamas led a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,300 people including more than 30 Americans and taking at least 200 hostages, and a mounting response from Israel now brings more bloodshed.   
Already, Israel has struck a range of targets, and by mid-week announced at least six key Hamas operatives had been “eliminated.” 
But Israeli authorities also have launched an international manhunt for another Hamas leader, USA TODAY has learned: Saleh al-Arouri.  
They’re pursuing him not just for his insider knowledge of the attack, but for his ties to others – possibly those “relevant parties” he cited in August.  
The attack went far beyond what was expected from Hamas alone: A mass border invasion. Drones and paragliders. Withering rocket fire. Precise raids on military surveillance, communications and intelligence hubs. Those plans bear the hallmarks of sophisticated backers from the outside.  
Current and former intelligence officials say Arouri sits at a strategic intersection of three entities: Hamas; Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based terrorist group that is considered the world’s most formidable; and Iran, the world’s deadliest state sponsor of terrorism. 
If Iran and Hezbollah were involved in the Oct. 7 attack – as security authorities now suspect – someone from Hamas coordinated their assistance. And current and former U.S. and Israeli intelligence officials, and a USA TODAY review of government documents and court records, all point to Arouri as a key link.  
"Today most of the money that is going to Hamas is coming from Iran, and with the money comes the influence too," said Ehud “Udi” Levy, who served for more than 30 years in Israeli intelligence, including as head of the Mossad’s Economic Warfare Division that goes after terrorists' money. "And the Iran man inside Hamas is Saleh al-Arouri." 
More:Is Iran behind Hamas terrorist attacks? What it would mean for US and Middle East security
While experts said they do not yet know what specific role Arouri might have played on Oct. 7, they see him at the heart of a changing − and alarming − dynamic in which these three U.S.-designated terrorist entities are teaming up and further destabilizing the Middle East under the direction of Tehran.  
“With him, I cannot go into details about the involvement,” Danny Danon, an Israeli lawmaker who sits on the Knesset foreign affairs committee, told USA TODAY this week when asked about Arouri. “But I can tell you that Iran is heavily involved with everything that's happening in Gaza – the training, equipment, funding and method of fighting,”  
“We have knowledge of collaboration between Tehran, Beirut and Gaza,” said Danon, who was also Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations. “We are worried that the technology came from Tehran to Beirut and to Gaza.”
And Arouri, he said, “was heavily involved in that triangle.” 
Arouri was a founding commander of the the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas that carried out the attacks.  
Despite having spent years under U.S. terror sanctions, and with a $5 million State Department bounty on his head, he has traveled the region, including in and out of Iran, and collaborated with terrorist figures including the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Qasem Soleimani, before he was killed by a U.S. airstrike. 
And Arouri helped build and lead a new Hamas coalition with Iran and Hezbollah that so alarmed Israel, it sought emergency help from the United Nations Security Council in 2017 and again in 2018 to stop him.  
Arouri is based in Lebanon, where numerous media reports say Hamas leaders met with top Iranian and Hezbollah officials as recently as April. Now, he’s a prime target as Israel seeks out the strategists behind Oct. 7. 
But even after being watched by international authorities for decades, Arouri might not be easy to catch or kill. 
“They are looking for him like the Americans were looking for Bin Laden" after Sept. 11, Levy said. "He is a shadow guy. He is under the radar. And believe me, these are the dangerous people, people like that." 
Publicly, Israel is pointing the finger at more well-known Hamas figures based in Gaza, including Yahya Sinwar and military chief Mohammed Deif. 
“Yahya Sinwar, the ruler of the Gaza Strip, decided on this horrible attack, and therefore he — and the entire hierarchy under him — are dead men," Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said Oct. 12 in his first public statement since the war began. “We will attack them, we will dismantle them, dismantle their system.” 
Arouri lacks the same profile. One of his current titles is deputy chief of Hamas’ political bureau, but sources say Arouri’s role in Hamas has become much more prominent than that. In addition to still playing a role in the Qassam Brigades, Arouri has spent years helping rebuild Hamas operations in the other Palestinian territory blockaded by Israel, the West Bank, according to former Israeli and U.S. counterterrorism officials who have tracked him.  
And, they say, he acts as a chief deputy of sorts to Ismail Haniyeh, one of several Hamas leaders based in Qatar as they try to do political outreach for the group, including to Iran and Hezbollah. 
Five days after the attacks, Arouri offered Al Jazeera Arabic some of the first inside details about the operation, including how 1,200 members of the Qassam Brigades had been given “detailed instructions” about their targets, the Israeli military’s Gaza Brigade, just across the border from the Gaza Strip. 
“We were surprised that the Gaza Brigade collapsed in less than three hours, faster than we expected,” Arouri said.  
Officially, Iran has denied playing a role in the attack even as it congratulates Hamas. President Joe Biden told 60 Minutes on Oct. 15 that there’s no evidence “at this point” that Iran was behind the attack. Israeli officials have made similar comments, stressing that the investigation is in its early stages. 
But U.S. and Israeli intelligence analysts say that if anyone could give the group the ability to launch such stunning land, air and sea attacks against the Israeli military, it would be Iran and its Revolutionary Guard. Even as the hunt for Arouri continued this week, Iran and Hezbollah both raised prospects of openly entering the conflict to respond to Israel’s strikes at Gaza. 
Arouri’s role as an alliance-builder among terrorist organizations has been known to Israel since at least 2018. And his role in raising money and plotting terrorist attacks for Hamas has been known to both governments for a generation.
“It's not just the guys who pulled the trigger or approved the battle plan or gave the final order to do it but the people who are directing all of the strategy and really promoting the (anti-Israel) militarism,” said former FBI counterterrorism analyst and U.S. Treasury terror finance official Matthew Levitt. “And that's Saleh al-Arouri.” 
Yet he has evaded authorities for years.  
“He knows that if he steps anywhere close, we will kill him,” a former top Israeli intelligence official until earlier this year told USA TODAY. "He was on the run. You can imagine that there were several plans regarding that, but it just didn't happen.”  
Born in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Arouri became a fixture in pro-Palestinian activity in the mid-1980s at Hebron University, where he studied Sharia, or Islamic law. 
Security officials in Israel and the U.S. say Arouri joined Hamas soon after it was formed in late 1987 at the beginning of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising. He quickly graduated from being a leader of its on-campus youth organization to founding the Qassam Brigades in the name of establishing an Islamic Palestinian state in place of Israel. 
By the early 1990s, the Qassam Brigades began conducting anti-Israel attacks in the Palestinian territories and in Israel, U.S. and Israeli documents and interviews show. Those included large-scale bombings and rocket attacks, according to the U.S. Directorate of National Intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center, which it oversees.  
In 2003, the Justice Department named Arouri as an unindicted co-conspirator in a racketeering case against three Hamas operatives in Chicago who were charged with financing terrorism. In the indictment, Arouri was described as a high-ranking Hamas military leader who had received tens of thousands of dollars for terrorist activities including buying weapons.  
But Arouri was being investigated by the U.S. even before then.  
“The U.S. government has been aware of Arouri since the late 1990s when he was senior activist in the West Bank,” said Levitt, who worked at the FBI from 1998 to 2001. 
Israeli authorities detained and incarcerated Arouri three times, though he continued his Hamas activity even while in an Israeli prison in Ashkelon, the Justice Department indictment alleged. 
Arouri was arrested again in 2007 but freed in 2011 when Israel released more than 1,000 prisoners in exchange for an Israeli soldier who had been captured by Hamas in 2006.  
All told, Arouri ultimately spent about 15 years in Israeli prisons, Levy, Levitt and others say.  
Upon his final release, he was forced out of Gaza for being a continuing threat to Israel and moved to the Syrian capital of Damascus to join Hamas leadership in exile there.   
With the outbreak of civil war in Syria, Arouri was on the move again. He spent time in Turkey, where he began building an operational Hamas presence, in Qatar, where Hamas’ political leadership resided, and Lebanon. 
In 2014, Arouri announced that Hamas was responsible for a June 2014 terrorist attack that included the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, one of which was dual U.S.-Israeli citizen Naftali Fraenkel, the State Department said. He publicly praised the murders, which sparked Hamas’ month-long war with Israel that year, as a “heroic operation,” State Department documents show. 
With his alleged involvement of the murder of a U.S. citizen, Arouri was high on the U.S. government’s list of terror targets. 
In September 2015, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned him as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, saying he served as “a key financier and financial facilitator for Hamas military cells.”  
U.S. documents in support of that action say Arouri directed Hamas’ military operations in the West Bank, and that he had been linked to several terrorist attacks, hijackings, and kidnappings. 
In June 2017, Qatar expelled six Hamas members, including Arouri, the State Department said in its annual Country Reports on Terrorism. The move came amid intense pressure on Qatar by Washington to crack down on its longstanding role in providing safe haven for terrorists. 
Two months later, Arouri was instrumental in patching up relations between Hamas and Tehran.  
Iran’s history of providing money, weapons, training and technological support to Hamas actually goes back to the early 1990s, said Jonathan Schanzer, a former Treasury Department terror finance analyst and author of four books on Middle East politics.  
Arouri “put to rest” a feud with Iran over the civil war in Syria and began to forge closer links with Hezbollah from his new base of operations in Lebanon, said Schanzer. 
In November 2018, the U.S. State Department’s Rewards for Justice program offered up to a $5 million bounty for information on Arouri.  
At the time, the State Department said, Arouri was “currently living freely in Lebanon, where he reportedly is working with Qasem Soleimani, leader of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force.” 
Israel was so alarmed by these developments that Danon, as its ambassador to the United Nations, sent two urgent requests for intervention, the first in 2017, to the president of the UN Security Council.  
“The increasing cooperation between Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran constitutes a major threat not only to Israel but to the stability and security of the entire region,” Danon wrote in his May 11, 2018 follow-up letter, a copy of which was obtained by USA TODAY.  
The new alliance, including meetings of top operatives and pledges of mutual support, Danon wrote, was being led by Arouri and Saeed Izadi, head of the Palestinian Branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force.  
Hamas also was building its own military force covertly in Lebanon, Danon wrote, warning that it by then had built the infrastructure it needed to manufacture its own missiles and drones. 
In the recent past, one of Arouri’s jobs has been to bring Hamas fighters from the Qassam Brigades to Lebanon for specialized training, Danon said in an interview this week.  
Arouri now travels to and from Iran but mostly stays in Lebanon, where Hezbollah’s power as a political and military force provide him with protection, former security officials told USA TODAY.  
Asked if Israel knows his current whereabouts, Danon said: “I cannot comment on that.”  
On Oct. 7, the kind of weaponry Danon warned about – including drones – figured in the sophisticated Hamas attack, launched from Gaza. As Hamas forces raided Israeli towns, one of their first targets was the coastal city of Ashkelon, where Arouri had spent so many years in jail.   
In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, the FBI and other U.S. agencies have joined Israel in its response – and its investigation, according to Attorney General Merrick Garland and other Biden administration officials. 
That includes the hunt for at least 13 Americans who may be still held hostage by Hamas, the dragnet for Hamas foot soldiers believed to be hiding inside Israel and the broader investigation into who orchestrated and led the sophisticated invasion, two U.S. intelligence officials told USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing investigations. 
If the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S. are any guide, it could be months or even years before authorities answer those questions in detail.  
Iran has signaled a more aggressive approach to Israel, including a warning this week about potential Iranian action against Israel for its response in Gaza. Hezbollah has issued similar warnings. 
Iran’s suspected involvement in the planning of the Gaza raid has been widely reported. Gen. Esmail Ghaani, who is in charge of supervising Iran’s network of proxy militias as head of the country’s paramilitary Quds Force, repeatedly traveled to Lebanon for covert sessions with leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, the New York Times reported from the region.  
Iran also has supported Hamas militarily, it said, “and has helped it design and produce a domestic missile and rocket system to match the capabilities and material available in Gaza.”  
And Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah “held an hourslong online meeting in March with an elite group of strategists from all the Iran-backed militias and told them to get ready for a war with Israel with a scope and reach — including a ground invasion — that would mark a new era,” the Times reported, citing two participants from Iran and Syria.  
But media coverage has not yet focused on Arouri’s role in those relationships.  
Neither did senior Trump administration Iran official Richard Goldberg when he mentioned the existence of a Lebanon-based intelligence center for the three groups during a public event Monday.
Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah, Goldberg said, “have coordinated a fusion cell in Beirut since 2021 where they put everybody together in a war room, an intel room operations room, they go in and out of Lebanon… and they coordinated it all.” 
The former top Israeli security official confirmed to USA TODAY the existence of the joint Iran-Hezbollah-Hamas intelligence center in Beirut.
“They have representatives there, they coordinate their actions, they share information, they share intel. The purpose of that, of course, is to enhance their joint capabilities,” the former official, who left Israeli government earlier this year, said in an interview.
Asked if Arouri played a role in the center, the official said, “Yes of course. I'm not sure if he is the person that is representing (Hamas) there but clearly he has participated in joint meetings over there.”
Goldberg, the Director for Countering Iranian Weapons of Mass Destruction for the White House National Security Council from 2019 to 2020, said he believed the strong cooperation between Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah helped them keep the plot away from Israeli intelligence, just like al-Qaeda kept the 9/11 plot away from the U.S. 
“And so if you don't have any intel on the planning of the attack, it stands to reason you have no intel on Iran's involvement in said attack plans,” Goldberg said. “Of course you don't have the intel. You’re not going to find the intel. There was no intel (because) there was a catastrophic intelligence failure.” 
Rep. Brad Schneider (D-IL), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also said all signs point to Iran, given its role in funding, training and equipping Hamas fighters. 
“If you breed an attack dog, you train an attack dog, you equip an attack dog, maybe you're surprised that the dog breaks through the fence and attacks, but you're still responsible for that attack,” Schneider said. “And Iran has been training Hamas, has been equipping Hamas, funding Hamas, and this has the fingerprints of (Iran) training and planning all the way through.” 
The hunt for Arouri may reveal more of those plans, but for now, he appears only in his media statements.  
Speaking to Al Jazeera, just after the attack, he described his view of the Israeli response to come. 
"The occupation knows that its invasion of Gaza will turn the battle into a catastrophe for its army,” he said, according to a Palestine Chronicle translation. “Before our operation began, the defensive plan was ready, and it is much stronger than the offensive plan. ... We do not see a future for this battle except victory." 
Janita “Gigi” Hayes first started using hair straightener as a child because it made her feel prettier. As she got older, Hayes, who is Black, continued to turn to them because she felt employers perceived her as more professional when her hair was straight.
Now, Hayes is one of thousands of women who blame hair straightening products for damaging her reproductive health and is among those suing their manufacturers. She said she believes long-term use of the products caused her to develop uterine fibroids, a condition that forced her to undergo a hysterectomy.
“I never realized that long term use would affect me like this ... my body is changed forever," said Hayes, 41, of Birmingham, Alabama. "I no longer have the parts that I was born with. The confidence that I had as a woman is no longer there.”
This week, the FDA said it will investigate the products, which research has connected to an increased risk of some types of cancer.
Danielle Ward Mason, Hayes’ lawyer, said the FDA’s decision to turn its attention towards the products is “a huge deal."
“It's about time that someone, a regulatory body, is looking at the dangers of these products,” he said.
The FDA proposed a rule that would ban formaldehyde and other formaldehyde-releasing chemicals from being used in hair-smoothing and straightening products sold in the United States. The products have been used most extensively by Black women. 
On hair treatments, the ingredients show up as formaldehyde, formalin or methylene glycol, according to the FDA, and are found in some hair relaxers and keratin treatment products.
Using the chemicals has been linked to long-term health concerns, such as increased risks of cancer, and can cause short-term risks such as breathing problems, the agency said.
Cancer concerns:FDA proposes ban on hair-straightening, smoothing products over cancer-causing chemicals
The FDA is soliciting public comment about the proposal, but it could be months before anything is decided. The comment period typically lasts at least 60 days, though some have been as short as 10 days or as long as nine months.
If the agency issues a final rule, it is published in the Federal Register along with an explanation of regulatory requirements, the industrial impact of those requirements and any response to public comments. The regulatory requirements also are published under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
Former FDA associate commissioner Peter Pitts said federal law grants the agency oversight of some cosmetic products.
If the administration moves forward with its proposal, Pitts said the products could be removed from shelves within days, though it could take much longer. It all depends on how aggressive the new rule is, he said.
Links between hair dye and chemical straighteners and an increased risk of breast cancer were made in a 2019 study published in the International Journal of Cancer.
In 2022, the National Institutes of Health published a study that found women who used hair-straightening chemicals had a higher risk of developing uterine cancer, and that Black women may be more affected because they use the products at a higher rate.
Earlier this year, U.S. Reps. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, wrote a letter to FDA Commissioner Robert Califf asking the agency to investigate the matter.
"We urge the FDA to investigate the potential health threat posed by chemical hair straightening products," the letter said. "Consumers need to be reassured that the cosmetic products they use do not threaten their health. It is critical that the agency act quickly to address these legitimate concerns."
Pressley called the FDA's proposed rule a win for public health "especially the health of Black women, who are disproportionately put at risk by these products as a result of systemic racism and anti-Black hair sentiment.”
Over time, some women who once felt reliant on the hair relaxers and straightening products gave them up, said Sam Ennon, 79, of San Mateo, California, in part because they can cause breakage and bald spots, and in part because society became somewhat more accepting of Black women’s natural hair.
Ennon, the founder and president of the Black-owned Beauty Supply Association, said he’s been working in the cosmetics industry for 20 years, including stints at Clairol and Worlds of Curls.
He said hair straightening tools, such as an electronic flat iron or hot combs, can achieve similar looks, though they don’t last as long as relaxers do.
After she had uterine fibroids surgically removed, Brown, the congresswoman from Ohio, said she no longer relaxes her hair and wears wigs or braids instead. 
“We are, as Black women, under a lot of pressure to wear our hair a certain way,” she said. 
Proposed federal legislation called the CROWN Act, versions of which have been adopted by several states, would prohibit discriminating against a person for their hair or hairstyle based on race or national origin. A federal bill, sponsored by Rep. Bonnie Coleman, D-N.J., passed in the House in 2022 but has not been reintroduced this session of Congress.
Brown was among the bill’s sponsors.
“I wear my hair in braids,” she said. “That was something important for me to put on display because of the public pressure many Black women receive to wear their hair.”

ARLINGTON, Texas – Postseason baseball is not supposed to be like this.
In a sport where you can’t simply go one-on-one, where a pitcher may simply choose not to throw you the ball in a spot you can hit it, where solid contact and 100-mph line drives are no guarantee of success, one player cannot determine the outcome of a game, the fate of a team.
Yet night after night, series after series and now year after year, Yordan Alvarez is the body around which the Houston Astros rotate, digging them out after they fall into a hole, influencing outcomes even when he’s two, three or four spots away in the lineup.  
They are now two games away from a third consecutive World Series appearance and six victories away from defending their championship after a 10-3 thrashing of the Texas Rangers in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, a win that squared the ALCS at two games apiece.
The heroes were many: Jose Altuve got his flowers, celebrated for playing in his 100th postseason game and characteristically banging out three hits. Alex Bregman got the party started, a two-run, first-inning triple igniting a team-wide strafing of the Rangers’ pitching staff.
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
And Jose Abreu, a first-year Astro, administered the kill shot, a three-run home run that put the Rangers to sleep.
It is Alvarez, though, who is bracketed by Bregman and Abreu in the lineup, who banged out two more hits, drove in three more runs and broke a tie by hitting a ball 411 feet for a sacrifice fly, a plate appearance that was the baseball equivalent of a crushing lead block that enabled Abreu to waltz into the end zone.
In eight postseason games, Alvarez is now batting .419 (13 for 31), reaching base at a .471 clip, and has driven in 13 runs. It won’t appear on his playoff game log, but let the record reflect that the hitters in front and behind him in the lineup combined to drive in five runs.
And after getting shut out 2-0 in Game 1 of this ALCS, the Astros have scored four, eight and 10 runs in their next three games. The swagger is back, largely because of their cleanup hitter who often moves in silence but might give Bryce Harper a run as the most impactful hitter in the game.
“Alvarez is on fire right now. And he’s the best hitter in the world,” says outfielder Chas McCormick, whose third career postseason home run gave Houston a 9-3 lead. “So when our guy’s going, and we get Altuve going and Jose Abreu going, we’re one of the best teams in the world.
“Having Alvarez hit like he’s been hitting, nothing can stop us right now.”
Thursday’s action offered plenty of evidence.
For both teams, Game 4 was the get-through game: No Justin Verlander, no Max Scherzer or Nathan Eovaldi or Framber Valdez on the hill. It figured that itinerant starters Andrew Heaney and Jose Urquidy would give way to a bullpen battle, and by the fourth inning, it was 3-3 and those fellows were footnotes.
Dane Dunning, Heaney’s capable piggyback partner, started the inning issuing two walks and a single, and after striking out Alex Bregman, was not going to face Alvarez with the bases loaded.
So Cody Bradford, a soft-throwing but deceptive rookie lefty, was summoned for the impossible task. Bradford was unscored upon in 4⅓ playoff innings this year. But Alvarez was a different ask.
They battled for nine pitches, Alvarez fouling off four pitches, fastballs at 91 and changeups far slower than that, before Bradford finally left one in the zone.
Alvarez clubbed it just to the right of dead center field, 111 mph off his bat and looking for all the world like it was his seventh homer in eight games this postseason. Bradford backpedaled and looked, hoping for the best. The ball went 401 feet and would have been a grand slam in 17 of 30 ballparks, according to Statcast.
In this one, it was a go-ahead sacrifice fly.
Yet for Rangers manager Bruce Bochy, Alvarez was the focal point of the sequence. The three-batter minimum ensured Bradford would have to face Abreu, too.
And if Alvarez was pounding away and softening up a piece of red meat, it was Abreu who got to eat.
He pummeled a Bradford fastball, a low screamer that eventually rose over the Astros bullpen and the first layer of seats, landing in the second level of Globe Life Field. It was 7-3 Houston.
“Yordan's hit two balls 111 to center field that haven't been homers. It’s crazy,” says Bregman, recalling a similar shot in Game 3 that center fielder Leody Taveras brought back over the fence to rob a home run. “I've never seen it before in my life. And for him to come through like that time and time again for us, it's huge.
“And then Abreu coming up with another big swing, it was massive for our team.”
You’d think Abreu had the best job in baseball, hitting behind Alvarez, but the year has at times been a struggle for the White Sox legend. He’s found a groove in October, hitting four home runs, three of them at least 430 feet.
Even if there’s not much on the table when he comes up.
“It’s been difficult at times, I’m not going to lie,” says Abreu through a team translator. “The most important things are the victories. If we keep getting the victories, I’ll continue hitting there.”
Um, why is it so difficult?
“He drives in all the runs.”
When told of his Cuban countryman’s gripe, Alvarez allowed a little grin.
“Like I always say, if they leave a pitch over the middle of the plate, and I’m able to make contact, I’m going to try to drive them in,” he says. “Both of us couldn’t have missed (Bradford). I couldn’t get it done.”
OK, so sometimes he’s pretty modest. But he does have his pride, and a good memory. When asked if this October was his most locked-in, he offered a mild rebuttal.
“I don’t know. I think 2021 was also pretty interesting,” he said, to the laughter of onlookers.
That’s fair. Alvarez posted a .315 average and 1.049 OPS and the Astros reached Game 6 of the World Series before falling to the Atlanta Braves. And 2022 wasn’t too bad.
Who could forget his two ninth-inning home runs to almost singlehandedly knock Seattle out of the AL Division Series? Or his gargantuan go-ahead home run off Jose Alvarado in the sixth inning of Game 6 of the World Series, a shot that made it rain champagne hours later?
But he batted .192 last postseason, drawing six walks to 16 strikeouts. Yet even at his less than best, he had a massive impact on Houston’s championship.
As for this year?
“He’s the best hitter in the game, hands down. He does that every day,” says center fielder Mauricio Dubon, who had five hits in nine at-bats in Games 3 and 4. “It’s a little bit more magnified because it’s the postseason. But he does that every day.
“He can beat you with a single to left field, or he can put it 460 feet dead center. Not many guys can do that. It’s crazy. The other team doesn’t want you to beat him.
“At the same time, it’s inevitable.”
It’s starting to feel that way, even if Alvarez, 26, strangely slips under the radar. The loudest boos during pregame introductions here are for Altuve and Bregman, members of the Astros teams who partook in the 2017-18 sign-stealing scheme.
Yet the Rangers were terrible those years. You’d think the guy squeezing the life out of their 90-win team, unsullied by scandal, might attract more enmity.
Oh, well. The Astros, now in their seventh consecutive ALCS, have responded as both internal and external observers believed – very much alive and likely now the favorites to win two of these final three games.
“When you give hope to the Houston Astros and some fuel, some adversity too, we take that really well,” says McCormick. “We had a huge amount of confidence coming here.”
It’s only growing. Four relievers covered the final 6⅔ innings, with high-leverage stars Hector Neris, Bryan Abreu and Ryan Pressly getting a needed night off. Justin Verlander will pitch Game 5. And the Astros have outscored the Rangers 57-18 the past five games at Globe Life.
They’ll also have the best player on the field, perhaps any field, batting cleanup.
“You can’t pitch around him because there’s danger in front of him,” says Game 4 winning pitcher Ryne Stanek, “and danger behind him. You’ve got to pitch to everybody.”
No, Alvarez is not a one-man team. Just one man who influences outcomes like few before him.
NEW YORK – The Rolling Stones will not go quietly.
Nearly 60 years since dropping their blues-steeped debut, the legendary rock band rooted by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards continues to make a glorious noise, continues to pique our attention with every utterance of a new tour and, simply, continues to matter.
The band’s latest album, “Hackney Diamonds,” their first new material since 2005’s “A Bigger Bang,” arrived Friday.
But a few hours before the clock struck midnight, the Rolling Stones roared through a seven-song set that blurred the lines between vintage and fresh – the the dozen tracks on “Hackney” really are that robust – at an invite-only club show at Racket NYC.
“Yes, yes, yes,” Jagger uttered as he roamed the corners of the small stage to greet the crowd of about 650 before offering a sly smile. “We’re gonna play some old, and we’re gonna play some new.”

What Jagger didn’t mention was the band was going to welcome a surprise guest to close their set – and really, how could there not be something special at a show this intimate? – in the form of an absolutely kinetic Lady Gaga, who performs on “Hackney.”
The groove-infested “Shattered,” their 1978 seedy ode to New York, proved the ideal opener for the night. Jagger, his vocal delivery as elastic as his facial expressions, slithered between Ronnie Wood and Richards, his feet following his hips, as he spat the lyrics “pride and joy and greed and sex, that's what makes our town the best” and the famous aside, “shadoobie.”
But first Jagger, Richards, Wood, longtime bassist Darryl Jones, drummer Steve Jordan (who took the seat of the late Charlie Watts in 2021), keyboardist Matt Clifford and singer Chanel Haynes had a few other tunes to unleash.
Seesawing between classic and new, the band stomped through the staccato rocker “Angry,” the Stones-iest Stones song in decades. Richards, all scarves and bandannas, ripped out the instant classic riff, filling in the notes between Jones’ rumbling bass lines.
Everyone on stage appeared to be steeped in joy. Wood, who has endured a few recent bouts of cancer, grinned as he stepped up to solo during “Whole Wide World,” while Jones thundered behind his kit, already a master at Watts’ signature playing style of never hitting the high hat and snare drum simultaneously. (Watts played on two songs on “Hackney Diamonds” – “Live By the Sword” and “Mess It Up.")
Jagger, as if it needs to be said, remains an indefatigable wonder at 80, his moves a blend of peacock strutting and karate chopping, his voice as distinctive and grainy as ever.
While the turbo-charged newcomer “Bite My Head Off” (featuring Paul McCartney playing bass on the album) already sounds primed for the stadiums the Stones still rule, it was the memory-ingrained guitar chords of “Tumbling Dice” and “Jumpin’ Jack Flash” that galvanized a crowd speckled with celebrities including Chris Rock, Daniel Craig, Trevor Noah, Elvis Costello, Diana Krall, Jimmy Fallon and Christie Brinkley.
The band, however, saved its showstopper for the inevitable encore. “Sweet Sounds Of Heaven,” a muscular gospel-blues standout on the new album, was already landing with visceral intensity thanks to Jagger singing like a preacher, drawing the crowd in with his gestures and falling to his knees.
But then Lady Gaga strutted out with her blond hair in a Debbie Harry-esque rocker ruffle, sparkly jumpsuit cut low in the front and divided vertically between pink and black.
She immediately confirmed she is a worthy sparring partner for Jagger as the pair circled one another, each approaching the other as prey. Their intensity was palpable as they traded soulful wails, simultaneously bounced – she in platform heels – and fed off the force of the music. After Lady Gaga tossed down the mic stand in a frenzied moment of singing, Jagger ceded the spotlight to her to close out the song with iron-lunged ferocity.
The two pros were left breathless from being completely possessed by the song, and as Jagger led her to the front of the stage to take a bow with the band, it solidified that not only do the Rolling Stones still matter, but their legacy continues to inspire.

PHOENIX — OK so it didn’t quite have the drama of Luis Gonzalez’s walk-off hit in 2001. 
This was a Game 3 in the National League Championship Series, not a World Series Game 7. 
This didn’t produce a title for the Arizona Diamondbacks over the powerful New York Yankees that made Gonzalez a hero in Arizona. 
But, on a record-setting hot day in Arizona with temperatures hitting 103, the name of Ketel Marte will forever resonate in D-backs history. 
It was Marte’s walk-off single with one out in the ninth inning that not only saved the Diamondbacks’ season with a 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Championship Series, but also prevented manager Torey Lovullo from being vilified all winter. 
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
Brandon Pfaadt, the D-backs’ 25-year-old rookie, was pitching the greatest game of his career Thursday when he looked towards the dugout in the sixth inning and saw Lovullo walking to the mound. He couldn’t believe it. Neither could the crowd of 47,075 at Chase Field. Or even Pfaadt’s teammates. 
“He looked good, man, he was great," D-backs right fielder Tommy Pham said. “If anything, I would have left him in. You don’t want to take out a guy like that with so much momentum on our side. Let him keep going."
Pfaadt had given up just two hits, striking out nine, and had thrown just 70 pitches in 5 ⅔ shutout innings. He joined Don Newcombe of the 1949 Brooklyn Dodgers as the only rookies to strike out at least nine batters without a walk in postseason history. 
Still, Lovullo walked to the mound, and was serenaded by loud boos, with fans showing their disgust at the decision, saying, according to Lovullo, “Has the manager lost his absolute mind?’ 
“I'm sure I was the most unpopular guy in the city of Phoenix, in the downtown area, and maybe in the entire state of Arizona, right? I was booing myself as I walked out to the mound," Lovullo said. “I didn’t need to be in the stands. … 
“I want everybody to know, that is trying to think along with me, that we have a strategy. I have a strategy for everything that's done. Everything that's done has been well talked about. It's not just analytics. I know how quickly playoff baseball can change. 
“So, yes, I am prepared to get booed. I am prepared to get second-guessed. It's my job."
The decision to remove him was mostly scripted, with Lovullo saying before the game that he was counting on Pfaadt to face about 18 batters, which was exactly number Pfaadt saw. Yet, Lovullo brushed back at the notion it was simply a matter of analytics, and that a decision was made without discussing it with pitching coach Brent Strom and his staff. 
“So, the conversations are very typical," Lovullo said. “I’m asking them if the manager is an idiot after taking his out after five and two-thirds [innings]. I know it's a very unpopular decision, but we have great information.’’ 
Pfaadt wasn’t too keen with the decision either, but hey, he’s a rookie. What’s he going to say? Besides, it all worked out in the end. 
“Obviously I'm a competitor," Pfaadt said. “I want to keep going. Everybody does, but at the end of the day, you just have to trust his decision and move forward, go to the bullpen, let them do their jobs." 
Despite a few shaky moments by the bullpen after Pfaadt’s departure, coughing up a run in the seventh inning on reliever Ryan Thompson’s wild pitch, the D-backs quickly recovered to score the game-tying run in the seventh.
It set up the ninth inning with the Diamondbacks capitalizing on veteran closer Craig Kimbrel’s wildness, retiring just one of the four batters he faced, culminating on Marte’s sharp single to center field, setting off a wild celebration. 
And, yes, a whole lot of relief, with the D-backs winning their first NLCS game since beating Atlanta in 2001. 
“It feels great," Marte said. “In my opinion, that’s what we needed right? The support, a little bump, or a little push so we can kind of turn it back against them. ... I’m excited to be fighting."
Really, Marte was destined to be the Diamondbacks’ hero. 
He’s the only guy hitting for Arizona. Marte is 6-for-13 (.462) in the series while his teammates are hitting just .179. 
“He has an unbelievable heartbeat," Lovullo said. “He loves to be in that moment. He is one of our best players for a reason. … 
“Ketel thrives in that situation. He just has the heart of a lion. He wants to get the job done and be the main guy to help his team win a baseball game."
If it wasn’t for Tommy Pham, who was busy putting together motorized rally cars in the clubhouse afterwards, Marte may never have gotten the chance to be a hero. 
Pham, who was in a zero-for-12 slide and struck out in his first two at-bats Thursday, was told that he was going to be taken out of the game for a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning. Yet, he was on the on-deck circle when the inning ended. 
Lovullo stuck with Pham to open the seventh inning, and he delivered a sharp leadoff single to center field off reliever Orion Kerkering. Speedy Alek Thomas was brought in to pinch-run for Pham, and he scored easily on Lourdes Gurriel’s sharp double into the left-field corner, tying game at 1-apiece. 
“They wanted to take me out," Pham said, “but I’ve got to prove them wrong, I guess.’’ 
The Diamondbacks still trail in the NLCS, 2 games to 1, but now have life, knowing that their victory guarantees ace, Zac Gallen, will pitch Game 5 at Chase Field after going with a bullpen-by-committee Friday.
GAME 3 RECAP:Diamondbacks beat Phillies on Ketel Marte's walk-off
“Zac pitching at home, hey, that sounds pretty good," Pham. “I’ll take that any day."
The D-backs still believe, and if nothing else, maybe they created a little doubt that the Phillies won’t steamroll them on their way to a return trip to the World Series. 
“We have a lot of talent on this club," Marte said. “We just have to believe it. And I think we do. We can compete with anybody in this league. 
“You’re seeing that."

After about a dozen years at the helm, Costco's Craig Jelinek is stepping down from his role as chief executive.
The transition is set to take place on Jan. 1, with President and Chief Operating Officer Ron Vachris taking over as CEO. Jelinek will remain at Costco through April 2024 in an advisory role and will stand for reelection on the board in January, according to a statement from the company. 
Jelinek became CEO in January 2012 and has continued his predecessor's focus on keeping prices low and employees happy within the country’s third-largest retailer.  
But not everything has remained the same. Here are some of the changes ushered in during Jelinek’s time as CEO.
When Jelinek’s succession was announced, Costco had 592 warehouses in operation, 429 of which were in the United States. The company’s footprint has gone up 45% since then, with 861 warehouses – including 591 in the U.S. – operating today.  
Jelinek has also helped increase Costco's international presence, opening warehouses in China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand and Sweden.  
The company's share price has surged under Jelinek, from about $80 per share in early 2012 to over $550 today. Its share price has gone up over 25% so far this year, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500.
And revenue has more than doubled, from $99 billion in 2012 to $242.3 billion in the latest fiscal year.  
Jelinek told Bloomberg Businessweek in 2013 that the company would be eliminating self-checkout in stores after experimenting with the technology, noting that he thought employees did the job better. 
“They are great for low-volume warehouses, but we don’t want to be in the low-volume warehouse business,” he said at the time. 
Costco reversed its decision in 2019 and is now cracking down on checking membership cards at self-checkout lanes to prevent unauthorized card-sharing.  
Costco in 2019 opened a $450 million poultry complex in Fremont, Nebraska to help keep its rotisserie chicken prices at $4.99.
In a 2019 earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said the plant can process about 2 million birds a week. The plant was estimated to save Costco about 35 cents per bird in 2015, or about $35 million annually.
Costco membership fees went up from $55 to $60 in 2017 under Jelinek, the first price hike since a $5 increase in 2011. 
Membership prices are expected to jump again soon, with Galanti noting in an earnings call that “it’s a question of when, not if.” He noted that membership hikes typically take place every five to six years.  
How much is Costco's annual fee?Costco membership price increase 'a question of when, not if,' CFO says
Certain food court items, including the chicken bake and soda, have seen price hikes in recent months, according to Insider.
But there is one item on the menu with a price that has remained unchanged since 1985: the Costco hotdog.  
During an earnings call last year, Galanti said other parts of the business should help the company keep its hotdog prices stable “forever.” And when Jelinek was asked on CNBC last year if he would raise the food court item’s price from $1.50, he had a simple answer: “No.”
CONCORD, N.H.−It’s a “really bad day” for former President Donald Trump, according to GOP presidential hopeful Chris Christie.  
That’s because Sidney Powell, Trump’s former attorney, pled guilty Thursday to six misdemeanor charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia.
Under the terms of the agreement, Powell will serve a six-year probation, pay a fine of $6,000 and testify at the trials of several co-defendants in the case. She also agreed to write an apology letter to Georgia residents.  
“The interesting part of that plea is that she will be testifying against Mark Meadows, against Rudy Giuliani, against Donald Trump,” Christie told reporters shortly after filling to put his name on the ballot in New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary. “You don't give a no-jail plea deal unless that person's got something very good to say that will help your case against the others.” 
Powell was among 19 defendants named in Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis’ Georgia election interference case, which also included Trump.  
“I did this for seven years in the fifth largest office in the country," said Christie, who served as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey from January 2002 to December 2008. "You don't give a no-jail plea deal unless that person's got something very good to say that will help your case against the others."
More school buses across the country could be fitted with Wi-Fi after a vote Thursday by the Federal Communications Commission.
In a 3-2 vote along party lines, commissioners adopted a declaratory ruling allowing districts to use money from the E-Rate program, which helps schools and libraries buy affordable broadband, toward Wi-Fi and supported devices on buses. 
Democrats on the commission and in Congress lauded the proposal as a way of supporting students, particularly those in rural areas, with lengthy commutes to and from school. Greater access to Wi-Fi, they said, would help close disparities in homework completion and academic success.
Republicans, however, cautioned against what they saw as potentially wasteful government spending that they claimed could increase students’ access to unsupervised internet use. 
Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said the proposal was an effort to make sure the E-Rate program, which is paid for by a system of subsidies and fees from telecommunications companies, keeps up with the times, as children have become increasingly reliant on technology to complete their schoolwork. 
“Call it Wi-Fi on wheels,” she said. 
Digital divide:Rise of online learning gives students with broadband access at home a leg up.
Rosenworcel said during Thursday’s hearing that she was particularly struck by a story she heard while on a trip to a Vermont school district last week: A school librarian spoke about a young girl who had no broadband access at home. 
“At the end of every school day, she rushed to the library just before the bus left, and furiously printed out her assignments,” Rosenworcel said. “Let’s be clear, this a kid with extraordinary grit. But it shouldn’t be this hard.” 
Matt Fedders, the superintendent of the Vermont school district that Rosenworcel visited, told USA TODAY some of his rural students face daily commutes bordering on an hour. He’s hoping the language change approved at Thursday’s hearing will allow him to cover some of the ongoing costs associated with a bus Wi-Fi program his district already has underway. 
“We have a lot of students who do not have any reliable internet in their homes,” he said. 
The measure was supported by AASA, The School Superintendents Association and several national rural education associations.

Congressional Republicans opposed the proposal in recent weeks. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state in a letter last month raised concerns about "subsidizing unsupervised internet access to social media sites like TikTok."
“Addictive and distracting social media apps are inviting every evil force on the planet into kids’ classrooms, homes, and minds by giving those who want to abuse or harm children direct access to communicate with them online," Cruz said in a statement. 
Fedders, the Vermont superintendent, said the devices on buses in his district have all the same firewalls and security measures as the network in the school building. 
“We are able to limit the access to content that we do not want them using,” he said. 
Keith Krueger, CEO of the education technology group the Consortium for School Networking, said a recent survey from his organization showed only 13% of districts say they provide Wi-Fi on school buses.
“From our perspective and the vast majority of educators, they see great value in recapturing time that students are commuting to school,” he told USA TODAY.

Back in the good old days, when Jim Harbaugh was provoking someone in college football on a near-daily basis, nothing could get him rolling on social media faster than an allegation of cheating. 
“If the Georgia coach is implying any intent on our part to break rules, he is barking up the wrong tree,” Harbaugh tweeted on Feb. 24, 2016, after Kirby Smart suggested the NCAA would be forced to step in after Michigan held spring practice at IMG Academy. 
The following year, when ESPN’s Paul Finebaum suggested that Michigan hiring the father of a top recruit to his coaching staff was unsavory (albeit allowed), Harbaugh fired back with a Tweet calling him “Pete Finebaum, the unabashed SEC water carrier.” 
But when you play in the gray area of the NCAA rulebook while walking around like you’ve just been blessed by the Pope, you tend to make a lot of enemies. 
And now that Michigan is residing near the top of college football again, all the fangs are coming out. 
For the second time this year, Harbaugh is in the middle of a snit with the NCAA over potential rules violations that were petty, completely avoidable and ultimately quite stupid if they indeed took place. 
Harbaugh served a self-imposed three-game suspension at the beginning of this season for misleading or not cooperating with NCAA investigators during an investigation into impermissible contact with recruits and coaching activities during the COVID-19 dead period. 
Now, in a story reported first Thursday by Yahoo! Sports and confirmed by the Big Ten, Michigan is under another inquiry for in-person scouting of opponents, which has been against the rules for nearly 30 years and is quite unnecessary these days, unless the goal is to glean extra information about an opponent's play-calls that teams often try to disguise on the sideline.
Now I know what you, the well-informed college sports fan, is thinking. If the NCAA couldn’t pin anything on Kansas basketball coach Bill Self just last week for having Adidas help him recruit players despite years of investigative work and loads of evidence pointing toward a significant punishment, how in the world is Harbaugh going to get popped for relatively petty crimes?
The answer is because NCAA enforcement is a lot like traffic cops. They’re not going to catch everybody. They may pick one speeding car to turn the siren on for over another for biased reasons. But when they have you on the radar gun going 90 miles per hour on the highway, they’re going to write you a ticket — especially if you act difficult and indignant when they pull you over. 
If all of this stuff is proven true, Harbaugh made it easy on them. And given his proclivity toward Michigan Man self-righteousness, the rest of college football is snickering away. 
Selective enforcement? Maybe. 
But the rules Michigan allegedly violated are so clear and straightforward — and ultimately offer so little upside — that all suspicions about the way Harbaugh conducts his program are now completely fair game. 
Back in 2020, when the world was figuring out COVID-19 one day at a time, NCAA schools agreed that it was better for everyone to just take a pause on recruiting and other normal offseason activities.
Is it a huge deal if Harbaugh went to a restaurant with a couple of recruits who were in town during that time? Not really, but it is a willful violation in order to gain a competitive advantage. And then to not be truthful or forthcoming about it with the NCAA? That’s another bright red line that the NCAA has used many times to penalize coaches, because catching them in a lie is one of the few hammers they actually have.
This alleged scouting violation is even sillier. Michigan is 7-0 and has won its games by 27, 28, 25, 24, 38, 42 and 45 points. 
If, as The Athletic reported Thursday, the Big Ten has evidence of a “vast network” being used to steal signs, it's the most comical use of espionage since Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase paired up in “Spies Like Us.”
If you need to steal signs to beat Nebraska and Rutgers, you’re more con man than Michigan Man.
Much of the focus now will turn to whether these dual investigations end up chasing Harbaugh back to the NFL, especially if the Wolverines -- who might really be the best team in the country -- end up winning a national title. 
It’s an interesting topic, but honestly, trying to predict Harbaugh’s mindset or his next move is a lost cause. Before this story dropped, there was talk of another extension in the works. But Harbaugh has said before he’s staying at Michigan one week, interviewed with an NFL team the next and then come back to say it was a one-time thing (at least until the next one-time thing). 
When you're that slippery, aloofness is a helpful trait -- and Harbaugh uses it to his advantage time and time again. 
But the more interesting part of the story is really how this comeuppance has been kind of in the works ever since Harbaugh got back into college football. 
You can stand up and say you do things by the book and take great offense to accusations that you’re shading the rules, but make no mistake: Harbaugh at Michigan has absolutely made a home in the gray area while tacitly accusing everyone else in the sport of being cheaters. 
In 2019, author John Bacon — someone who is closely tied to the Michigan program and wrote a book on Harbaugh — claimed that Rashan Gary was offered $300,000 by another school during his recruitment before choosing the Wolverines (this is before name, image and likeness would have allowed for similar arrangements).
Most people in college sports would look at that claim skeptically — not about the offer itself but the idea that somebody would choose to play for a school offering nothing but the standard scholarship when they could have pocketed $300,000 somewhere else, even if it was against the rules. 
Why even put that out there other than to glorify Mr. “Do it the right way” while casting aspersions on competitors? It’s not just unseemly, it’s phony. Because another huge part of the story in the Gary recruitment was that Harbaugh in 2015 hired Chris Partridge as director of player personnel and recruiting. Who is Chris Partridge? Well, he was the head coach at Paramus Catholic High School in New Jersey, where Gary played until enrolling at Michigan in 2016. 
Again, just like the example that got Harbaugh crossways with Finebaum, it’s not against the rules. Partridge was qualified for the job and is now in his second stint on the Michigan staff after working as the co-defensive coordinator and safeties coach the last three seasons. 
But hiring the high school coach of the No. 1 prospect in the country and then landing that prospect from several states away is a gray-area move. Just like Harbaugh holding so-called “satellite camps” for recruits in Southern states, sleeping over at a recruit’s house or even this summer, when former tight end Jake Butt told a story via X (formerly Twitter) about how Harbaugh exploited a loophole in the practice time limits to get more reps in the spring.
“Harbaugh is great at taking advantage of Grey areas,” Butt wrote.
How long of a leap is it from the gray to outright rule-breaking — even if the rules are picayune? Maybe not that long.
But it's worth harkening back to the prescient words of Kirby Smart from seven years ago, when his little spat with Harbaugh got started over the IMG trip. 
“They're obviously trying to gain a competitive advantage, and that’s their right,” he said. "But I think the NCAA in due time will have to step in. I don’t know how it’s going to go down. It’s going to be interesting too see, though.” 
It sure is. 
Lupita Nyong'o is opening up about being in "a season of heartbreak" amid a fresh breakup.
Though the "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" actor knows "there are much more important things going on in the world right now," she felt compelled to share a "a personal truth and publicly dissociate myself from someone I can no longer trust," according to her Instagram post Thursday.
While she didn't explicitly name who she was referring to, Nyong'o has been romantically linked with television host Selema Masekela. The two seemingly confirmed their relationship and went Instagram official in December, though according to People, it's unclear when the two began dating.
Her heartbreak, she added, is due to "a love suddenly and devastatingly extinguished by deception."
Her announcement comes a day after she was seen attending a Janelle Monáe concert with actor Joshua Jackson amid his divorce from Jodie Turner-Smith. The Daily Mail published photos of the two at the Los Angeles concert on Oct. 18.
On Instagram, Nyong'o continued: "But I am reminded that the magnitude of the pain I am feeling is equal to the measure of my capacity for love. And so, I am choosing to face the pain, cultivating the courage to meet my life exactly as it is, and trusting that this too shall pass. The promise, they say, is that a tender heart is what gives birth to fearlessness."
Nyong'o hopes that opening up about how she's dealing with a breakup "might be useful to someone else out there experiencing the grip of heartbreak who is poised to try and escape from the pain and miss out on the wisdom that comes from it," she wrote, adding "#Breakup."
"Let’s face our pain so we don’t spread it," she concluded her message.
Several friends chimed in with to share their love and supportive comments under Nyong'o's post.
Gabrielle Union-Wade kept it simple with two black hearts and the prayer hands emoji, while Marlon Wayans reminded Nyong'o to "Trust God. He wants better for you."
"All lessons are blessings especially the painful ones. This too shall pass. Warmest of hugs. Be kind to you as you heal," the comedian and writer wrote. "I always say whenever (I) have a break up 'lucky me, i get to love ME again. I missed you me.' Go love on you woman."
Josh Gad expressed his love, and Ava DuVernay said, "We lift you up with love and sisterhood. Your miracles are all around you. Let us count them in confidence and in faith."
"Black Panther's" Oscar-winning costume designer, Ruth E. Carter, told Nyong'o to "lean on your supportive friends," adding, "I’m am here to soothe your heart."

According to People, Nyong'o wished Masekela a happy birthday in August. As of Thursday, the post is no longer visible on her Instagram feed.
"And THEN... the Universe saw it fit to bring this Sunshine Human ☀️ into my orbit, and this day marks his introduction to life," she wrote on social media at the time, per the outlet. "Every day is full of #goodenergy and reasons to dance with @selema as my favorite playmate. Happy Birthday, mi amor!"
Masekela responded to her post, writing: "sneaky, mi amor. luckiest man alive. my heart is smiling wide."
Masekela has yet to speak out about the split.
After 31 long years of waiting, a woman from New York has stepped forward to share with local lottery officials she was the person who never claimed $12 million from a 1991 Lotto jackpot.
Janet Valenti, age 77, revealed that she was the rightful owner of a $12 million New York Lotto jackpot that sat unclaimed for over 30 years.
One small mistake led to the unfortunate fate of the ticket, and there was nothing she could do to retrieve it.
Valenti claimed she had the winning lottery ticket worth $12 million sitting on an end table next to her couch, among other lottery tickets, according to the Lottery Post. She believed she had previously checked all the tickets on the table, so as she was preparing to leave her home with her two teenage children and mother to spend the weekend at a friend's house, she threw the tickets in the trash. That was back in July of 1991.
Over the weekend, she was unaware of her huge mistake. When she returned, a friend informed her of a winning $12 million Lotto ticket sold in Staten Island. Valenti discovered she had won after seeing the winning numbers in the paper.
Upon arriving home, she rushed to retrieve her ticket from the garbage, but could not find it.
"My next-door neighbor, who has never in her life, the whole time I lived there, ever put my garbage out for collection, she did," Valenti told the Lottery.
She couldn't go digging in the trash due to sanitation already picking up the garbage. It was over, Valenti was out that $12 million.
The woman from Staten Island attempted to contact lawyers but was informed that the only way to claim the prize was with a physical lottery ticket. Even obtaining surveillance footage from the retailer would be of no use.
"I was a wreck," Valenti recalled to the Lottery. "I was sick for a long time over it."
On July 17, 1992, the $12 million Lotto jackpot went unclaimed and was returned to the state lottery fund. This unclaimed prize holds the record for being the largest in New York's history.
Valenti was a single mother to her two teenage children, Kevin and Jennifer, at the time. Her husband, Bruno, had passed away in 1984. To cope with the incident, she turned to reading stories about "lottery curses", infamous stories of people whose lives took a turn for the worse after winning the Lottery. This helped her from losing her mind over the situation.
"Given that kind of money, things can go bad," Valenti told the Lottery. "That was a saving grace. Who knows what would have happened if I'd had that money? You read these stories, a lot of people win Lotto, they drop dead. Maybe it was [Bruno] looking out for us to not have that kind of money."
Despite her tremendous loss over 30 years ago, Valenti remains steadfast in her pursuit of playing the Lottery.
"The most I ever get is a free play or a couple of dollars," she said. "That's it."

Someone won $12 million in Lotto on July 17, 1991, with a ticket purchased for $1 at J.N.J. Delicatessen in Graniteville. Despite holding the winning numbers (2, 3, 6, 43, and 51) the winner never claimed the prize. Carolina Cutroneo, the store owner, asked customers if they had the ticket for a year following the win.
"I think somebody, when they saw they'd won, died or never found out in the first place," she had said at the time. "In the beginning, we were putting up signs every day, but no one came forward. It's probably somebody who really needs it."
According to New York Lottery spokesperson Bill Knowlton, the big prize winner could have been a visitor to the state or someone unfamiliar with playing the Lottery in New York. Knowlton also explained that some winners may wait to claim their prize because they are in the process of assembling an advisory team or they forget to do so.
According to Knowlton, one lottery winner waited three months to claim her prize because she was studying for her finals.

A trendy Barcelona bar decorated in pastel pink and green hues has been named the world’s best bar of 2023. 
Sips, located in the heart of Barcelona’s L'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample district has not only earned the title of best in the world, but also best in Europe, according to this year’s The World’s 50 Best Bars list, an annual ranking of bars determined by the votes of 680 drinks experts from across the globe.
Don’t be fooled by the cozy interior, Sips can turn into a “a dark and sultry hideaway” as soon as the sun begins to set. Esencia, a bar inside the bar offers customers a wine tasting experience of sorts that breaks down the signature cocktails they offer in sips. 
There is the off chance that any one of their “wondrous creations” may be served in a metal cast of two hands, or a glass, depending on how colorful the cocktail, of course. 
This is the second year in a row that a Barcelona bar has taken possession of the top spot. 
"When we started Sips, we strongly believed that the bar was a beacon name itself. The drinks, music and the architecture of the bar itself are like 'little drops that fill the glass,' creating an experience that is unique to Sips,” Marc Álvarez, co-founder of Sips shared with CNBC.
Honorees from 28 different cities around the world were recognized at a live awards ceremony in Singapore on Tuesday, marking the first time the ceremony has been held in Asia. 
Double Chicken Please in New York City was named second best for the first time, while Handshake Speakeasy in Mexico City took third place. 
The U.S. tied with England for most bars on the list, with a total of five U.S.-based bars included. Three of the bars named are in New York City. Café La Trova in Miami came in 24th place, while New Orleans bar Jewel of the South ranked 49 out of 50. 
Mexico City follows the U.S. and London closely, with four bars making the list. Argentina and Singapore were the countries with the third most number of winning bars with three wins each. 
Other special awards include the Roku Industry Icon awarded to Renato "Tato" Giovannoni of Florería Atlántico in Buenos Aires and The Ketel One Sustainable Bar Award bestowed upon Röda Huset in Stockholm, among many other awards presented that night.

The footage from the ceremony quieted from routine clapping for the graduates crossing the stage at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans as the university president and everyone else in the auditorium spotted Aiyana Jones arriving in a wheelchair.
The crowd at the historically Black Catholic university's Convocation Center rose to its feet for the 22-year-old graduating with a biology degree and a Spanish minor.
A tropical disease once seen almost exclusively among Americans returning from travel abroad now has a unique U.S. strain.
Health officials warn that a related, deadlier parasite seen in other countries could thrive in the U.S. due to these improved climatological conditions for the disease.
The parasite known as leishmania spreads when sandflies, historically found in tropical climes, bite people. Sandflies carrying the parasite also infect other mammals such as woodrats which further allow its movement. Climate change, some researchers say, may be expanding the geographical reach of sandflies and, consequently, the reach of the disease.
A related parasite also comes in undetected by way of one million dogs entering the country annually. The U.S. doesn't have adequate screening in place for the parasite, which is something researchers hope to address.
Previous infections came to the U.S. when people traveling from warmer areas brought the disease back. The U.S. doesn’t have federal reporting on the disease, making it difficult to understand its sudden prevalence in recent years. But new findings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate cases of the milder form of the disease, cutaneous leishmaniasis, derived from a slightly different American parasitic strain.
Public health:Illinois reports first case of measles in the state in 4 years, health officials say
“This is a disease that we in the United States don’t really think about,” said Dr. Mary Kamb, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria. “It’s really a disease that belongs to other countries.”
The World Health Organization estimates as many as one million people get cutaneous leishmaniasis annually. The populations infected are mostly in areas with warmer climates such as the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Latin America. However, health officials suspect warmer southern American states, including Texas, have more suitable conditions for sandflies to thrive and pass on the disease. 
The disease can disfigure people’s skin with ulcers that sometimes take weeks or months to show after a person has been bitten. It can leave scarring that researchers say is recognizable and brings a social stigma in low-income countries. Cutaneous leishmaniasis doesn’t cause death or severe disability, they said.
Medical mystery:How is leprosy spreading domestically in the US? Some experts point to armadillos.
On Thursday, Kamb and other CDC researchers presented an analysis at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene’s annual conference in Chicago looking at cases sent to CDC laboratories for testing from 2005 to 2019. The CDC findings are based on more than 2,000 cases across the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Eighty-six of the people involved in the research had not traveled abroad prior to developing leishmaniasis.
While cases found in the U.S. typically have genetic strains from abroad, the CDC researchers’ analysis indicates that a parasitic strain circulating in the U.S. for years is slightly different from the parasitic strain of leishmania mexicana that’s typically found in Mexico and Central America. 
The findings suggest the local strain has circulated for some time, and study authors recommend the U.S. develop better screening of the disease, Kamb said.
Other research, in addition to the study presented this week, has previously found leishmaniasis occurring within the U.S. 
While training in Texas, Dr. Bridget McIlwee, a dermatologist now based in Springfield, Illinois, worked with a patient with no history of international travel who contracted leishmaniasis. The man had small bumps on his ears. The marks didn’t resemble textbook images of cases, McIlwee noted, so she said it could have been confused for another benign health condition. After performing a biopsy on the bumps, tissue samples matched leishmaniasis.
In a 2018 study, McIlwee examined additional cases, mostly reported to the Texas Department of State Health Services, which includes leishmaniasis as a reportable condition, from 2007 to 2017. About 59% of the cases involved patients who had not traveled abroad for 10 years. 
Even for cases that doctors diagnosed leishmaniasis, few were actually reported to public health officials, McIlwee added.
“If it's not required to be reported, then we can't really track it nationally,” McIlwee said. “That is another interesting piece of the puzzle because it's going to be hard for us to keep an eye on it without a mechanism for national reporting.”
As conditions warm due to climate change, habitats for sandflies are projected to expand northward, increasing vectors and reservoirs for leishmaniasis, said McIlwee, who has upcoming research on projections about the spread of the parasite.
The increased evidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis among American sandfly populations also increases the risk of a more severe form of the tropical disease surfacing in the U.S.
The focus of this week's presentation introduces another element for transmission: Dogs.
Known as visceral leishmaniasis, the deadlier disease researchers studied sometimes circulates among local insect populations after spreading from imported dogs carrying the pathogen into communities, according to researchers from the University of Iowa, U.S. Army Veterinary Services, Johns Hopkins University and the CDC who planned to present on the risks on Thursday. This strain is transmitted the same way as the skin-related disease, via sandfly bites, but visceral leishmaniasis contains a related parasite, leishmania infantum, that affects organs and kills upwards of 20,000 people annually in regions where the parasite thrives.
There isn’t a human vaccine for leishmaniasis, but vaccines are available for dogs in Europe and Brazil. Researchers on Thursday planned to show a new tool to promote screenings at ports of entry.
With both mild and severe forms of leishmaniasis, the U.S. needs to work with other countries to fight infectious diseases, according to Dr. Daniel Bausch, the president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
“A global approach is especially important," he said in a statement, "since climate change allows insects that carry pathogens like Leishmania, dengue virus and malaria to expand their range.”

Out of all the personality conflicts in the reality TV world, why did God, ABC and/or Gerry Turner end the burgeoning "Golden Bachelor" battle between Kathy and Theresa so quickly?
It was only last week that Kathy plunged the previously collegial mansion into the delicious heart of darkness by mobilizing against Theresa, who played the perfect victim while intensifying Kathy's rage by raving constantly about her deep "connection" with Gerry.
Yet before you could say "Real Housewives of New Jersey," the brewing brouhaha ended abruptly in Thursday's Episode 4.
Savor these fleeting moments in a power episode that featured a pickleball battle for Gerry's affections, a bawdy Never Have I Ever game with ice cream punishment, three women leaving the mansion (one of her own volition) and — saving the best for last — a shirtless Gerry, 72, presenting a rose during a steamy hot tub canoodle. Here's what happened in "The Golden Bachelor" Episode 4:
'The Golden Bachelor' Episode 3 recapThe fight for Gerry Turner's roses is on. Who lost?
This was the cruelest month for therapist April, 65, who had no business going home this early. April audaciously faked a wipeout and ankle injury before Gerry's pickleball tournament, then shooed concerned fellow contestants away so she could lean into Gerry's awkwardly protective embrace.
"The good 'ol mare ain't what she used to be," April said winsomely to Gerry. In the next solo scene, she literally winked to the camera with a sly smile and sotto voce remark, "Actually, I am totally fine." Classic.
April won the women-only Never Have I Ever game with nonstop confessions that included detailed experiences with car sex: "Front seat, back seat, on the steering wheel," she shrugged between bites of ice cream penance.
Inexplicably, Gerry didn't give April a rose.
All about the pickleball game'Golden Bachelor' Gerry Turner courts skills
Retired executive assistant Sandra, 75, is still alive in every way, even if she was last seen on bed rest from the hearty partaking of ice cream during the Never Have I Ever game. (Turns out she's lactose intolerant.) But she pushed through the dairy-filled gauntlet because she's a gamer.
Case in point, Sandra missed her daughter's wedding to impress Gerry in the pickleball tournament. She was a smashing first-timer, with a Jeter-esque lunge shot that should make ESPN highlights and play that propelled her team to runner-up status. (Kathy and hardcore pickleball enthusiast Ellen took the crown).
Gerry insisted Sandra make a joint FaceTime call to her just-wedded daughter. Their FaceTime moment was beautiful, complete with relatable iPhone tech fumbling. "We're too old for this," Sandra said with a smile. Sweet.
Gerry rewarded Sandra, who was too ill for the ceremony, with an early rose.
Fitness instructor Leslie, 64, the self-professed muse to Prince's song "Sexy Dancer," was excused from pickle play after drawing the one-on-one Gerry date. During their golden-light ATV jaunt, Gerry showed four-wheeler chivalry, riding behind Leslie to look after her.
But it wouldn't be a "Bachelor" season without a hot tub kiss. Gerry did not disappoint, after the two gazed into each other's mutually beautiful blue eyes.
Without dousing his rose, the suddenly shirtless Gerry helped Leslie into the tub, which materialized in a picturesque field with Champagne. Their post-rose clinch was PG-13 steamy, even with Gerry's right hand oddly stuck on the jacuzzi wall as if he was seeking the air-jets switch.
Retired educational consultant Kathy, 70, snapped right back into outrage mode after financial professional Theresa, 70, boasted of her first-date details (again) to the group and visiting former "Bachelorette" Trista Sutter. "She could just be the one for Gerry," Kathy said to the camera in an astute moment. "She just can't seem to find the 'off' button."
Theresa tried to patch things up with another apologetic heart-to-heart that ended with Kathy giving her "friendly advice" that would have spooked Tony Soprano.
"Zip it," said Kathy.
This became "Snip it" when Theresa tearfully recounted the exchange to Gerry. But it worked. Gerry was outraged, confronting Kathy with, "I'm beginning to sense a rift here that I'm not happy about!"
"I'm not the villain here," Kathy insisted. But even she could see the game was up. "Because of Theresa, I'm not getting a rose," she groused.
She was right about the rose. Not often portrayed as a healthy model for personal expression, Kathy made a graceful exit, giving a final wave to the group that included Theresa. She drove off in the black SUV with a brittle look of defiance.
"I am who I am and people either like me or they don't," Kathy said in her exit interview. "Rejection is not fun. I might burn the house down before I leave." We think she was joking there.
Retired interior designer Nancy, 61, had a tender Episode 2 Gerry moment, but somehow sensed romantic futility. She voiced her suspicions privately to Gerry that she wasn't going to make the cut.
"I'm really not going to dispute that," Gerry said, sounding like he was giving a statement from his legal counsel.
Power move for Nancy, with her boot cast from pickleball, to just drive off before the rose ceremony that saw April and Kathy leave.
Ellen: The pickleball ace won that showcase and heartily kissed Gerry afterward. She enjoyed more Gerry kisses in a one-on-one moment. Gerry had his eyes open for some. Just saying.
Faith: Working it, but frets about her lack of Gerry time.
Susan: Gerry gave emphatic kisses and a rose quartz gift.
Leslie: That ATV date went deep. Real deep.
Theresa: Kathy hates to be right about this. There's something real between Gerry and Theresa.
Sandra: Gerry hasn't truly realized her greatness, but there's time.
Editor's note: Part one of a five-part USA TODAY series revealing why America hasn't solved its long struggle with Type 2 diabetes.
For chef Robin Ray, newly married with young stepchildren, the turning point came when a stabbing chest pain sent her rushing to the emergency room. 
For Brian Castrucci, the gravity hit when the ER doc who had treated him for a near-heart attack a few weeks earlier gave him a big bear hug. “I didn’t think you’d make it,” the doctor said.
The crisis unspooled more slowly for James Haynes but started in 2019 when he stepped on a rusty nail and didn’t notice. 
The moments were turning points for all three to get serious about addressing their diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can’t properly regulate blood sugar, has become so common it’s almost considered inconsequential. More than 1 in 10 Americans have the disease (though many don't know) and another nearly 4 in 10 are at risk for it. In total, half of all adults and a quarter of teenagers have diabetes or pre-diabetes.
Its financial costs are astronomical. The country spends more than $300 billion a year to address diabetes, accounting for $1 out of every $4 spent on health care. 
And its personal tolls are even worse: heart attacks, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, double the risk of premature death. It also causes what’s known as “diabetes distress,” the daily burdens and emotional toll of living with and managing a chronic ailment that can lead to regular dips in energy, foggy thinking and depression, and a sense of isolation.
The most frustrating aspect of Type 2 diabetes, experts say, is that it has long been largely preventable and controllable. 
“We have made tremendous gains in understanding diabetes,” said Dr. Donald Berwick, a pediatrician and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “The best diabetes care can make a very big difference. You can’t say we don’t know what to do.”
And yet, diagnosed rates of Type 2 diabetes have soared over the past 25 years, and especially over the past dozen – particularly among working-age adults like Ray, Castrucci and Haynes. 
Roughly 40% of people who died early in the coronavirus pandemic had Type 2 diabetes, a rate four times higher than people without the disease. Even when elevated blood sugar levels are below the threshold for type 2 diabetes, the risk for heart disease jumps 30% to 50% compared with people with normal blood sugar levels. (Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 5% to 10% of diabetes, is caused by the immune system and is unrelated to diet or lifestyle.)
America’s failure to address Type 2 diabetes highlights larger problems with our food and medical systems, Berwick and other experts said.
A soda costs less than a bottle of water, a double cheeseburger and fries less than a carton of blueberries. Patients wait months for medical appointments only to see the back of a white coat for the short time they’re allotted. Treating disease costs society far more than preventing it but typically provides more profit for insurance companies, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry.
The USA TODAY Health team spoke with scores of health care providers, researchers, community leaders and patients for this five-part series to understand why Type 2 diabetes continues to worsen in America despite known solutions.
The answer isn't simple. It involves systemic problems facing everyone in society, not just those with diabetes: a food system designed to sell products; a medical system in which cutting off a leg is less expensive than saving it; the high cost of healthy living and the fact that breaking habits takes a lot more than just personal willpower.
This first story looks at what it takes for people to cope with or overcome the disease.
Then, we explore one community in a David vs. Goliath battle against a food system that fails to prioritize people's health.

Finally, we explore solutions, addressing why it will take a combination of education, medication, medical devices and improved food access to solve this national problem.
More in series:Solutions exist to end the Type 2 diabetes dilemma but too few get the help they need
The system is fixable, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.
But it will take "sensible action" from across many sectors, including health care, science, nutrition, business, public health and politics to change the financial and other incentives that drive so many Americans toward sickness instead of health.
"If we do it all, we could fix a lot of this in 10 years," said Mozaffarian, who serves on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. "If we do it incrementally or don't do it at all, we're all going to be toast in 50 years from diet-related illnesses and a depleted environment."
There’s no question personal responsibility plays a role in fighting diabetes. 
Haynes, Ray and Castrucci radically changed their lifestyles and sought help after their come-to-Jesus experiences. They’ve reduced their dependence on daily medication and hope to have saved themselves the horrors of more amputations, blindness and dialysis. They’ve extended their lives and improved the quality of that time.
But like many medical problems, the challenges of diabetes go well beyond individual responsibility and blame. 
“There are structural issues that we have to start paying attention to and addressing,” said Dr. Shivani Agarwal, an endocrinologist who specializes in research and treating young adults with diabetes at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Agarwal recently led a series of studies in the journal The Lancet that looked at diabetes rates around the world. 
Poverty, the studies showed, was a major driver of diabetes, along with racism and unequal access to healthy food and high-quality medical care.
Personal stories illustrate how these structural issues play out in the lives of so many Americans.
Ray, 45, director of culinary operations at HOSCO/North Sarah Food Hub in St. Louis, got weight-loss surgery and then put her culinary expertise to good use.  
Castrucci, 49, who runs a public health nonprofit outside Washington, D.C., used his advantages provided by his work, salary and insurance to “buy” himself better health.
 “I’m healthy because of privilege – not diet, not exercise, not determination,” he said.
Haynes, 58, a former truck driver and maintenance technician in Gulfport, Mississippi, has fewer material assets, but his attitude and the advantages he does have explain why he's still around, despite all he has been through.
“It’s going to be all right after a while, as long as I keep this spirit,” he said.
Ray’s love for food began when she was 8 years old, watching Julia Child on TV. During family gatherings, she would run around taking everyone’s dinner order. Then she’d scurry back to the kitchen with a notepad full of scribbles. 
Throughout her life, she made fried chicken, pork chops, baked mac and cheese, collard greens, and even a whole roasted chicken filled with wild rice and two sticks of butter – everything that made her soul sing. 
In her world, food was home. Food was family. Food was love. 
But that was some pretty tough love. 
In 2002, Ray was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Her father, grandmother, aunts and uncles all had diabetes. She knew what it meant.
“For you to tell me I can’t have ice blue raspberry Kool-Aid was like you shut down my world,” Ray said. “I didn’t want to accept it. So, I ate, because you eat through your emotions.” 
She didn't dwell on the diagnosis and continued with life. Her culinary career took her to Italy, where she learned and fell even more in love with food. She returned to St. Louis, got married and became a mom to her husband’s two children ‒ “beautiful bonus babies,” as she described them. Through the years, she continued to express love through cooking and eating. 
In 2015, a stabbing chest pain sent her to the emergency room. Doctors assured Ray she hadn’t had a heart attack, but they warned that her life was on the line. At 5-foot-2, she weighed 334 pounds and had an A1C, a measure of average blood sugar of 11%, well above the 6.5% cutoff to be considered diabetic. Her diabetes – and her diet – were out of control. 
“That scared me. … It was gut-wrenching and terrifying,” she said. “I’m fighting against something that’s fighting me back and I did not know how to win.” 
She and her primary care doctor decided she would pursue weight loss surgery. 
But she also decided to use her culinary prowess to transform her diet. She reconfigured favorite foods, substituting healthier ingredients: Collard greens cooked in smoked fats or ham hocks turned into a kale, turnip and rutabaga recipe flavored with natural chicken broth fat, oils and seasonings. 
She fostered her feelings into new recipes and brought them to North Sarah Food Hub, which partnered with Barnes-Jewish Hospital to make packaged, pre-made meals for St. Louis residents with diabetes and limited access to fresh food.
“I had to restructure the food that I put in my mouth. I had to think about what I was eating and how I was eating and how it was going to be good for my body,” she said. “I became excited about food again, and food became a joy.” 
It isn’t always easy, of course. Ray admits to an occasional cookie craving. But now she takes the time to think about how her body processes that cookie and whether it’s worthwhile. 
She hopes her cooking can help other people make the same transformation she did. Her staff at North Sarah helps her create new recipes for others. She wants to provide nourishment that allows people to avoid illness and medicine. 
“Nobody wants to take 55 pills, nobody wants to feel like a patient, but how do you fix that? It’s by our food,” she said. “That should be what we’re teaching our community and our culture and our children. … It’s not always about the macaroni noodle with a smile, it’s about what’s good for your body.” 
Castrucci is a third-generation diabetes patient. The lifetime risk of developing Type 2 diabetes if a parent has it is 40%. If both parents have it, the risk jumps to 70%.
He knew he was at risk, but he pushed his luck, he said, by eating poorly during the pandemic and falling out of his exercise routine. With the luxury of working from home, walking to the kitchen and bathroom was often the extent of his daily activity.
On Feb. 14, 2022 – Valentine’s Day – he went to an urgent care clinic, concerned his breathing trouble meant he had bronchitis. His blood pressure measured 210 over 110, well above normal levels that top out at 120 over 80. A chest X-ray showed fluid filling his lungs, leading to congestive heart failure. 
The clinic sent him straight to a local emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a blockage of the left descending artery – a clogged artery made worse by diabetes. If he had waited any longer, he would have had a massive heart attack, his doctor later told him.
After his release from the hospital, he went to the drugstore to fill his new prescriptions. The pharmacist told him she couldn’t fill one because it would cost $1,000. He’d have to wait until his insurance approved it. “Please fill it,” he said. She stressed the cost. “Fill it,” he pleaded, putting the charge on his credit card.
Medication helped him lose 70 pounds in three months. When his local drugstore ran out of the weight-loss drug, he easily drove to another pharmacy and then another to find what he needed. 
His 100 hours of high-quality cardiac rehabilitation were fully covered by insurance.  
"For my midlife crisis, I got healthy," Castrucci said.
He could devote all his energy to getting well because he didn’t have to focus on how to afford his care. “(I) paid almost nothing for the whole episode,” he said, “and never worried about it because I have really good insurance.” 
Even so, Castrucci pays out-of-pocket for a cardiologist and an endocrinologist because the best ones near him don’t accept insurance.
Every time he goes to Walgreens to refill his medications, Castrucci said, he sees someone turned away because they can’t afford their prescriptions. When they finally show up in the emergency room, “because they will,” they will cost the system far more, he said.
“Health outcomes are dictated by economics. It’s a whole side of privilege that we don’t always talk about.”
On the day Haynes stepped on a rusty nail in 2019, he walked all day as the nail pierced the sole of his sneaker and then his foot. By the time he took off his shoe that night, his foot was infected. He landed in the hospital for two months as doctors and nurses tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to get the infection and Haynes’ blood sugar under control.
By the time he was released, he knew enough about Type 2 diabetes to realize his daily blood sugar levels – typically in the mid-400s – were four times above what he had been told to shoot for.
But nothing he did or ate seemed to make a difference. He had long since traded ribs for salads, beer for water. 
His wife, Angela, barely noticed when James started wearing multiple pairs of socks, pouring powder on his feet and buying bigger shoes. His feet tingled a lot, he said, but he was coping with it. 
James ended up in the emergency room again, dehydrated and in need of antibiotics. The doctor amputated the baby toe on his right foot, leaving a large open wound. 
"We're going to leave this open because we'll probably have to take more,” Angela remembered the doctor saying. “I didn't like that we're not going to try to save anything, we're just going to start cutting.”
James was fading.
His arm muscles shriveled and he lost his Popeye physique. Antibiotics left him looking sickly, his voice so weak Angela could barely hear him. “I felt like I was watching my husband slowly dying,” she said.
Finally, taking her doctor sister’s advice, Angela emailed Dr. Foluso Fakorede’s office to ask for an appointment. She thought it would take months to get James in to see the heart disease specialist, but the office called and asked if they could come the next day. 
The Hayneses would end up going back to see Fakorede many times − sometimes twice in one week, driving more than five hours each way from Gulfport north to Cleveland, Mississippi.
“We started looking forward to these visits because there was always hope,” Angela Haynes said, though she felt guilty they were taking up so much of the important doctor’s time. 
Fakorede, who is on a personal mission to save people with diabetes from amputations, noticed what other doctors had missed. Haynes had blockages in blood vessels on both legs. 
Once he got the blood flowing again, Haynes began to feel better. His flesh returned to its normal color. The wound started healing at last. Walking became easier.
Then disaster struck again. 
On July 2, 2022, Haynes caught COVID-19. "Everything went downhill after that," he said.
During his 13-day illness, the bacteria in his foot raged out of control. He ended up back in the hospital and unable to withstand the long drive to Fakorede’s office.
Every week, a surgeon would come to the door of his hospital room and before even stepping all the way in ask Haynes whether he had decided to get his leg amputated. 
"This is my leg. I was born with this. And you're walking in like you're cutting a piece of cake," Haynes said.
He was worried about how he’d get around, how he’d be able to work to support his family if he had only one leg. No one took the time to explain why they thought the leg needed to come off or how he’d cope without it, Haynes said. 
In late November, he was finally sent home in a wheelchair. But just three weeks later, as he was getting out of the car after wound care, his right leg gave out and he fell to the ground. Back at the hospital, Haynes was told his foot was broken, essentially beyond repair. He agreed to a below-the-knee amputation.
Released right before Christmas, he spent the next three weeks in bed wondering how he’d manage the rest of his life.
Finally, it looked as if his luck might be turning around.
With the leg gone, his diabetes improved. His blood sugar dropped into the 120s or one-teens. His blurry vision cleared up.
During his long hospital stay, he befriended nurses and learned about a program for people who needed prostheses. The man who ran it called early in the year and said he had received a donated leg. If it fit Haynes, he could have it while waiting for insurance to pay for a personalized one. Miraculously, it did. 
Haynes spent the next six months teaching himself to walk again. The donor leg was heavy and uncomfortable. He wasn't mobile enough to hold down a job.
One late spring night, picking up dinner at a nearby restaurant, he headed to the bathroom for a pit stop. A sink had been leaking all day and Haynes slipped in the puddle, falling backward.
He's still recovering from the resulting wrist surgery.
He and Angela are living – barely – off her part-time salary as a secretary and a church organist.
Haynes has tried "at least three or four times" to receive government assistance, but they keep losing his paperwork, or not believing he's disabled, though he once checked himself out of the hospital and arrived at an appointment in his wheelchair to prove he didn't have a leg.
Still, he clings to his faith and the positive attitude he has long used to cheer up himself and others. These are his secret weapons against diabetes and everything else life throws his way.
"I try to put a smile on other people's faces," he said. "It keeps my day going."

We can't wait to see what you've been reading!
Hamas and Israel have been blaming each other for a deadly blast at a Gaza hospital complex.
President Joe Biden backed up Israel’s statements on Wednesday as he visited Tel Aviv. Biden said he was “outraged and saddened” by the loss of life in Gaza City. But he said U.S. intelligence indicated that Israel was not behind the explosion.
Here's a look at what happened, and what the different parties are saying:
An explosion in a courtyard and parking lot adjacent to al-Ahli Hospital in a Gaza City suburb reportedly killed or injured hundreds of patients and people in the vicinity.
Mohammed Abu Selmia − general director of Shifa Hospital, where the wounded and dead were transferred after the explosion − said early Wednesday that he believed the death toll was close to 250, with hundreds more wounded, The Associated Press reported.
The American Friends of the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which operates the medical center, said in a statement Tuesday evening that hundreds of staff, patients, and refugees who were sheltering at Ahli Arab Hospital were killed and wounded.
Palestinians have been seeking refuge in and around hospitals from the Israeli bombardment of Gaza prompted by the Oct. 7 Hamas rampage that killed 1,400 people in Israeli territory. More than 3,000 people have been killed and more than 12,500 have been injured in Gaza, according to its health ministry.

The U.S. said Wednesday that its intelligence assessments indicated Israel was not behind the hospital explosion.
“While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,” National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement.
Air Force Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said separately that the Defense Department’s intelligence assessment is that Israel was not responsible for the explosion.
USA TODAY received more detail about the U.S. perspective from U.S. officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. Imagery that shows the lack of a bomb crater and heat trails from rockets being fired inside Gaza have led officials to believe that the blast that killed hundreds at a hospital there Tuesday came from a rocket fired by Palestinian militants.
The explosives in Israeli bombs, even in the smallest version, leave a crater when they explode, according to U.S. officials who have been briefed on intelligence findings about the explosion. Sensors can detect the heat generated during the blast off a rocket or missile, a trail known a “heat signature.” Israeli airstrikes rely principally on joint direct attack munitions, precision-guided weapons developed by the Pentagon. The bombs rely on global position system (GPS) guidance to strike targets with a high degree of accuracy in all weather conditions. The evidence taken together has led these military officials to conclude that Israel did not attack the hospital, the officials said.
President Joe Biden said Wednesday, while visiting Israel, that Pentagon officials had shown him data that concluded Israel was not responsible for the explosion. The explosion at the hospital has prompted anger and protests across the region directed at Israel and the United States.
The Israeli military denied involvement and released video, audio and other information to support its claim that the explosion resulted from a misfired missile from the Islamic Jihad, a militant group that sometimes cooperates with Hamas and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. In a video posted to X, formerly Twitter, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) compares examples of craters caused by IDF ordnance to the damage near the hospital.
Israel Defense Forces posted a video claiming the rocket originated from Gaza. The footage was posted on X with text that reads: "RAW FOOTAGE: A rocket aimed at Israel misfired and exploded at 18:59 − the same moment a hospital was hit in Gaza."
Hamas has blamed Israel for Tuesday's explosion, and its health ministry says the blast killed at least 500 people. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, pushed back on the Israeli narrative in a video posted by The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets.
In it, Mansour appears to be speaking from the United Nations, surrounded by other Arab diplomats, and he says: “It is a lie. And they, the Israeli spokesperson of the army about a week ago made a statement in which he said evacuate the hospitals, the hospitals are target and in fact they hit one hospital a week ago. So their intentions is evacuate or hospitals will be hit. And they are responsible for that crime and they cannot fabricate stories to deal with it.”
Is there any kind of independent investigative team that can resolve the matter by cutting through the politics and examining the forensic evidence to find out who is responsible? The short answer is yes, but with some caveats.
"The essential point is that time is of the essence here for an accurate investigation of the site," said David Scheffer, an international law expert who served as the first U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues. "You would need a 'dream team' of forensic scientists skilled enough to look at the evidence on the ground and that which has been put forward by all sides, including Israel, the Biden administration and Hamas."
Scheffer told USA TODAY, given the superheated climate around Israel's intensifying war with Hamas, "how would you create the team quickly that would be acceptable to both sides so that it doesn't ignite political fires given its composition?"
Options might include the International Criminal Court, the U.N.-affiliated Commission of Inquiry, the International Commission of Jurists, and the Commission for International Justice and Accountability, but all have their challenges.

Six weeks before Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel, a deputy political advisor in the group did an interview with a Lebanese news outlet. Tucked into it was a specific warning.  
“We are preparing for an all-out war,” Saleh al-Arouri said of Hamas. “We are closely discussing the prospects of this war with all relevant parties.” 
At the time, his statements were couched as a caution. Israel had plans including targeted killings of leaders of the Palestinian resistance group that controls Gaza, he said. If it followed through, Arouri warned, “a regional war” would ensue.  
Those Israeli provocations never happened. Yet by mid-October, an all-out war was under way. Hamas led a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,300 people including more than 30 Americans and taking at least 200 hostages, and a mounting response from Israel now brings more bloodshed.   
Already, Israel has struck a range of targets, and by mid-week announced at least six key Hamas operatives had been “eliminated.” 
But Israeli authorities also have launched an international manhunt for another Hamas leader, USA TODAY has learned: Saleh al-Arouri.  
They’re pursuing him not just for his insider knowledge of the attack, but for his ties to others – possibly those “relevant parties” he cited in August.  
The attack went far beyond what was expected from Hamas alone: A mass border invasion. Drones and paragliders. Withering rocket fire. Precise raids on military surveillance, communications and intelligence hubs. Those plans bear the hallmarks of sophisticated backers from the outside.  
Current and former intelligence officials say Arouri sits at a strategic intersection of three entities: Hamas; Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based terrorist group that is considered the world’s most formidable; and Iran, the world’s deadliest state sponsor of terrorism. 
If Iran and Hezbollah were involved in the Oct. 7 attack – as security authorities now suspect – someone from Hamas coordinated their assistance. And current and former U.S. and Israeli intelligence officials, and a USA TODAY review of government documents and court records, all point to Arouri as a key link.  
"Today most of the money that is going to Hamas is coming from Iran, and with the money comes the influence too," said Ehud “Udi” Levy, who served for more than 30 years in Israeli intelligence, including as head of the Mossad’s Economic Warfare Division that goes after terrorists' money. "And the Iran man inside Hamas is Saleh al-Arouri." 
More:Is Iran behind Hamas terrorist attacks? What it would mean for US and Middle East security
While experts said they do not yet know what specific role Arouri might have played on Oct. 7, they see him at the heart of a changing − and alarming − dynamic in which these three U.S.-designated terrorist entities are teaming up and further destabilizing the Middle East under the direction of Tehran.  
“With him, I cannot go into details about the involvement,” Danny Danon, an Israeli lawmaker who sits on the Knesset foreign affairs committee, told USA TODAY this week when asked about Arouri. “But I can tell you that Iran is heavily involved with everything that's happening in Gaza – the training, equipment, funding and method of fighting,”  
“We have knowledge of collaboration between Tehran, Beirut and Gaza,” said Danon, who was also Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations. “We are worried that the technology came from Tehran to Beirut and to Gaza.”
And Arouri, he said, “was heavily involved in that triangle.” 
Arouri was a founding commander of the the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas that carried out the attacks.  
Despite having spent years under U.S. terror sanctions, and with a $5 million State Department bounty on his head, he has traveled the region, including in and out of Iran, and collaborated with terrorist figures including the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Qasem Soleimani, before he was killed by a U.S. airstrike. 
And Arouri helped build and lead a new Hamas coalition with Iran and Hezbollah that so alarmed Israel, it sought emergency help from the United Nations Security Council in 2017 and again in 2018 to stop him.  
Arouri is based in Lebanon, where numerous media reports say Hamas leaders met with top Iranian and Hezbollah officials as recently as April. Now, he’s a prime target as Israel seeks out the strategists behind Oct. 7. 
But even after being watched by international authorities for decades, Arouri might not be easy to catch or kill. 
“They are looking for him like the Americans were looking for Bin Laden" after Sept. 11, Levy said. "He is a shadow guy. He is under the radar. And believe me, these are the dangerous people, people like that." 
Publicly, Israel is pointing the finger at more well-known Hamas figures based in Gaza, including Yahya Sinwar and military chief Mohammed Deif. 
“Yahya Sinwar, the ruler of the Gaza Strip, decided on this horrible attack, and therefore he — and the entire hierarchy under him — are dead men," Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said Oct. 12 in his first public statement since the war began. “We will attack them, we will dismantle them, dismantle their system.” 
Arouri lacks the same profile. One of his current titles is deputy chief of Hamas’ political bureau, but sources say Arouri’s role in Hamas has become much more prominent than that. In addition to still playing a role in the Qassam Brigades, Arouri has spent years helping rebuild Hamas operations in the other Palestinian territory blockaded by Israel, the West Bank, according to former Israeli and U.S. counterterrorism officials who have tracked him.  
And, they say, he acts as a chief deputy of sorts to Ismail Haniyeh, one of several Hamas leaders based in Qatar as they try to do political outreach for the group, including to Iran and Hezbollah. 
Five days after the attacks, Arouri offered Al Jazeera Arabic some of the first inside details about the operation, including how 1,200 members of the Qassam Brigades had been given “detailed instructions” about their targets, the Israeli military’s Gaza Brigade, just across the border from the Gaza Strip. 
“We were surprised that the Gaza Brigade collapsed in less than three hours, faster than we expected,” Arouri said.  
Officially, Iran has denied playing a role in the attack even as it congratulates Hamas. President Joe Biden told 60 Minutes on Oct. 15 that there’s no evidence “at this point” that Iran was behind the attack. Israeli officials have made similar comments, stressing that the investigation is in its early stages. 
But U.S. and Israeli intelligence analysts say that if anyone could give the group the ability to launch such stunning land, air and sea attacks against the Israeli military, it would be Iran and its Revolutionary Guard. Even as the hunt for Arouri continued this week, Iran and Hezbollah both raised prospects of openly entering the conflict to respond to Israel’s strikes at Gaza. 
Arouri’s role as an alliance-builder among terrorist organizations has been known to Israel since at least 2018. And his role in raising money and plotting terrorist attacks for Hamas has been known to both governments for a generation.
“It's not just the guys who pulled the trigger or approved the battle plan or gave the final order to do it but the people who are directing all of the strategy and really promoting the (anti-Israel) militarism,” said former FBI counterterrorism analyst and U.S. Treasury terror finance official Matthew Levitt. “And that's Saleh al-Arouri.” 
Yet he has evaded authorities for years.  
“He knows that if he steps anywhere close, we will kill him,” a former top Israeli intelligence official until earlier this year told USA TODAY. "He was on the run. You can imagine that there were several plans regarding that, but it just didn't happen.”  
Born in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Arouri became a fixture in pro-Palestinian activity in the mid-1980s at Hebron University, where he studied Sharia, or Islamic law. 
Security officials in Israel and the U.S. say Arouri joined Hamas soon after it was formed in late 1987 at the beginning of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising. He quickly graduated from being a leader of its on-campus youth organization to founding the Qassam Brigades in the name of establishing an Islamic Palestinian state in place of Israel. 
By the early 1990s, the Qassam Brigades began conducting anti-Israel attacks in the Palestinian territories and in Israel, U.S. and Israeli documents and interviews show. Those included large-scale bombings and rocket attacks, according to the U.S. Directorate of National Intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center, which it oversees.  
In 2003, the Justice Department named Arouri as an unindicted co-conspirator in a racketeering case against three Hamas operatives in Chicago who were charged with financing terrorism. In the indictment, Arouri was described as a high-ranking Hamas military leader who had received tens of thousands of dollars for terrorist activities including buying weapons.  
But Arouri was being investigated by the U.S. even before then.  
“The U.S. government has been aware of Arouri since the late 1990s when he was senior activist in the West Bank,” said Levitt, who worked at the FBI from 1998 to 2001. 
Israeli authorities detained and incarcerated Arouri three times, though he continued his Hamas activity even while in an Israeli prison in Ashkelon, the Justice Department indictment alleged. 
Arouri was arrested again in 2007 but freed in 2011 when Israel released more than 1,000 prisoners in exchange for an Israeli soldier who had been captured by Hamas in 2006.  
All told, Arouri ultimately spent about 15 years in Israeli prisons, Levy, Levitt and others say.  
Upon his final release, he was forced out of Gaza for being a continuing threat to Israel and moved to the Syrian capital of Damascus to join Hamas leadership in exile there.   
With the outbreak of civil war in Syria, Arouri was on the move again. He spent time in Turkey, where he began building an operational Hamas presence, in Qatar, where Hamas’ political leadership resided, and Lebanon. 
In 2014, Arouri announced that Hamas was responsible for a June 2014 terrorist attack that included the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, one of which was dual U.S.-Israeli citizen Naftali Fraenkel, the State Department said. He publicly praised the murders, which sparked Hamas’ month-long war with Israel that year, as a “heroic operation,” State Department documents show. 
With his alleged involvement of the murder of a U.S. citizen, Arouri was high on the U.S. government’s list of terror targets. 
In September 2015, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned him as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, saying he served as “a key financier and financial facilitator for Hamas military cells.”  
U.S. documents in support of that action say Arouri directed Hamas’ military operations in the West Bank, and that he had been linked to several terrorist attacks, hijackings, and kidnappings. 
In June 2017, Qatar expelled six Hamas members, including Arouri, the State Department said in its annual Country Reports on Terrorism. The move came amid intense pressure on Qatar by Washington to crack down on its longstanding role in providing safe haven for terrorists. 
Two months later, Arouri was instrumental in patching up relations between Hamas and Tehran.  
Iran’s history of providing money, weapons, training and technological support to Hamas actually goes back to the early 1990s, said Jonathan Schanzer, a former Treasury Department terror finance analyst and author of four books on Middle East politics.  
Arouri “put to rest” a feud with Iran over the civil war in Syria and began to forge closer links with Hezbollah from his new base of operations in Lebanon, said Schanzer. 
In November 2018, the U.S. State Department’s Rewards for Justice program offered up to a $5 million bounty for information on Arouri.  
At the time, the State Department said, Arouri was “currently living freely in Lebanon, where he reportedly is working with Qasem Soleimani, leader of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force.” 
Israel was so alarmed by these developments that Danon, as its ambassador to the United Nations, sent two urgent requests for intervention, the first in 2017, to the president of the UN Security Council.  
“The increasing cooperation between Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran constitutes a major threat not only to Israel but to the stability and security of the entire region,” Danon wrote in his May 11, 2018 follow-up letter, a copy of which was obtained by USA TODAY.  
The new alliance, including meetings of top operatives and pledges of mutual support, Danon wrote, was being led by Arouri and Saeed Izadi, head of the Palestinian Branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force.  
Hamas also was building its own military force covertly in Lebanon, Danon wrote, warning that it by then had built the infrastructure it needed to manufacture its own missiles and drones. 
In the recent past, one of Arouri’s jobs has been to bring Hamas fighters from the Qassam Brigades to Lebanon for specialized training, Danon said in an interview this week.  
Arouri now travels to and from Iran but mostly stays in Lebanon, where Hezbollah’s power as a political and military force provide him with protection, former security officials told USA TODAY.  
Asked if Israel knows his current whereabouts, Danon said: “I cannot comment on that.”  
On Oct. 7, the kind of weaponry Danon warned about – including drones – figured in the sophisticated Hamas attack, launched from Gaza. As Hamas forces raided Israeli towns, one of their first targets was the coastal city of Ashkelon, where Arouri had spent so many years in jail.   
In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, the FBI and other U.S. agencies have joined Israel in its response – and its investigation, according to Attorney General Merrick Garland and other Biden administration officials. 
That includes the hunt for at least 13 Americans who may be still held hostage by Hamas, the dragnet for Hamas foot soldiers believed to be hiding inside Israel and the broader investigation into who orchestrated and led the sophisticated invasion, two U.S. intelligence officials told USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing investigations. 
If the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S. are any guide, it could be months or even years before authorities answer those questions in detail.  
Iran has signaled a more aggressive approach to Israel, including a warning this week about potential Iranian action against Israel for its response in Gaza. Hezbollah has issued similar warnings. 
Iran’s suspected involvement in the planning of the Gaza raid has been widely reported. Gen. Esmail Ghaani, who is in charge of supervising Iran’s network of proxy militias as head of the country’s paramilitary Quds Force, repeatedly traveled to Lebanon for covert sessions with leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, the New York Times reported from the region.  
Iran also has supported Hamas militarily, it said, “and has helped it design and produce a domestic missile and rocket system to match the capabilities and material available in Gaza.”  
And Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah “held an hourslong online meeting in March with an elite group of strategists from all the Iran-backed militias and told them to get ready for a war with Israel with a scope and reach — including a ground invasion — that would mark a new era,” the Times reported, citing two participants from Iran and Syria.  
But media coverage has not yet focused on Arouri’s role in those relationships.  
Neither did senior Trump administration Iran official Richard Goldberg when he mentioned the existence of a Lebanon-based intelligence center for the three groups during a public event Monday.
Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah, Goldberg said, “have coordinated a fusion cell in Beirut since 2021 where they put everybody together in a war room, an intel room operations room, they go in and out of Lebanon… and they coordinated it all.” 
The former top Israeli security official confirmed to USA TODAY the existence of the joint Iran-Hezbollah-Hamas intelligence center in Beirut.
“They have representatives there, they coordinate their actions, they share information, they share intel. The purpose of that, of course, is to enhance their joint capabilities,” the former official, who left Israeli government earlier this year, said in an interview.
Asked if Arouri played a role in the center, the official said, “Yes of course. I'm not sure if he is the person that is representing (Hamas) there but clearly he has participated in joint meetings over there.”
Goldberg, the Director for Countering Iranian Weapons of Mass Destruction for the White House National Security Council from 2019 to 2020, said he believed the strong cooperation between Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah helped them keep the plot away from Israeli intelligence, just like al-Qaeda kept the 9/11 plot away from the U.S. 
“And so if you don't have any intel on the planning of the attack, it stands to reason you have no intel on Iran's involvement in said attack plans,” Goldberg said. “Of course you don't have the intel. You’re not going to find the intel. There was no intel (because) there was a catastrophic intelligence failure.” 
Rep. Brad Schneider (D-IL), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also said all signs point to Iran, given its role in funding, training and equipping Hamas fighters. 
“If you breed an attack dog, you train an attack dog, you equip an attack dog, maybe you're surprised that the dog breaks through the fence and attacks, but you're still responsible for that attack,” Schneider said. “And Iran has been training Hamas, has been equipping Hamas, funding Hamas, and this has the fingerprints of (Iran) training and planning all the way through.” 
The hunt for Arouri may reveal more of those plans, but for now, he appears only in his media statements.  
Speaking to Al Jazeera, just after the attack, he described his view of the Israeli response to come. 
"The occupation knows that its invasion of Gaza will turn the battle into a catastrophe for its army,” he said, according to a Palestine Chronicle translation. “Before our operation began, the defensive plan was ready, and it is much stronger than the offensive plan. ... We do not see a future for this battle except victory." 
How do you protect innocent civilians while conducting effective urban military operations against an enemy who is integrated into the civilian population and entrenched in a location’s infrastructure? 
Israeli civilian and military decision-makers face this question anew after Hamas’ unprecedented attack from Gaza into southern Israel on Oct. 7. The explosion at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday that killed hundreds of people points up the dangers faced by civilians in an active war zone.
Israel’s initial answer to the question of how to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza was to tell more than a million Palestinian residents to flee their homes and head south. Barring an 11th-hour mass exodus from northern Gaza, Israel will face the possibility of further civilian casualties. 
Fighting urban battles amid civilian populations is certainly an issue U.S. decision-makers have grappled with during military operations over the two decades since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. And there are lessons about protecting civilians that Israel could take from America's recent experience.
Among them: Consider potential civilian losses when planning airstrikes, seek improved methods of collecting and deploying intelligence, and provide safe passage for civilians away from war zones.
So far, more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and nearly 4,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed in the latest conflict. Despite the ferocity of the Hamas attack and the Israeli response, the moral obligation to reduce civilian harm cannot be ignored.
Urban battles are not unusual occurrences in the Middle East. The U.S.-led battle against the Islamic State terrorist organization for Raqqa, Syria, in 2017 provides parallels to the Gaza conflict in terms of environment, adversary and humanitarian implications.
Our research on that ISIS conflict, conducted with an eye toward reducing civilian harm, suggests that military effectiveness can be retained while protecting civilians and reducing damage to civilian infrastructure.
Operating in densely populated urban environments is incredibly difficult even for experienced military units such as the Israel Defense Forces, which have operated in Gaza before. Hamas, not unlike ISIS, has a history of using civilian infrastructure as a defense against Israeli military operations.
Hamas invaded my brother's home.Now my family is held hostage in Gaza.
Organizations like ISIS and Hamas know their adversaries are committed to reducing civilian harm and take advantage of this adherence to international law and norms. Before the Battle of Raqqa, the coalition along with Syrian Defense Forces partners initially encircled the city to weaken ISIS fighters rather than allowing them to escape to the next stronghold. However, this also prevented the departure of civilian Raqqa residents.
In Syria, ISIS tactical facilities were often located near civilian infrastructure, requiring individual strike decisions to consider ways to minimize civilian harm. Such considerations could help reduce civilian casualties in Gaza as well, though civilian deaths and infrastructure damage can never be eliminated, even with precision weapons. In Raqqa, collateral damage to infrastructure made recovery and reconstruction operations difficult and time consuming.
Urban fighting in a location you do not control, especially when reliant upon air support, also makes it difficult to collect, verify and share real-time intelligence.
In Syria, intelligence efforts were hampered by civilians moving across Raqqa to escape bombardments, searching for shelter, food and new places to live. This also is now true in the Gaza Strip, one of the most densely populated geographies in the world. 
I've seen firsthand the oppression:I'm a Palestinian American. I almost gave up hope people will see the humanity in us.
An enhanced focus on the task of gathering and leveraging intelligence is critical, despite the many challenges facing the Israeli intelligence services in Gaza. An examination of U.S. intelligence shortcomings in Syria suggests the need for improved intelligence-specific tradecraft and training, enhanced efforts to gather and validate open-source information and improved civilian casualty assessments.
In Syria, the U.S.-led coalition acted on the advice of the Syrian Defense Forces and opened humanitarian corridors out of Raqqa as the battle lasted longer than expected. This was critical for evacuations of civilians and reducing civilian deaths.
While concerns persisted over the possibility of escaping ISIS fighters who could regroup in other locations, the corridors reduced the civilian injury and death toll in Raqqa and its environs.
Similar escape routes could save civilian lives in Gaza as well, though the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt is now damaged and closed, according to aid workers. This leaves residents of Gaza trapped and unable to escape the aerial bombardment from Israel.
Israel’s new demand that civilians flee applies to northern Gaza, but southern Gaza lacks the infrastructure to support the additional civilians, who would still remain trapped. 
The United States regularly encourages all partners to limit civilian harm during conflict, including in current hotspots such as Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s statements during his visit to Tel Aviv and Arab capitals, along with efforts to open the Rafah border crossing for humanitarian aid and evacuations, reminded the global community of the rules-based order and the criticality of shielding innocent civilians during conflict. 
One of the distinctions between the international community and organizations such as Hamas and ISIS is its commitment to reducing and limiting civilian harm during conflict. While extracting vengeance through an eye-for-eye approach may seem legitimate, even necessary, in the moment, listening to better angels could help reduce civilian harm in the long run.

The brutal Hamas invasion of Israel and the resulting conflict in Gaza have opened the floodgates for hate incidents – both in real life and online, targeting Jewish people and Muslims alike – over the last two weeks. In Chicago, a man fatally attacked a 6-year-old boy and wounded his mother on Saturday because they were Muslims, police say. America’s synagogues and Jewish community centers are on high alert, while Jewish targets have been attacked in several countries across the world. It’s the week in extremism. 
The Justice Department has opened a federal hate crime investigation into the fatal stabbing of 6-year-old Wadea Al Fayoume in Chicago last Saturday. Wadea and his mother, Hanaan Shahin, who was also seriously injured, were attacked by 71-year-old Joseph Czuba, who stabbed them dozens of times with a “military style knife,” according to Attorney General Merrick Garland.
As USA TODAY reported this week, bigotry and violence against Palestinian Americans is also reportedly spiking across the country. Threats have been made against Palestinian American communities in Dearborn, Michigan, Los Angeles, New York and Portland, among other cities.
The Anti-Defamation League is keeping a running tally of incidents of anti-Semitism and violence against Jewish communities across the globe. Also this week, a study finds widespread antisemitic views and support for political violence in the U.S.. 
Last week, USA TODAY reported on a surge in online hatred directed at both Jews and Muslims. A new study from the Global Project on Hate and Extremism found that hate is also spiking on the largely unregulated messageboard 4Chan and other platforms.
That’s how many hate crime incidents were reported in 2022, according to the FBI’s deeply flawed Uniform Crime Reports.

JERUSALEM − They don't agree on a lot of things. They agree on this: what they have seen and had to do, no one should have to see or do.
Two weeks into the conflict that began when members of Hamas massacred civilians in rural communities and at a music festival on Israel's border with the Gaza Strip, Israelis and Palestinians have been collecting, weeping over and burying their dead with as much dignity as they can in trying, unpredictable and dangerous circumstances.
In Israel, where some 1,400 civilians and soldiers have died and where all Jews are by religious tenet supposed to be buried immediately after death − a few days at most − this has involved emergency responders going to great lengths to recover victims which they have discovered in scenes of unspeakable horror, sometimes in locations where fighting is still taking place.
In Gaza, where at least 3,500 Palestinians have been killed and large parts of the territory controlled by Hamas is in ruins as a result of Israel's bombing campaign, this has meant families resorting to makeshift graveyards dug in empty lots and authorities storing bodies in ice cream freezers as morgues run full, doctors and witnesses say.
'I won't condemn Hamas':Some Palestinians find it hard to denounce attacks on Israel
"I'm not eating. I'm not sleeping," said Israeli search and rescue volunteer Yossi Landau, 55, as he struggled not to weep Wednesday recounting some of what he witnessed in villages in southern Israel in the immediate aftermath of the nation's deadliest ever attack.
Meanwhile, in Gaza, photographer Ali Jadallah said "we have reached a catastrophic situation," where Israel's bombs are killing scores of Palestinian families − sometimes entombing them in their collapsed homes; sometimes leaving their mutilated bodies scattered among the ruins.
On both sides of the Israel-Gaza border, faith traditions define the rules of burial. For Jews, who believe the dead must be watched until buried, and that every part of a body must be buried, the idea of an unguarded corpse is an almost unthinkable lapse. Within the Muslim tradition, the body is wrapped in a shroud and the head is positioned to face Mecca with the eyes and mouth closed.
Jadallah said he's lost nine family members to Israeli airstrikes, according to updates he's been posting on his Instagram account. He filmed himself this week as he was driving in his car. Across the back seat his father, killed in one of those Israeli strikes, lay dead.

"We have no funeral cars, no ambulances," he said.
"I'm taking him alone (to bury him). I know people can't attend the funeral. No one can. But please pray for him. He was a decent and beloved man."
In Israel, Landau works for ZAKA, a volunteer organization whose members are almost all ultra-orthodox Jews. Its mission is to collect the remains of the dead, including their blood if they can, so they can be buried in accordance with Jewish religious law.
For the past three decades, Landau has deployed for ZAKA all over the world. He was in New York during the 9/11 attacks. He has responded to natural disasters in India. He has rushed many times to the scene of suicide bombings to collect body parts.
He helped recover the dead in Surfside, Fla., when a 12-story condominium building collapsed early in the morning of June 24, 2021, causing the deaths of 98 people.
Israel-Hamas war:She spent her life advocating for Palestinian rights. Then Hamas came
Yet Landau said that what he encountered in several of the kibbutzim that dot the frontlines where Israeli civilians and soldiers were killed by Hamas on Oct. 7 was more than he could bear.
"I broke. I blanked out," he said.
Landau said that in one home, in Kibbutz Be'eri, he saw small children as young as six with their hands tied behind their back in the same room where their parents were also executed. They were missing fingers and eyes. In another home, he found a pregnant woman lying face down in a pool of blood. When Landau and other ZAKA volunteers turned the woman over, they found her belly had been "butchered open" and the unborn child connected to her had been stabbed.
"I don't know if you know − and you should never know − what it means to separate parts of a burned body," he said, referring to the charred remains of people he came across in vehicles and safe rooms in Be'eri and other kibbutzim in the days after Hamas' assault.
The killing scenes Landau described were corroborated by half a dozen other ZAKA volunteers who were present in Be'eri and elsewhere with him as part of their emergency response.
Cell phone videos, security footage, photographs from residents and accounts of witnesses who survived the initial attacks have also helped establish with some specificity the brutality of the Hamas attacks on civilians on Israel's southern border.
ZAKA volunteers are generally prohibited, as a matter of religious custom, from photographing the work they do. However, Israel's military has asked them to document it as part of the process of collecting evidence and in case it is helpful in identifying remains.
A ZAKA volunteer named Nachman Dickstein who was with Landau in Be'eri showed USA TODAY photographs that further corroborated his grisly accounts of the murdered Israelis. And last week, USA TODAY visited an Israel Defense Forces base on the outskirts of Jerusalem where a rabbinate unit of Israel's military has been working to identify the remains of victims, including women, children and infants after ZAKA volunteers delivered them there from communities in Israel's south.
Hamas attacks:How Israeli police are trying to find the gunmen
On the grounds of the base were a series of refrigerated trucks and shipping containers. Inside were dozens of filled body bags of various sizes − some very small.
Palestinian Muslims and Christians, like Jews, believe that the the body of the deceased should be buried as quickly as possible, ideally within 24 hours of death.
The bereaved family typically hosts a meal and opens their home for three days for guests to visit and share their condolences. Unsweetened bitter coffee is served.
Friends and family recount the life and qualities of the person deceased.
In Gaza, there is now little capacity to observe these rituals.
After Jadallah drove his father's body to a private burial site, for example, he went straight back to work, he said in a brief interview Thursday. One of the first photos he took was of a paramedic performing CPR on a wounded man. Jadallah's Instagram feed is filled with increasingly apocalyptic images of bombed out and smoldering homes, mosques, schools and even hospitals.
At least 16 Palestinian journalists have been killed since Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, a non-governmental professional organization.
"Who kills babies, who kills babies − free world, where are you?" a doctor at the European Gaza Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, pleaded Thursday in a video circulated by health officials and journalists in Gaza.
He stood in front of a medical stretcher on which lay six precious bundles. Bloodied, bandaged and lifeless, their tiny bodies were covered in a fine gray dust from the exploded concrete and brick that killed them.
Still, while the corpses in Gaza are piling up, it's too dangerous to hold funerals and the Palestinian enclave on the Mediterranean Sea is now running out of body bags, according to the United Nations.
Riham Al Qeeq, 40, a mother of four, said that her cousin was buried in a mass grave after after a deadly blast at the crowded Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday.
She said she wasn't able to participate in a brief ceremony at the site marking the deaths because she was worried about the safety of her family and had decided to flee south, close to Gaza's border with Egypt.
The increasing number of dead also means that people are having to bury their loved ones in ad hoc burial sites, according to Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the director general of Al-Shifa hospital there.
Abu Salmiya spoke to USA TODAY briefly on Thursday as he sought to juggle the round-the-clock needs of patients, a hospital facing critical shortages − medicine and clean drinking water among them − and a desire to keep the world informed about the scale of humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Communication into and out of Gaza is also exceptionally difficult because of diminishing electricity and virtually no internet access.
Abu Salmiya said that after the Al-Ahli hospital bombing, his medical facility, a few miles away, received "hundreds of bodies" that "were burned and mutilated and couldn’t be identified" while others were in critical-to-very-critical condition.
Thirty people, he said, were operated on without any anesthetic.
"For those that were killed we had to make a quick decision," he added.
"We had to bury them in mass graves so we don't face the spread of disease and also because they were either unidentified bodies or had no one to come and collect them."

A Nashville doctor cannot rent his home in a lake resort community on sites like Airbnb or Vrbo, the Tennessee Supreme Court has ruled, even as it delivered a potential win for short-term vacation rentals in communities where homeowners associations limit properties to "residential" uses.
Citing dozens of cases in other states and picking apart the grammar of a single phrase in the governing documents of Four Seasons, a development on Center Hill Lake in DeKalb County, the court ruled unanimously that the homeowners association rules were too ambiguous to prohibit short-term vacation rentals such as Airbnb or Vrbo.

FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. – Desmond Ridder was the picture of NFL growing pains as he talked about turning the page on a disastrous ending last weekend while, well, looking ahead to a chance to make a claim on first place.
Ridder, the green Atlanta Falcons quarterback, is coming off the first three-interception game of his young NFL career. That left a lot of explaining for his media session before Wednesday’s practice.
"You try to obviously learn from the mistakes that were made … but you don’t dwell on those interceptions," said Ridder, whose next chance to make amends comes on Sunday at Tampa Bay (3-2) in a matchup that will determine the lead in the NFC South.
Survive long enough as an NFL quarterback and there will be weeks like this. Heat like this, with hot-take analysts suggesting the quarterback take a seat on the bench. The Falcons (3-3) lost an eight-point game against Washington after two of their final three drives ended with picks by the second-year quarterback. The other possession was rather ugly, too; the ball was turned over on downs that included a sack and two incompletions.
Talking turnovers, Ridder, 24, insisted there wasn’t a connecting thread. Was it accuracy or the play design? Bad decisions or bad routes?
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
"There were a couple things on each, where I could’ve made a better read, we could’ve ran a better route, or miscommunication," he said. "Or all three. So, there’s little parts in that entire game – not only with myself but with the whole offense. It’s got to be all 11 guys working on the same page."
In rolling with a young quarterback, the Falcons knew there would be some turbulence along the way with this learning curve. Ridder is surrounded by a strong cast of supporting weapons including first-round picks Bijan Robinson, Kyle Pitts and Drake London. And the defense has improved, allowing them to stay in games.
Yet as natural as it is for the quarterback to attract scrutiny, the crunch-time meltdown on Sunday – which included glaring clock management issues on top of the picks – wasn’t all on Ridder. Arthur Smith, the Falcons coach and play-caller, has fingerprints on this, too.
The Falcons’ operational process during the final minutes was a mess. On at least three occasions, the play-clock nearly ran out as Ridder prepared to call for the snaps. Atlanta probably uses as many personnel packages as any team in the league, which can help create matchup advantages but also requires frequent substitutions. And the unit uses an extensive amount of pre-snap motion, which can also chew up time.
In any event, this stuck out as the issues piled up on Sunday. During one sequence, the flow was so sloppy that after Ridder spiked the football to kill the clock, the Falcons still had to use a timeout as the 25-second play-clock was about to expire.
Asked about the operational issues, Smith fired back with arithmetic.
"Two-thousand plays the last two years," Smith said. "Things happen. They are all different. I wouldn’t call that some catastrophic trend. Now they shouldn’t happen. But they’re all different, why they happened. You identify the problem. But you take three plays out of 2,360…"
But still. It’s what happened lately. The mishaps on Sunday came with the game on the line.
"We can play this game all day," defended Smith, in his third season at the helm. "What about Houston? What about New York?"
In Week 5, the Falcons used a 10-play, 56-yard drive to beat the Texans 21-19 with a Younghoe Koo field goal as time expired. In Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, they executed a 12-play, 66-yard drive for Koo’s game-winning field goal with just under a minute on the clock. The New York game referenced was Smith’s first victory as Falcons coach, in Week 3 in 2021, when his team beat the Giants as then-quarterback Matt Ryan directed a seven-play, 56-yard drive that culminated with a Koo field goal as time expired.
"We’ve won a lot of games handling those situations," Smith added. "Obviously, we didn’t do it last week. We’ve got to get it fixed. This isn’t a trend, a runaway story. Acknowledge what happened. Fix it…Those things happened. That’s not the only reason we lost the game."
Smith pointed to the turnovers, maintaining that NFL teams this season have won just 6% of the games when committing three turnovers.
"Go back to Houston, and those guys executed pretty damn good," Smith said.
Ridder didn’t dispute the mishaps with the operational flow, which typically include the process of getting the play-call from the sideline in addition to the substitutions. He summed it up as a matter of paying better attention to detail, yet he also acknowledged the challenges with communication….especially as the play-clock winds down.
"It makes you speed things up faster," Ridder said. "That’s something we don’t want to do. It goes back to communication. Everybody knowing where they’re supposed to be…just the details with those plays."
Two of Ridder’s teammates, Pitts and London, commended their quarterback for keeping a calm demeanor amid the late-game chaos.
"He’s even-keeled," Pitts said. "When stuff is getting out of control, that’s not when you want to crumble. He’s good at keeping his composure."
Now Ridder – and the rest of his unit – will have to prove capable of growing from the hard lessons.
It's possible the NFL has never looked cooler.
That was perfectly evident Sunday, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers became the most recent team to throw it back, breaking out their beloved – beloved? – "Creamsicle" uniforms for the first time since 2012. (The NFC South-leading Bucs even got into the spirit of the occasion, capsizing in a 20-6 loss to the Lions – very reminiscent of their feckless performances during a two-decade run in "Florida Orange" from 1976-96.)
But that throwback comeback will hardly be the last – and if you don’t already know what’s coming in Weeks 7 and 8, you’ll be thrilled to see other classic uniforms coming out of mothballs. Even better, some fresh fashion-forward alternates are also coming down the pike.
Naturally, not every team is successfully leveraging the new opportunities the league has afforded with the use of secondary helmets and alternate and/or retro color schemes. So let’s take this haberdashery interlude to do a deep dive on NFL couture and rank the alternate uniforms from best to worst:
Sunday night, y’all – Kelly Green (with silver pants and helmet wings) is finally back after Nike finally dialed in the color fabrication. The “Midnight Green” scheme that’s been synonymous with Jeffrey Lurie’s ownership is underappreciated, not to mention championship-certified. But Kelly should always be an option in Philly’s palette, and its 13-year absence has been far too lengthy. (And a nice unintended consequence? Using the Kelly helmets twice this season precludes the return of last year’s alternate black tops.)
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
So nice to see “Bucco Bruce” return after an 11-year hiatus. And it seems retro is here to stay – at least intermittently – moving forward, the Bucs claiming on their website: “Creamsicle is a link between past and present. Of heroes come and gone. On this bridge between eras, it’s up to all of us to pass the torch. This is not a throwback. It’s our heart and soul. The core of who we are.” Maybe that’s a bit much for a team that was so abjectly bad during their inaugural Creamsicle phase, but pretty cool the Buccaneers have embraced their history – and the two post-Bucco Lombardi Trophies have surely helped. And that leads to another point: Tampa’s new-ish all-pewter alternates are perhaps the most underrated uniform of the Color Rush ilk.
Tampa Bay's expansion brethren from 1976 will also be turning back the clock to their original silver, blue and green look – complete with the less-caffeinated Seahawk – in Week 8. Not since 2001, before the ‘Hawks moved into their current stadium, have we seen the unis made famous by Steve Largent, Cortez Kennedy, Kenny Easley and Curt Warner. It’s a very nice offset to the attention-grabbing highlighter-green alternates.
“Old gold,” black and white looks good in virtually any combination – aside from those regrettable gold jerseys they tried in 2002 – whether in a callback to the team’s earliest looks from the 1960s or the monochrome white or black combos utilized in the current era. But the Saints really hit a home run with the alternate black helmet introduced last year, one that featured their iconic fleur-de-lis logo in gold on the side with a stream of smaller ones in a tapering pattern down the center line – similar to the feathers used by the Seahawks.
They’re now 3-0 in the “White Bengal” presentation – which finally includes a white helmet – after it debuted last year and returned in Week 3 against the Rams. Spectacular. It will resurface for Week 13’s Monday nighter against Jacksonville, too … though not before we have to endure the return of the team’s additional orange jersey.
The white “Pat Patriot” helmet and its throwback kit – a callback to AFL royalty – blessedly reappeared last year, just in time to spruce up a team that’s gone with a pretty basic look … to include the basic product Bill Belichick and Co. are currently putting on the field.
The next time we seem them on the field – Week 8, following their bye – they won’t quite be evoking AFL royalty … but only because their famously glorious, “Luv Ya Blue” Houston Oilers look with the white helmet and Columbia Blue oil derrick didn’t come into existence until 1975 and was last featured by the Tennessee Oilers in 1998. But the Titans have finally gone back to their roots and will even be shoving it in the faces of their H-Town replacements, the Texans, in Week 15. "It's been a long time coming," said Hall of Fame Oilers QB Warren Moon, who also hopes the Titans will get to wear the jerseys in Houston someday in appreciation of those fans.
They finally came to their senses and brought back their slick J-E-T-S logo from the 1980s in the “Legacy White” package they’ve already used to honor the “New York Sack Exchange” twice this season – including opening night. You remember, when new QB Aaron Rodgers got the win in his glorious NYJ debut. Moving forward, boys, let’s continue catching up to the Giants by also adding a home green jersey to pair with the flashback Boeing-esque sigil. After that, let’s maybe consider an entirely radical logo – which actually incorporates the silhouette of a jet fighter – and slap that on your crowns while scrapping the dopey Stealth Black helmet introduced in 2022.
When it comes to the extra uniform – forgettable throwbacks or gray Color Rush – they’ve done alternate in pretty much the most forgettable ways. Until now. Make sure you see Week 8’s Monday night game at Ford Field, when the Lions will break out their new metallic “Honolulu Blue” helmets featuring their 1960s alternate logo plus two stripes – the display effectively a nice co-brand with Ford’s famous Mustang, another icon from the ‘60s. Very cool way to commemorate what’s already becoming a memorable season between the lines for the NFC North leaders, not to mention the franchise’s 90th year as the Lions.
You could argue – and I have – no club has better unis. Not only that, since moving back to LA and updating their closets in 2020, they’ve given themselves so many mix-and-match scenarios, in addition to the royal blue and navy (with corresponding helmet lightning bolt) Color Rush options. But as much as folks used to pine for their Powder Blue alternates – which have lost just a little luster in the current iteration – now it’d be nice if the Bolts could either bring back the royal helmet with sunshine-y lightning used in the Air Coryell days, or the navy buckets with white bolts rocked by Junior Seau, LaDainian Tomlinson and so many others. (For the record, love the navy and white.)
Let’s commend them for maximizing the use – three appearances this season – of the retro red helmets and original logo with the black, white and gold striping mix meant to honor both the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech. Wouldn’t mind occasionally seeing the classic falcon on the black helmets as a callback to the Deion Sanders days, but that can wait. At least we won’t be subject to those vile gradient alternate jerseys in 2023.
Little reason to mess with something that’s practically perfect, but their deviations work well. The “Steel Curtain” era throwbacks won’t pop off the screen, but the 1970s number font style is the giveaway. Pittsburgh’s all-black Dark Knight look is among the best alternates going – especially when you consider the mistake it would be to revive some of the club’s awful appearances from yesteryear, bumblebees, shoulder swatches and whatnot.
Sunday afternoon, they’re going to roll out their new “Indiana Nights” one-off for 2023. Couple of thoughts here. They’ve added black helmets because Indy fans allegedly demanded them, and they play into the nocturnal theme – fine … aside from the fact the Colts have zero prime-time games this year. Otherwise, this is fairly boss. The secondary logo – with the state of Indiana serving as the center of the “C” for Colts on the shoulder is a plus. But the “heather pattern” used for the blue-on-blue uniform – golfers will recognize it immediately – really distinguishes this get-up.
Never too far afield, their alternates provide truly nice subtleties. They reverted to the “Purple People Eaters” days while rocking "The Vikings Classic” in Week 1. And keep your eyes peeled for the perfectly pleasing and pristine purple-and-gold alternates.
It’s not quite as slick as the retro Jets, but Sunday night marked this season’s first usage of the block GIANTS logo – with the white Color Rush road treatment – Big Blue used for the final quarter of the 20th century. It will return twice more in 2023, both at home when the Giants can also sport their Lawrence Taylor-Bill Parcells era blue jerseys.
A shame they’re not donning their old-school look this week, perfectly timed to the 1972 team popping champagne as the last unbeatens (49ers, Eagles) of the 2023 season suffered their first setbacks. But the Fins will be kitted in their original unis in Week 8 and again in Week 16. (In the future, perhaps let’s consider a new dome with a watery, shimmery look for the aquatic mammals? Maybe?)
They’ll continue wearing the duds – with shaded jersey numbers – the 1994 Super Bowl champions made famous, sporting the red version twice this season and the white roadies once.
Their 2020 rebrand has aged fairly well so far – doesn’t hurt when you win the Super Bowl in your new threads. It’s also helped that they’ve deemphasized the “bone” jerseys and pants originally intended as their roadies to a more seldom-utilized alternative.
Let’s issue belated credit for this season’s very clean uniform reboot, the whites (with a new dash of silver) especially evocative of their long-gone days in St. Louis. The alternate all-blacks, plus helmet, that debuted in Week 5 still seem extraneous. But, fine, whatever. Cardinals can only be so badass.
Their latest rebrand has gone so well … that new ownership is already mulling yet another one. But the alternate black uniforms topped with the black lids are the least-objectionable aspect – the usage of the D.C. flag on the right shoulder (in burgundy and gold) and back of the helmet the deftest touch.
They're one of several old-school organizations that’s never embraced hindsight or foresight flair especially well. The green jerseys with gold numbers paired with green pants in recent years have been a marked step forward … but another could be taken with a fresh second helmet to top it off.
Never been a huge fan of their 1960s-era throwbacks, whether home or away – and they’ll sport both this season. In Monday night’s win, they topped it with their alternate white-shelled helmet adorned with the current star insignia. Meh.
They added a black helmet to the wardrobe last year and have evidently decided it would look better atop their “Panther Blue” jerseys than as part of a monochrome blackout. Low bar, but agreed … not that it’s likely to help them win a game.
What is it with 1995 feline expansion teams? Thankfully, the Jags are finding their way back from the black-and-gold, two-toned wilderness. But nothing inspiring, or especially objectionable, in their black and (mostly) teal look at present.
They’ve got multiple ways to mix and match their various (dark) colors, the best alternate the purple on purple with gold jersey numbers. The original logo Baltimore used from 1996 to ’98 was one of the busier ones in NFL history … and might be fun to break out periodically for nostalgic purposes – especially if we could see those ugly black pants with the fat white stripe from the days of Ravens yore.
The NFL’s youngest franchise is also the only one to never change its crest. Tradition – yay. But last year, the Texans really stepped out by adding a metallic “Battle Red” helmet to go with the alternate jerseys branded the same way. Yaaawn.
This ranking is more a penalty that they’re not doing more than interspersing the alternate red jersey and pants. Let’s mix that grazing bison from the AFL days into heavier rotation and work up another lid – meaning something more imaginative than just taking the red shells from the 1990s Super Bowl teams out of mothballs.
For years, pretty much everything they’ve touched has turned to horse scat. Extend that to their attempt at merging their history with an edgy look. This year’s “snowcapped” (read: white) helmets adorned with the Orange Crush and Elway-era D logo might have worked … if the Broncos had been able to wear all white instead of Color Rush orange. It just wound up looking like a … melted creamsicle? It returns in Week 16 if you were fortunate enough to miss it the first time.
Let’s acknowledge there isn't much to do historically for a franchise that opted for a hideous color scheme and no primary logo. And rolling out a “retro” white helmet based on a leather model from the 1950s … is something – though perhaps preferable to slapping the Keebler Elf on there, something only Ja’Marr Chase would fancy. While on some level we appreciate the Browns’ decades-long holdout on helmet symbology, couldn’t we bend that rule in the alternate space? Especially after the wicked subsidary logo they unveiled earlier this year with the input of fan votes?
A shame a franchise so steeped in a century-plus’ worth of tradition – which also means it probably shouldn’t be looking especially chic – looks like such jack… Sorry, looks like such jack-o'-lanterns in their orange jerseys and new orange helmets. Stick with the winged University of Michigan knockoffs – yes, the Bears briefly wore them first in the 1930s – and call it a day. Better yet, let’s wind back to the 1960s and occasionally re-adopt the white version of the familiar “C” logo and truly honor the late Dick Butkus and Gale Sayers.
In my most recent overarching uniform power rankings, their iconic look ranked No. 1. And, as expressed elsewhere, it’s sometimes foolish to mess with magnificence. But the Silver and Black are being ranked last here mostly to put them on notice while serving a complacency penalty. The white Color Rush and white throwback jersey (with silver numbers) they’ve utilized in recent years are totally ... fine. But there’s a real opportunity to take their sinister look to a new, Darth Vader-caliber level a few times a year. Black pants? Black helmets with a chrome Raiders shield? Seriously, Mark Davis, what are we waiting for here? Commit to uniform excellence!
Pulling on the red pants is as frisky as they get, so no alternates or throwbacks to assess. And a team based in K.C. has little reason to dust off its long-ago Dallas Texans roots. As far as anything in the pipeline? “I think we have a very distinct brand with the red and white, and I don’t anticipate steering away from that any time soon,” owner Clark Hunt revealed this year, saying he also wanted to honor the wishes of his later father – AFL and team founder Lamar Hunt – who wanted uniform continuity. Welp, it wins.

Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson will indeed undergo shoulder surgery that will end his rookie season after just four games. Team owner Jim Irsay made the announcement Wednesday.
The news doesn't come as a surprise after Irsay told ESPN on Monday that Richardson would "probably" miss the rest of the regular season, with surgery possible in the next week or so. Richardson suffered a reported Grade 3 AC joint sprain in his shoulder during a Week 5 win over the Tennessee Titans and was placed on injured reserve last week.
The No. 4 overall pick in April's NFL draft missed two games and left two others early as the Colts have gotten off to a 3-3 start.
"After consultation with our medical staff, Anthony, and those close to him, it has been determined that he will undergo surgery to repair his injured shoulder, which will end his season," Irsay said in a statement. "Anthony is a competitor, and we know how difficult and disappointing this is for him and our team.
"We collected several medical opinions and we felt this was the best course of action for his long-term health. We anticipate a full recovery and there is no doubt Anthony has a promising future."

In the meantime, veteran Gardner Minshew has taken over at quarterback. He threw for 329 yards on Sunday against Jacksonville, but committed four turnovers in a 37-20 loss. Third-year quarterback Sam Ehlinger, who started three games in 2022, becomes Minshew’s backup, and the Colts also have former Vikings third-rounder Kellen Mond on the practice squad.

EXETER, N.H. — Many candidates in the Republican presidential field are calling for a new generation of leaders in Washington. Former Vice President Mike Pence isn’t one of them.  
“It’s not a time for on-the-job training,” he told a crowd of New Hampshire voters at a town hall sponsored by the USA TODAY Network last week, repeating an argument he’s made time and again on the 2024 campaign trail.
“I’m running for president because, and I do say this with all humility, I’m the most qualified, tested and ready conservative seeking the Republican nomination”  
Pence has pitched a more traditional brand of conservatism than other candidates in the race that's focused on Republican values, fiscal responsibility and a strong U.S. military presence. Once deputy to former President Donald Trump, Pence also has offered strong rebukes of his ex-running mate's populist style, arguing it is "unmoored to conservative principles.”
But that argument doesn’t appear to be resonating with voters in the Granite State, or across the country. A recent Suffolk University survey, conducted in partnership with The Boston Globe and USA TODAY, showed Pence at just 1% in New Hampshire.
At the national level, Pence is doing slightly better. A Morning Consult survey on the race, fielded between Oct. 13 and 15, showed Pence at 6% – over 40 points behind Trump. He's also trailing GOP contenders like former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.
So, how is Pence attempting to win over voters? Here’s a look at the priorities he outlined in New Hampshire that would impact Americans coast to coast if the former vice president is elected to the White House.  
When it comes to balancing the federal budget and reducing the national debt, Pence has called for reforming mandatory spending programs like Social Security and Medicare – at least for some Americans.  
“I’d say to everybody that’s got hair the same color as me, this doesn’t affect you ... we’re not going to make changes to the deal,” the one-time talk radio host told voters in New Hampshire. 
For Americans under age 40, however, Pence said he would opt to privatize Social Security by allowing young workers to invest their payroll taxes into savings accounts. He insisted that the plan would give American workers twice what they earn from Social Security.  
The idea has been floated before by members of the Republican Party, most prominently during former President George W. Bush's administration. But it has never garnered enough support in Congress to become a reality for Americans.  
As the war between Israel and Hamas rages on, Pence in New Hampshire pledged to unequivocally support Israel, calling the country “our most cherished ally.” 
“We’ll make it clear to Hezbollah and Lebanon, to Iran and any other powers in the region, that everybody needs to stand down,” Pence said. “We’re going to defend Israel.”  
During the Trump administration, Pence helped negotiate the Abraham Accords, a bilateral agreement signed by Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in 2020 to normalize relations. However, at the town hall, Pence noted that facilitating further peace talks likely wouldn’t be a priority under his administration, given the ongoing war.  
“It feels to me like real progress is going to have to take a second chair to Israel doing what it needs to do,” he said.  
Pence offered similarly strong words on other issues of U.S. national security, including ongoing efforts to bolster Ukraine in its war against Russia.
When asked about his views on allocating U.S. taxpayer dollars to aid foreign conflicts, he argued that it’s among the most powerful ways America can stave off future aggression by countries like China.  
“China has made no secret of the fact that they would like to grab Taiwan,” Pence said. The Chinese government views the East Asian island as an extension of its territory and in recent years has ramped up military activity around its shores.  
Describing the growing superpower as “the greatest economic and strategic threat facing the U.S.,” Pence told New Hampshire voters that, as president, he would push to implement tariffs on Chinese goods and expand U.S. military presence in the South China Sea to defend American interests in the region. 
“The way we deal with China is not by diminishing our commitment to the Asia-Pacific. It’s by increasing our commitment,” Pence argued. A strong defense strategy would pave the way toward “a peaceful future with China and progress for the Chinese people,” he said.  
CONCORD, N.H.−It’s a “really bad day” for former President Donald Trump, according to GOP presidential hopeful Chris Christie.  
That’s because Sidney Powell, Trump’s former attorney, pled guilty Thursday to six misdemeanor charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia.
Under the terms of the agreement, Powell will serve a six-year probation, pay a fine of $6,000 and testify at the trials of several co-defendants in the case. She also agreed to write an apology letter to Georgia residents.  
“The interesting part of that plea is that she will be testifying against Mark Meadows, against Rudy Giuliani, against Donald Trump,” Christie told reporters shortly after filling to put his name on the ballot in New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary. “You don't give a no-jail plea deal unless that person's got something very good to say that will help your case against the others.” 
Powell was among 19 defendants named in Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis’ Georgia election interference case, which also included Trump.  
“I did this for seven years in the fifth largest office in the country," said Christie, who served as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey from January 2002 to December 2008. "You don't give a no-jail plea deal unless that person's got something very good to say that will help your case against the others."
Hi OnPolitics readers! Even if things feel uncertain in Washington right now, there are still some traditions that remain on the campaign trail: holding babies, attending state fairs and going to New Hampshire.  
A civic pilgrimage: The crowded field of 2024 Republican White House hopefuls are chatting with people at diners, coffee shops and bookstores. Some are trekking to the state capital in Concord to sign their name at a historic desk to be on the ballot, while others are sharing their messages through several town halls and other stops.
‘Weed themselves out’: But voters aren’t necessarily welcoming this group of candidates, according to seven USA TODAY reporters who traveled to New Hampshire. Instead, these crucial voters are sending a clear message to Republican candidates: Some of you need to drop out.  
"It’s still early. There's still a lot on that stage," said Laura Williams, a registered Republican from Rochester, N.H., who plans to vote in the primary, told USA TODAY. "Let some weed themselves out, and those that rise to the top, you know, we’ll wait it out and see." 
While former President Donald Trump is still the clear frontrunner in the state, non-Trump voters told USA TODAY they are hoping one of the other Republicans can break through, but they're not sure it's possible. 
"You know, like, Chris Christie, I think his main goal is to get Trump out. I want to hear what else you're gonna do," Larry Provencher, a semi-retired artist in Exeter, N.H. said.

A Nashville doctor cannot rent his home in a lake resort community on sites like Airbnb or Vrbo, the Tennessee Supreme Court has ruled, even as it delivered a potential win for short-term vacation rentals in communities where homeowners associations limit properties to "residential" uses.
Citing dozens of cases in other states and picking apart the grammar of a single phrase in the governing documents of Four Seasons, a development on Center Hill Lake in DeKalb County, the court ruled unanimously that the homeowners association rules were too ambiguous to prohibit short-term vacation rentals such as Airbnb or Vrbo.
After 31 long years of waiting, a woman from New York has stepped forward to share with local lottery officials she was the person who never claimed $12 million from a 1991 Lotto jackpot.
Janet Valenti, age 77, revealed that she was the rightful owner of a $12 million New York Lotto jackpot that sat unclaimed for over 30 years.
One small mistake led to the unfortunate fate of the ticket, and there was nothing she could do to retrieve it.
Valenti claimed she had the winning lottery ticket worth $12 million sitting on an end table next to her couch, among other lottery tickets, according to the Lottery Post. She believed she had previously checked all the tickets on the table, so as she was preparing to leave her home with her two teenage children and mother to spend the weekend at a friend's house, she threw the tickets in the trash. That was back in July of 1991.
Over the weekend, she was unaware of her huge mistake. When she returned, a friend informed her of a winning $12 million Lotto ticket sold in Staten Island. Valenti discovered she had won after seeing the winning numbers in the paper.
Upon arriving home, she rushed to retrieve her ticket from the garbage, but could not find it.
"My next-door neighbor, who has never in her life, the whole time I lived there, ever put my garbage out for collection, she did," Valenti told the Lottery.
She couldn't go digging in the trash due to sanitation already picking up the garbage. It was over, Valenti was out that $12 million.
The woman from Staten Island attempted to contact lawyers but was informed that the only way to claim the prize was with a physical lottery ticket. Even obtaining surveillance footage from the retailer would be of no use.
"I was a wreck," Valenti recalled to the Lottery. "I was sick for a long time over it."
On July 17, 1992, the $12 million Lotto jackpot went unclaimed and was returned to the state lottery fund. This unclaimed prize holds the record for being the largest in New York's history.
Valenti was a single mother to her two teenage children, Kevin and Jennifer, at the time. Her husband, Bruno, had passed away in 1984. To cope with the incident, she turned to reading stories about "lottery curses", infamous stories of people whose lives took a turn for the worse after winning the Lottery. This helped her from losing her mind over the situation.
"Given that kind of money, things can go bad," Valenti told the Lottery. "That was a saving grace. Who knows what would have happened if I'd had that money? You read these stories, a lot of people win Lotto, they drop dead. Maybe it was [Bruno] looking out for us to not have that kind of money."
Despite her tremendous loss over 30 years ago, Valenti remains steadfast in her pursuit of playing the Lottery.
"The most I ever get is a free play or a couple of dollars," she said. "That's it."
Winner stories:Michigan lottery winners: Residents win $100,000 from Powerball and $2 million from scratch-off game
Someone won $12 million in Lotto on July 17, 1991, with a ticket purchased for $1 at J.N.J. Delicatessen in Graniteville. Despite holding the winning numbers (2, 3, 6, 43, and 51) the winner never claimed the prize. Carolina Cutroneo, the store owner, asked customers if they had the ticket for a year following the win.
"I think somebody, when they saw they'd won, died or never found out in the first place," she had said at the time. "In the beginning, we were putting up signs every day, but no one came forward. It's probably somebody who really needs it."
According to New York Lottery spokesperson Bill Knowlton, the big prize winner could have been a visitor to the state or someone unfamiliar with playing the Lottery in New York. Knowlton also explained that some winners may wait to claim their prize because they are in the process of assembling an advisory team or they forget to do so.
According to Knowlton, one lottery winner waited three months to claim her prize because she was studying for her finals.
Tickets can be purchased in-person at gas stations, convenience stores and grocery stores. Some airport terminals may also sell lottery tickets.

A trendy Barcelona bar decorated in pastel pink and green hues has been named the world’s best bar of 2023. 
Sips, located in the heart of Barcelona’s L'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample district has not only earned the title of best in the world, but also best in Europe, according to this year’s The World’s 50 Best Bars list, an annual ranking of bars determined by the votes of 680 drinks experts from across the globe.
Don’t be fooled by the cozy interior, Sips can turn into a “a dark and sultry hideaway” as soon as the sun begins to set. Esencia, a bar inside the bar offers customers a wine tasting experience of sorts that breaks down the signature cocktails they offer in sips. 
There is the off chance that any one of their “wondrous creations” may be served in a metal cast of two hands, or a glass, depending on how colorful the cocktail, of course. 
This is the second year in a row that a Barcelona bar has taken possession of the top spot. 
"When we started Sips, we strongly believed that the bar was a beacon name itself. The drinks, music and the architecture of the bar itself are like 'little drops that fill the glass,' creating an experience that is unique to Sips,” Marc Álvarez, co-founder of Sips shared with CNBC.
Honorees from 28 different cities around the world were recognized at a live awards ceremony in Singapore on Tuesday, marking the first time the ceremony has been held in Asia.

The U.S. tied with England for most bars on the list, with a total of five U.S.-based bars included. Three of the bars named are in New York City. Café La Trova in Miami came in 24th place, while New Orleans bar Jewel of the South ranked 49 out of 50. 
Mexico City follows the U.S. and London closely, with four bars making the list. Argentina and Singapore were the countries with the third most number of winning bars with three wins each. 
Other special awards include the Roku Industry Icon awarded to Renato "Tato" Giovannoni of Florería Atlántico in Buenos Aires and The Ketel One Sustainable Bar Award bestowed upon Röda Huset in Stockholm, among many other awards presented that night.

For some, giving gifts is a way to show how well you know the birthday honoree. If you, your friend or loved one is born in November, you'll want to know each of its symbols if you want to give the perfect November birthday gift.
People born in November can have one of two astrological signs: Scorpio (born between November 1 and 21) or Sagittarius (born between November 22 and 30). The chrysanthemum also represents those born in November. 
But what about November's birthstone? Each month has at least one gemstone. Here's what you need to know about November's birthstones, including their colors, symbolism and more. 
Topaz and citrine are the two birthstones for November.
Topaz comes in an array of colors, such as blue, yellow, orange, pink, violet, red and brown.
The name is believed to derive from the Sanskrit word "tapas," meaning "fire", according to the Geological Institute of America, which is fitting since one of the gem's best known forms is yellow. Others, however, believe topaz gets its name from the Greek word "topazos", states the International Gem Society. Another popular topaz variety is blue.
Topaz is mostly mined in Brazil and northwestern Pakistan, states GIA. Other countries that mine topaz include Namibia, Nigeria, Madagascar, Mexico, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and the U.S.
Historically, pink-orange topaz was popular among royalty. This is no surprise since the stone is often referred to as "Imperial topaz." The nickname is said to originate from the Russian royal family's usage of the stone, according to GIA. Another justification is thanks to Brazilian Emperor Pedro II being gifted the gem in 1881.
This birthstone is believed to symbolize wealth and health. The ancient Greeks thought topaz brought strength. For centuries in India, wearing topaz above your heart meant a long life, beauty and intelligence. Yellow topaz, in particular, is said to attract wealth since its color "represents the riches of gold", according to IGS.
Besides being the birthstone for November, blue topaz is given for the fourth wedding anniversary, while Imperial topaz is for the twenty-third wedding anniversary.
Citrine is a type quartz, with its colors ranging from yellow to brown-orange. Its name originates from the French word "citron," meaning "lemon," states IGS.
Most citrine comes from the heat treatment of amethyst, according to GIA. The gem can be found in Bolivia, Spain, Madagascar, Mexico and Uruguay.
As for its history, citrine dates back to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The Greeks made ornaments from the stone, while Roman pontiffs wore rings made of citrine and amethyst, states GIA. Additionally, Scottish jewelry from the Victorian era often utilized citrine.
The stone is associated with happiness and joy, according to IGS. It is seen as a "success stone" and is said to bring prosperity. Citrine is also believed to affect the wearer's mood and calm them, states GIA.
Citrine is given as a gift for the thirteenth wedding anniversary.

USA TODAY is exploring the questions you and others ask every day.

Head to our Just Curious section to see what else we can answer for you.
There’s no contest: people love condiments. From ketchup, to mayo to mustard, condiments are a way to enhance flavors and textures that make an already great dish even better. We love to spread our favorite condiments on sandwiches, hot dogs, burgers and even pizza. (By now you’re either enraged or nodding along.) 
Diets have often demonized condiments because they can add calories, sugar and fat to a dish. But we want to hone in on one condiment in particular – mustard. Should mustard be lumped in with all condiments or does mustard offer unique benefits? We spoke with Lon Ben-Asher, MS, RD, LD/N, Registered Nutritionist and educator at Pritikin Longevity Center to find out everything you need to know about mustard. 
First, it’s worth mentioning that there are many different types of mustard. When you think of mustard, you most likely think of yellow mustard – the traditional bright yellow smooth paste that’s commonly zig-zagged on top of hot dogs and sandwiches. Other less common types of mustard include spicy mustard, dijon mustard and honey mustard. 
Yellow mustard, spicy mustard and dijon mustard all have very similar nutritional profiles. They are low in calories, sugar and fat, which makes them an excellent addition to a dish, especially if the goal is weight management. Ben-Asher explains, “Mustard can be utilized as a condiment which is low in calories and can help with weight management/control by enhancing flavor as an alternative to many high-calorie sauces, marinades and dressings.” 
Honey mustard, on the other hand, is a little bit different. Although its flavor balances sweetness with acidity in a harmonic way, it does add a little bit more calories, fat and sugar to your meal. One serving (1 tbsp) of yellow mustard, for example, has 9.2 calories, and negligible fat and sugar. One serving (1 tbsp) of honey mustard contains 69.5 calories, 6 grams of fat, and 2.4 grams of sugar. These statistics do not make honey mustard off limits, it’s just something you need to be mindful of. 
It turns out that mustard is packed with helpful nutrients. Ben-Asher says, “Mustard provides nutritional value as well by its mineral composition of selenium and magnesium, which are important for many systemic functions.” 
The powerful potential of mustard:How to use the condiment as an ingredient instead
According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, selenium is a trace mineral that is vital for the creation of various enzymes and proteins that help make DNA and protect cells from damage. Additionally, the NIH explains that magnesium is important for muscle and nerve function, regulation of blood sugar levels and blood pressure, and even the creation of DNA. 
Like many nutritious foods, mustard contains antioxidants. Ben-Asher adds, “In addition, mustard seeds contain antioxidant compounds called glucosinolates, which help protect cells from oxidative stress.” 
There’s some information floating around in the internet that says mustard is good for your liver. Turns out, this information is true. 
Ben-Asher explains, “Mustard can offer benefits to the liver in several ways.  It contains some compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties which can be beneficial for liver health. The mustard seeds contain omega-3 fatty acids, which can reduce inflammation and support liver function.  Mustard seeds can also support the liver’s detoxification processes and aid in eliminating toxins and other substances from the body.” 
We’ve learned that most types of mustard are low in calories, fat and sugar, so it seems to be like one of those foods we can enjoy. However, Ben-Asher says that there are still a few precautions, “It is considered safe to consume mustard daily and can be part of a healthy dietary pattern. It can be utilized as a low-calorie condiment to add flavor to foods without having a considerable impact on daily caloric intake. However, it’s important to consider for some individuals that intake may need to be limited or avoided. Although rare, mustard allergies can occur and if any adverse reactions are experienced – it should not be consumed.  Also, if someone has hypertension or other cardiovascular issues, many prepared mustards are high in sodium, therefore you may want to choose a no-salt-added or low-sodium version.”

Taking supplements can be scary, especially when you don’t really know what is inside.
Melatonin is no different, especially because it is regulated as a dietary supplement, which is given considerably less oversight than medications, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NIH). 
In fact, some melatonin supplements may not reflect the label accurately, according to the NIH. A study in 2017 tested different melatonin supplements and found that the amount of melatonin in the product did not match what on the product label. 
So, is melatonin safe? Here are your unanswered questions, answered. 
Generally, yes. 
Melatonin is a natural hormone that your body produces to help regulate the sleep/wake cycle, according to Dr. Hal Alpert, telemedicine consultant for Blue Sleep.
Melatonin levels are highest at the age of three, and they steadily decrease with age. For example, a 70-year-old will have about 25% of the melatonin level that a teenager has, according to Alpert. 
That being said, if a person's natural melatonin levels are not very high, the supplement can assist them to fall asleep quicker at the beginning of the night, said Alpert. 
“There's always been this potential concern that if we're replacing something that's naturally occurring or using something that's naturally occurring, will our bodies stop producing the naturally occurring substance?” said  Dr. Michelle Drerup, Director of Behavioral Sleep Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. “There's no evidence that supports that.”
However, just like every supplement, there are some side effects that can be caused by melatonin.

While it is rare to have any side effects from the popular supplement, it is possible.
Risks are involved with higher dosages, said Alpert. It is best to start lower and go higher if needed, with 10 milligrams being the maximum safe amount. 
These are some of the side effects to be aware of, according to Alpert:
Melatonin can also interfere with other drugs, so it is important to talk to your physician about the medication you are on and the safety of using melatonin as well, said Alpert.

Did you know that roughly 1 in 3 adults have insomnia? According to the Cleveland Clinic, 10% of adults fit the criteria for an insomnia disorder. 
Many people who suffer from insomnia and sleep disorders turn to supplements like melatonin to help them fall asleep faster, but does it work?
Find out how long melatonin lasts in your system, how long it takes to work and how much melatonin you should take for the best night's sleep. 
“The half-life of melatonin is between 20 and 50 minutes, so that means half of the initial dosage is eliminated after that amount of time,” explained Dr. Michelle Drerup, Director of Behavioral Sleep Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. “So, it would stay in your system around four to five hours.”
Melatonin does not do much for the body in terms of helping people stay asleep, if any effect occurs it has to do with initially falling asleep, said Drerup.
Is melatonin safe?:What to know about the supplement
Melatonin should be taken about two to four hours before your desired sleeping time, said Dr. Hal Alpert, a telemedicine consultant at Blue Sleep. Additionally, it is best not to drive for at least five hours after taking melatonin due to its lasting sedative effects.
“[Melatonin] is a hormone that signals that it's time to go to sleep and light exposure, particularly blue light from computers, cell phones, and fluorescent lights will inhibit the release of melatonin,” explained Alpert. “That is why for people who have insomnia it is best not to use these devices for at least four hours or so before bedtime.”
A starting dose of melatonin can be as low as .1 to .3 milligrams and the usual over-the-counter dosage is one to three milligrams in adults, said Alpert.
“The maximum safe dose is up to 10 milligrams, but it's shown that once you get to three milligrams, the higher doses don't get you to sleep any faster than the three-milligram dosage,” explained Alpert.

“People throw rocks at things that shine.” 
That lyric flashed through my head as I read a recent opinion column claiming that Taylor Swift “has yet to make a significant mark as a philanthropist,” and that her estimated $4 billion Eras Tour earnings are a chance for the singer to champion left-leaning causes in honor of her fans.
As Swifties know, though, this dismissive characterization of the 12-time Grammy Award winner’s charitable giving is anything but perfectly fine. Swift has a mind of her own, and she’s not afraid to use it. Her approach to philanthropy is no exception.
Map out Swift’s philanthropy and one finds the singer’s empathetic approach to giving is deeply personal and powerful, transcending political divides. That includes her support of friends, cancer patients, sexual assault survivors, disaster relief organizations and food banks along her Eras Tour. The list goes on. 
'Eras' movie shows women have options:In 'Eras Tour' movie, Taylor Swift shows women how to reject the mandate of one identity
Take her steady support of friends who have fallen on hard times. Swift, for example, loaned her New York City home to Sophie Turner amid the “Game of Thrones” star’s divorce from Joe Jonas and gifted Kesha $250,000 after a judge ruled against the singer in a civil court case.
What’s more, after Swift won a countersuit against former country music DJ David Mueller, who groped her during a red-carpet event in 2013, “The Man” singer pledged money to the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit that helps counsel sexual assault survivors.
Perhaps the most personal of Swift’s charitable giving, however, is her ongoing support of those fighting cancer, just as both of Swift’s parents have battled cancer – an experience Swift writes about in “Soon You’ll Get Better,” a deep track on her "Lover" album.
Rather than make splashy, polarizing donations to Planned Parenthood, as fellow artists Harry Styles and Lizzo have done, Swift speaks up about important policy concerns but stops short of big politicized left-leaning donations – perhaps out of respect for her more traditional fans.
Swift rose to fame as a country singer, securing the admiration of more moderate women who found escape in songs like “Love Story” and “Ours,” in which Swift sings about prioritizing love, marriage and the allusion of family life over a depressing 9-to-5 cubicle job.
Yet, since her transition to pop superstardom and amassing a global following, Swift has done a remarkable job of staying true to her progressive values without overly politicizing her brand. Her focus, instead, is on connecting with her fans – whether from a stage or a hospital room.
Republicans should fear Swifties:Taylor Swift has power to swing the presidential election. What if nothing else matters?
What’s more, it’s reasonable to assume that a singer savvy enough to question the legitimacy of FTX, a now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, has already mapped out her philanthropic goals.
In fact, Swift could already be donating to the left-leaning groups that some people want her to give to, but – for a variety of reasons – does so privately, which is her prerogative and part of her constitutional right to free speech.
Whatever direction Swift decides to tack with her charitable giving – now or in the future – her decision likely will be personally driven, intentional and an extension of her already significant mark on the world of philanthropy. And, most important, the decision will be entirely her own.

How do you protect innocent civilians while conducting effective urban military operations against an enemy who is integrated into the civilian population and entrenched in a location’s infrastructure? 
Israeli civilian and military decision-makers face this question anew after Hamas’ unprecedented attack from Gaza into southern Israel on Oct. 7. The explosion at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday that killed hundreds of people points up the dangers faced by civilians in an active war zone.
Israel’s initial answer to the question of how to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza was to tell more than a million Palestinian residents to flee their homes and head south. Barring an 11th-hour mass exodus from northern Gaza, Israel will face the possibility of further civilian casualties. 
Fighting urban battles amid civilian populations is certainly an issue U.S. decision-makers have grappled with during military operations over the two decades since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. And there are lessons about protecting civilians that Israel could take from America's recent experience.
Among them: Consider potential civilian losses when planning airstrikes, seek improved methods of collecting and deploying intelligence, and provide safe passage for civilians away from war zones.
So far, more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and nearly 4,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed in the latest conflict. Despite the ferocity of the Hamas attack and the Israeli response, the moral obligation to reduce civilian harm cannot be ignored.
Urban battles are not unusual occurrences in the Middle East. The U.S.-led battle against the Islamic State terrorist organization for Raqqa, Syria, in 2017 provides parallels to the Gaza conflict in terms of environment, adversary and humanitarian implications.
Our research on that ISIS conflict, conducted with an eye toward reducing civilian harm, suggests that military effectiveness can be retained while protecting civilians and reducing damage to civilian infrastructure.
Operating in densely populated urban environments is incredibly difficult even for experienced military units such as the Israel Defense Forces, which have operated in Gaza before. Hamas, not unlike ISIS, has a history of using civilian infrastructure as a defense against Israeli military operations.
Hamas invaded my brother's home.Now my family is held hostage in Gaza.
Organizations like ISIS and Hamas know their adversaries are committed to reducing civilian harm and take advantage of this adherence to international law and norms. Before the Battle of Raqqa, the coalition along with Syrian Defense Forces partners initially encircled the city to weaken ISIS fighters rather than allowing them to escape to the next stronghold. However, this also prevented the departure of civilian Raqqa residents.
In Syria, ISIS tactical facilities were often located near civilian infrastructure, requiring individual strike decisions to consider ways to minimize civilian harm. Such considerations could help reduce civilian casualties in Gaza as well, though civilian deaths and infrastructure damage can never be eliminated, even with precision weapons. In Raqqa, collateral damage to infrastructure made recovery and reconstruction operations difficult and time consuming.
Urban fighting in a location you do not control, especially when reliant upon air support, also makes it difficult to collect, verify and share real-time intelligence.
In Syria, intelligence efforts were hampered by civilians moving across Raqqa to escape bombardments, searching for shelter, food and new places to live. This also is now true in the Gaza Strip, one of the most densely populated geographies in the world. 
I've seen firsthand the oppression:I'm a Palestinian American. I almost gave up hope people will see the humanity in us.
An enhanced focus on the task of gathering and leveraging intelligence is critical, despite the many challenges facing the Israeli intelligence services in Gaza. An examination of U.S. intelligence shortcomings in Syria suggests the need for improved intelligence-specific tradecraft and training, enhanced efforts to gather and validate open-source information and improved civilian casualty assessments.
In Syria, the U.S.-led coalition acted on the advice of the Syrian Defense Forces and opened humanitarian corridors out of Raqqa as the battle lasted longer than expected. This was critical for evacuations of civilians and reducing civilian deaths.
While concerns persisted over the possibility of escaping ISIS fighters who could regroup in other locations, the corridors reduced the civilian injury and death toll in Raqqa and its environs.
Similar escape routes could save civilian lives in Gaza as well, though the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt is now damaged and closed, according to aid workers. This leaves residents of Gaza trapped and unable to escape the aerial bombardment from Israel.
Israel’s new demand that civilians flee applies to northern Gaza, but southern Gaza lacks the infrastructure to support the additional civilians, who would still remain trapped. 
The United States regularly encourages all partners to limit civilian harm during conflict, including in current hotspots such as Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s statements during his visit to Tel Aviv and Arab capitals, along with efforts to open the Rafah border crossing for humanitarian aid and evacuations, reminded the global community of the rules-based order and the criticality of shielding innocent civilians during conflict. 
One of the distinctions between the international community and organizations such as Hamas and ISIS is its commitment to reducing and limiting civilian harm during conflict. While extracting vengeance through an eye-for-eye approach may seem legitimate, even necessary, in the moment, listening to better angels could help reduce civilian harm in the long run.

As usual, it’s a great day to not be former president and current criminal defendant Donald J. Trump.
Sidney Powell – his former legal adviser, fellow champion of the gargantuan and ongoing “rigged election” lie and co-defendant in the sweeping Georgia election interference case – pleaded guilty Thursday and agreed to testify against others involved in the alleged conspiracy.
The word “others” is important, as it may well include Trump, the far-and-away leading GOP presidential primary candidate who, one imagines, is presently hurling all available ketchup at the walls of his Mar-a-Lago pout room.
Powell was known among Trump fanatics and election conspiracy theorists as the person who would “release the Kraken” and unleash unassailable evidence the election was rigged, righteously returning Trump to the White House. In a Nov. 24, 2020, Fox Business interview with Lou Dobbs, Powell said of the election, "There's no way there was anything but widespread election fraud here."
She has now pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference of election duties and been sentenced to six years of probation.
She also has to pay some fines and write an apology letter to the people of Georgia, which is quite the thing when you consider the unbridled conviction with which she lied to the American public, often via Fox News appearances, about the 2020 presidential election being “stolen” from Trump.
Trump's Georgia arrest isn't an anomaly:Take a good look at Trump's booking photo, Republicans. That's your GOP.
Powell's unhinged conspiracies were featured prominently in Dominion Voting Systems successful lawsuit against Fox News, and she's facing her own $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit from the company as well.
It appears the Kraken may not be all she was cracked up to be. Worse yet for the MAGA crowd, said Kraken will now be released in Trump’s direction.
Duly flipped, Powell will undoubtedly help Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ case against other defendants like former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and the former president himself, as she was central to much of the hysterical lying and scheming that transpired after Joe Biden won the presidency fair and square.
In a Nov. 14, 2020, tweet, Trump hailed Powell as part of his “truly great team” of lawyers.
Powell was part of an election conspiracy news conference held at the Republican National Committee headquarters on Nov. 19, 2020, an event made famous largely because Giuliani was sweating so profusely that hair dye ran down the side of his face.
At the news conference, Powell said: “What we are really dealing with here and uncovering more by the day is the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China and the interference with our elections here in the United States.”
People with even a pinky toe still dipped in the pool of reality knew at the time that was nonsense, but it's clear from her guilty plea that Powell knew it was nonsense as well.
She went to meet with Trump at the White House on Dec. 18, 2020, and talked about declaring a national emergency and having the president order the military to seize certain voting machines.
How long until Trump breaks gag order?Trump, who never shuts up, now has a gag order to whine about. And you know he will.
It’s easy to write Powell off as a conspiratorial crackpot, but they were all conspiratorial crackpots, and she marched side by side with Giuliani and Trump.
So the Kraken pleading guilty does three significant things:
For all her zany nonsense – which was featured over and over on Fox News in the wake of the 2020 election, helping brainwash a sizable swath of the populace – Powell was sane enough to know when to save her own hide.
Asked by the judge Thursday whether she believes “there are enough facts that support this plea of guilty,” Powell responded: “I do.”
That’s one of the first honest things she has said in a long time. And it pulls the curtain all the way back on the scam Trump and his cronies have been running since the day he lost the 2020 election.

We found room for both hope and pessimism in a recent free expression survey that the University of Chicago helped develop with The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. One of the most worrying results was that not everyone is seen as having the same freedom to speak their minds on college campuses.
People said conservatives had the least freedom to speak, but they perceived problems of exclusion beyond just one group. Asian people also were seen as having less freedom of expression than other groups, and respondents said campuses did the worst at providing an inclusive environment for conservatives, visiting speakers, Asian people and transgender people.
We see related problems for campus expression as people respond to the tragedies of the Israel-Hamas war. Many students don’t feel free to express their views, and some universities risk chilling discussions on their campuses by taking collective positions, sending the message that there is one “official” stance and other opinions are not welcome.
That is a troubling trend in our polarized times. We face huge challenges as a society, and we can’t address them fully if people at colleges and universities – our greatest engines of new thinking and innovation – do not feel free to challenge each other and pursue ideas and breakthroughs wherever they lead.
Sadly, just as the need for new knowledge and discovery becomes more acute, universities have been riddled with challenges to free inquiry from all ideological factions. We find ourselves in something of a moral panic, from which neither the left nor the right is immune. 
But we also see signs that the tide is turning, and fast. Our survey found heartening public support for many aspects of free expression, including bipartisan resistance to state restrictions on what professors at public universities can teach.
Among the encouraging stands that universities are taking on free expression, Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, this year rejected a call for mandatory trigger warnings for potentially offensive course content. In Northern California, Stanford Law Dean Jenny Martinez, who wrote an articulate defense of free expression after the disruption of a talk by U.S. Circuit Judge Kyle Duncan, was appointed provost of the university.
Many schools – including our own – are launching new free inquiry and expression initiatives, while others have adopted the “Chicago Principles” on free expression.
Biden is too old. And so is Trump.As a Gen Z voter, I want younger candidates.
Such bold moves are critical, but they go only so far. To realize the potential of free inquiry we need an active shift in campus culture.
The project of free inquiry and expression is about much more than solitary acts of expression – it’s about unlocking the power of discovery and knowledge in the context of an academic community to address major challenges and promote the flourishing of knowledge.
Freedom of expression on college campuses is not the same as an absence of personal constraint on speech, nor is it grounded primarily on the First Amendment.
Universities are crucibles of truth-seeking, for faculties and students alike. To advance that ideal, they must be places where students and scholars are challenged by alternative viewpoints.
Don't let Israel-Hamas war divide US.We need to cooperate across our differences.
Universities have it in their power to take concrete steps to build stronger cultures of free inquiry and expression, including:
Despite the challenges to free inquiry, we remain enthusiastic about the breakthroughs of human ingenuity and discovery that our colleges and universities will yet make possible. They can’t happen soon enough.
Combining the remarkable burgeoning activity across the higher education landscape with the creativity and passion of Generation Z makes for a very bright future.
Doubling down on free inquiry and expression is the key. Without it, universities will lose all that makes them distinctive.

There’s no contest: people love condiments. From ketchup, to mayo to mustard, condiments are a way to enhance flavors and textures that make an already great dish even better. We love to spread our favorite condiments on sandwiches, hot dogs, burgers and even pizza. (By now you’re either enraged or nodding along.) 
Diets have often demonized condiments because they can add calories, sugar and fat to a dish. But we want to hone in on one condiment in particular – mustard. Should mustard be lumped in with all condiments or does mustard offer unique benefits? We spoke with Lon Ben-Asher, MS, RD, LD/N, Registered Nutritionist and educator at Pritikin Longevity Center to find out everything you need to know about mustard. 
First, it’s worth mentioning that there are many different types of mustard. When you think of mustard, you most likely think of yellow mustard – the traditional bright yellow smooth paste that’s commonly zig-zagged on top of hot dogs and sandwiches. Other less common types of mustard include spicy mustard, dijon mustard and honey mustard. 
Yellow mustard, spicy mustard and dijon mustard all have very similar nutritional profiles. They are low in calories, sugar and fat, which makes them an excellent addition to a dish, especially if the goal is weight management. Ben-Asher explains, “Mustard can be utilized as a condiment which is low in calories and can help with weight management/control by enhancing flavor as an alternative to many high-calorie sauces, marinades and dressings.” 
Honey mustard, on the other hand, is a little bit different. Although its flavor balances sweetness with acidity in a harmonic way, it does add a little bit more calories, fat and sugar to your meal. One serving (1 tbsp) of yellow mustard, for example, has 9.2 calories, and negligible fat and sugar. One serving (1 tbsp) of honey mustard contains 69.5 calories, 6 grams of fat, and 2.4 grams of sugar. These statistics do not make honey mustard off limits, it’s just something you need to be mindful of. 
It turns out that mustard is packed with helpful nutrients. Ben-Asher says, “Mustard provides nutritional value as well by its mineral composition of selenium and magnesium, which are important for many systemic functions.” 
The powerful potential of mustard:How to use the condiment as an ingredient instead
According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, selenium is a trace mineral that is vital for the creation of various enzymes and proteins that help make DNA and protect cells from damage. Additionally, the NIH explains that magnesium is important for muscle and nerve function, regulation of blood sugar levels and blood pressure, and even the creation of DNA. 
Like many nutritious foods, mustard contains antioxidants. Ben-Asher adds, “In addition, mustard seeds contain antioxidant compounds called glucosinolates, which help protect cells from oxidative stress.” 
There’s some information floating around in the internet that says mustard is good for your liver. Turns out, this information is true. 
Ben-Asher explains, “Mustard can offer benefits to the liver in several ways.  It contains some compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties which can be beneficial for liver health. The mustard seeds contain omega-3 fatty acids, which can reduce inflammation and support liver function.  Mustard seeds can also support the liver’s detoxification processes and aid in eliminating toxins and other substances from the body.” 
We’ve learned that most types of mustard are low in calories, fat and sugar, so it seems to be like one of those foods we can enjoy. However, Ben-Asher says that there are still a few precautions, “It is considered safe to consume mustard daily and can be part of a healthy dietary pattern. It can be utilized as a low-calorie condiment to add flavor to foods without having a considerable impact on daily caloric intake. However, it’s important to consider for some individuals that intake may need to be limited or avoided. Although rare, mustard allergies can occur and if any adverse reactions are experienced – it should not be consumed.  Also, if someone has hypertension or other cardiovascular issues, many prepared mustards are high in sodium, therefore you may want to choose a no-salt-added or low-sodium version.”

In excerpts of her upcoming memoir, shared by People, Britney Spears wrote that she became pregnant with Justin Timberlake’s baby and had an abortion because he wasn’t ready to become a father. 
“Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young,” Spears writes in her book, according to People. "If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father."
“To this day,” Spears continues, “it’s one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life."
Spears’ statements underscore the benefits that male partners receive from having access to abortion care — an often overlooked aspect of reproductive health in light of Roe v. Wade’s downfall last year that, if ignored in society and politics alike, perpetuates the idea that abortion is solely a women’s issue.
“Abortion is a highly stigmatized form of healthcare, and women almost always bear the brunt of the stigma and shame around abortion,” said Bethany Everett, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Utah. “Yet, there are likely many people, including male partners, who don’t want to become parents or have another child, who also benefit from abortion access — benefits that are rarely recognized by the broader public or policy makers.”
Everett, who studies the social and political implications of reproductive health, said Spears' claim that Timberlake did not want to become a parent suggests he was aware that a child could “derail his career,” a reality that “men rarely publicly acknowledge” but is critical to recognize in a post-Roe world. 
(On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, leaving it up to states to determine its legality. Some states have since banned nearly all abortions, while others have passed legislation protecting abortion access.)
Timberlake has yet to publicly respond to Spears’ comments.
Andréa Becker, a medical sociologist and postdoctoral research fellow with the University of California San Francisco’s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health program, said this example is “consistent with the literature,” in that “men don’t necessarily have to come forward and tell their abortion stories if they don’t want to, even though it would benefit them immensely.”
This pattern is due in part to a lack of research analyzing how access to abortion impacts male partners, a shortfall that Becker said “reinforces the way we talk about birth control, condom use and pregnancy avoidance as a woman’s responsibility and issue.”
“We just forget about the sperm involved in creating a pregnancy,” Becker said. 
As a result, stigmas associated with abortion disproportionately impact women.
“Men are rarely acknowledged as beneficiaries from abortion access so it is much easier for them to avoid the stigma and shame around abortion if they don’t think it’s something that impacts them personally,” Everett said. 
Data show that 1 in 5 men in the U.S. have been involved in abortion, which researchers say is likely an undercount. It's estimated that about 1 in 4 women in the U.S. will have an abortion by age of 45, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
The total number of abortions in the U.S. is difficult to measure, but the most recent estimates from 2020 show that there were anywhere between 620,000 to 930,000, according to data from the CDC and Guttmacher Institute. (The number of abortions in the U.S. dropped immediately after the fall of Roe v. Wade.) 
Meanwhile, research has found that some men are hesitant to admit their involvement with abortion. In a 2022 study, men were less likely to disclose the fact they were involved in an abortion during face-to-face interviews compared to an online survey.
In one of the few studies to analyze how abortion impacts male partners, Everett found that men who impregnated someone as a teenager were more likely to pursue post-high school education and graduate from college when the pregnancy ended in abortion compared to those that ended in live birth.
More on maternal health care inequities:Inequities in maternal health care access are not new. They have deep roots in history.
“When men don’t speak up, the burden of having to make decisions about unplanned pregnancies and access to abortion falls exclusively on women — and that’s an equity issue,” said Dr. Brian Nguyen, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. Nguyen runs a research group called the EMERGE Lab that conducts studies aimed at ensuring men recognize their responsibility in women’s reproductive health and gender equity.
While questions still abound about what role male partners should have in the abortion landscape, it’s important to recognize the general lack of knowledge about abortion in the U.S., particularly among some men, Becker said. Consequently, research shows many policy decisions now in place threaten the lives of women and girls who would benefit from abortion care, especially for people of color, migrants, people with disabilities, and those living on low incomes or in rural areas.
"Men do have a place in advocating for reproductive rights,” Everett said. “They can donate to abortion funds and reproductive health care organizations, and, importantly, with the consent of their partners, acknowledge how abortion access has benefited them.”
This is the third story in a series exploring grief, how people face it, cope with it and heal from it.
Click here to read the first installment: This family went through an unimaginable tragedy. How YouTube helped. And here for the second: At 25 she found out she had the breast cancer gene. Now, she's grieving motherhood.
Lisa Bowman had everything going for her − until she didn't.
The now 56-year-old was the global chief marketing officer for United Way. United Way, an education, economic mobility and health-focused nonprofit, recruited her.
What should've been a dream job spiraled into a nightmare: she alleged she was sexually harassed at work, and more than 20 former employees of the company said "sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation is commonplace," at the company, according to a 2021 HuffPost report. The nonprofit fired Bowman in January 2020, months after she reported the harassment. Multiple claims have been filed with the EEOC; United Way told USA TODAY it doesn't comment on matters of employment. The CEO of United Way resigned as the chaos swirled.
But Bowman didn't just lose her job. She lost much more.
"The loss of my job was really that loss of my identity," she says. "All of a sudden, I went from being Lisa Bowman, CMO of the world's largest nonprofit where anybody would take my call, people were beating down the door to talk to me, to all of a sudden just being Lisa Bowman, private citizen, with no identity, so to speak. And that was a really, really tough thing for me to navigate."
Grief doesn't apply to death alone. It comes in a series of shapes and sizes different than you might expect. And all can coexist. (You can share yours with us at the bottom of this article).
"There's room enough in the world for all these losses, and one doesn't take away from the other," says David Kessler, grief expert and founder of Grief.com.
Bowman says her grief affected her as a woman: "When I talk about the grief over the loss of a job, I think for women, as we fight so hard sometimes to get to executive levels, and those C-suite positions, when we get there, that job becomes an integral part of our identity," she says. "And so we identify very closely with our role."
She attempted to push through her grief – a "fake it 'til you make it" mentality – the same way she dealt with it at 26 following the death of her mother.
"She never got to see certain things happen in my life. She wasn't there for a wedding, for example, or to see the career trajectory that I ended up with, which have largely been influenced by her," Bowman says. "And in some cases, this is kind of the same thing. I'm missing out on all of those things, because of this loss of a job. And that in and of itself – it's grief. Every time something happens, and I have a financial challenge, it brings it all back."
Bowman confided in friends and family in lieu of professional help. While none could relate to her quandary, they listened to her. Heard her cry.
She later poured those thoughts into a book – "Harasshole" – which, while therapeutic, made it that much harder for her to get a job. Bowman previously had a 15-year stint in executive-level marketing roles at UPS but now freelances.
"It's made it very, very difficult for me to find employment," she says. "I have candidly applied for over 1000 jobs. I've had people tell me that they would love to hire me and they can't, because they can't take a risk with me. I've had job offers rescinded when people have found out about this."
Another kind of grief: missed opportunities.
Bowman's grief is not more or less than any other type of grief. "There's a context to think about it, as sometimes we approach grief like it's a pie," Kessler says. "And it goes wrong if we think, Wait, wait, you're taking some of the pie on your job loss. But I need a lot of it because my spouse died. And that isn't how grief works."
Some might call Bowman's job loss "disenfranchised grief" – a loss not openly acknowledged, socially mourned or publicly supported, according to Loree Johnson, a licensed marriage and family therapist. It's grief felt on an individual level not necessarily seen by others.
Plus, "the emotions can be the same, regarding all kinds of loss," says Amy Morin, psychotherapist and the host of a podcast. "Someone who lost their job may feel sad, anxious, and a bit disoriented, which might be the same feelings someone experiences when they lose a friend or relative."
Read next:At 25 she found out she had the breast cancer gene. Now, she's grieving motherhood.
Today, Bowman's grief hasn't dissipated. It's morphed: "Similar to the loss of a person, the grief doesn't go away. It's just that you get used to carrying it. So it doesn't feel quite as heavy."
For those going through a similar crisis, Bowman offers these words of advice: "You have to realize that it's not your role that defines who you are. It's who you are that makes you you. It's your skills, it's your capabilities, it's the value you provide."

Catching a flight across the country or just having some trouble sleeping? Many people turn to melatonin supplements in these instances for extra help catching some Z’s.
While melatonin does not have huge risk factors tied to it, every supplement can bring side effects if too high of a dose is taken or if used instead of prescribed medicines, according to the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements. 
Whether you are using the supplement to avoid jet lag or fight insomnia, or just want to sleep better, these are the side effects of melatonin and what to watch out for.
Side effects from melatonin are rare, but there is more risk involved when taking higher doses, explained Dr. Hal Alpert, telemedicine consultant for Blue Sleep. Here are some of the side effects to be aware of:
If a person were to take much too high of a dosage, the following could occur, according to Alpert:
Additionally, melatonin can interact with other drugs, so it is important to know when to avoid melatonin depending on any other conditions, said Alpert.
“Melatonin can decrease the effectiveness of drugs for epilepsy and immune suppressive drugs,” said Alpert. “You should avoid using melatonin in pregnant women, breastfeeding women, seizure disorders [and] depression.”
Melatonin can sometimes either raise or lower your blood pressure and make bleeding more likely if you’re on blood thinners, according to Alpert.

NEW YORK – The Rolling Stones will not go quietly.
Nearly 60 years since dropping their blues-steeped debut, the legendary rock band rooted by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards continues to make a glorious noise, continues to pique our attention with every utterance of a new tour and, simply, continues to matter.
The band’s latest album, “Hackney Diamonds,” their first new material since 2005’s “A Bigger Bang,” arrived Friday.
But a few hours before the clock struck midnight, the Rolling Stones roared through a seven-song set that blurred the lines between vintage and fresh – the the dozen tracks on “Hackney” really are that robust – at an invite-only club show at Racket NYC.
“Yes, yes, yes,” Jagger uttered as he roamed the corners of the small stage to greet the crowd of about 650 before offering a sly smile. “We’re gonna play some old, and we’re gonna play some new.”

What Jagger didn’t mention was the band was going to welcome a surprise guest to close their set – and really, how could there not be something special at a show this intimate? – in the form of an absolutely kinetic Lady Gaga, who performs on “Hackney.”
The groove-infested “Shattered,” their 1978 seedy ode to New York, proved the ideal opener for the night. Jagger, his vocal delivery as elastic as his facial expressions, slithered between Ronnie Wood and Richards, his feet following his hips, as he spat the lyrics “pride and joy and greed and sex, that's what makes our town the best” and the famous aside, “shadoobie.”
But first Jagger, Richards, Wood, longtime bassist Darryl Jones, drummer Steve Jordan (who took the seat of the late Charlie Watts in 2021), keyboardist Matt Clifford and singer Chanel Haynes had a few other tunes to unleash.
Seesawing between classic and new, the band stomped through the staccato rocker “Angry,” the Stones-iest Stones song in decades. Richards, all scarves and bandannas, ripped out the instant classic riff, filling in the notes between Jones’ rumbling bass lines.
Everyone on stage appeared to be steeped in joy. Wood, who has endured a few recent bouts of cancer, grinned as he stepped up to solo during “Whole Wide World,” while Jones thundered behind his kit, already a master at Watts’ signature playing style of never hitting the high hat and snare drum simultaneously. (Watts played on two songs on “Hackney Diamonds” – “Live By the Sword” and “Mess It Up.")
Jagger, as if it needs to be said, remains an indefatigable wonder at 80, his moves a blend of peacock strutting and karate chopping, his voice as distinctive and grainy as ever.
While the turbo-charged newcomer “Bite My Head Off” (featuring Paul McCartney playing bass on the album) already sounds primed for the stadiums the Stones still rule, it was the memory-ingrained guitar chords of “Tumbling Dice” and “Jumpin’ Jack Flash” that galvanized a crowd speckled with celebrities including Chris Rock, Daniel Craig, Trevor Noah, Elvis Costello, Diana Krall, Jimmy Fallon and Christie Brinkley.
The band, however, saved its showstopper for the inevitable encore. “Sweet Sounds Of Heaven,” a muscular gospel-blues standout on the new album, was already landing with visceral intensity thanks to Jagger singing like a preacher, drawing the crowd in with his gestures and falling to his knees.
But then Lady Gaga strutted out with her blond hair in a Debbie Harry-esque rocker ruffle, sparkly jumpsuit cut low in the front and divided vertically between pink and black.
She immediately confirmed she is a worthy sparring partner for Jagger as the pair circled one another, each approaching the other as prey. Their intensity was palpable as they traded soulful wails, simultaneously bounced – she in platform heels – and fed off the force of the music. After Lady Gaga tossed down the mic stand in a frenzied moment of singing, Jagger ceded the spotlight to her to close out the song with iron-lunged ferocity.
The two pros were left breathless from being completely possessed by the song, and as Jagger led her to the front of the stage to take a bow with the band, it solidified that not only do the Rolling Stones still matter, but their legacy continues to inspire.

Tyler Perry is ready to show fans who he is in a new documentary.
On Tuesday, Prime Video released the trailer for "Maxine's Baby: The Tyler Perry Story" which dives into the 54-year-old's upbringing and journey becoming one of this generation's most successful filmmakers.
The synopsis for the film said the "entertainment behemoth," who opened at the top spot at the domestic box office in 2010 for four consecutive years, was once just "a man working humbly to heal his childhood trauma by transforming his pain into promise."
The Emmy-winner has previously shared of his difficult upbringing. In an Oct. 6 Instagram post, he shared a clip of a 2018 interview where he opened up about once being "devastated, broke, hungry, homeless."
The documentary's trailer shows that the film will highlight how Perry changed his name, initially born Emmitt Perry Jr., stemmed from his challenging relationship with his father and abusive childhood. The project also focuses on the death of his mother Willie Maxine Perry in 2009, whose health declined as he faced massive career success.
The "Madea" creator's innovation in the industry is another integral aspect of the film, emphasizing how the performer appealed to a community of viewers that were being neglected, the trailer shows.
Among the stars honoring the Hollywood heavyweight is Oprah Winfrey who emphasized that his success should not be belittled and Gayle King who said "there was no denying the talent and the power of Tyler Perry.”
According to an Amazon Studios news release, the documentary dives into "the inner-world of a man, whose story has never fully been told, as he becomes a father and a media mogul with a mission to pave his own road to the top."
Armani Ortiz, who supported Perry on multiple projects, directed the film alongside Gelila Bekele.
"The product is a profound lesson on remembering where you came from to know where you want to go," the news release reads.
Out of all the personality conflicts in the reality TV world, why did God, ABC and/or Gerry Turner end the burgeoning "Golden Bachelor" battle between Kathy and Theresa so quickly?
It was only last week that Kathy plunged the previously collegial mansion into the delicious heart of darkness by mobilizing against Theresa, who played the perfect victim while intensifying Kathy's rage by raving constantly about her deep "connection" with Gerry.
Yet before you could say "Real Housewives of New Jersey," the brewing brouhaha ended abruptly in Thursday's Episode 4.
Savor these fleeting moments in a power episode that featured a pickleball battle for Gerry's affections, a bawdy Never Have I Ever game with ice cream punishment, three women leaving the mansion (one of her own volition) and — saving the best for last — a shirtless Gerry, 72, presenting a rose during a steamy hot tub canoodle. Here's what happened in "The Golden Bachelor" Episode 4:
'The Golden Bachelor' Episode 3 recapThe fight for Gerry Turner's roses is on. Who lost?
This was the cruelest month for therapist April, 65, who had no business going home this early. April audaciously faked a wipeout and ankle injury before Gerry's pickleball tournament, then shooed concerned fellow contestants away so she could lean into Gerry's awkwardly protective embrace.
"The good 'ol mare ain't what she used to be," April said winsomely to Gerry. In the next solo scene, she literally winked to the camera with a sly smile and sotto voce remark, "Actually, I am totally fine." Classic.
April won the women-only Never Have I Ever game with nonstop confessions that included detailed experiences with car sex: "Front seat, back seat, on the steering wheel," she shrugged between bites of ice cream penance.
Inexplicably, Gerry didn't give April a rose.
All about the pickleball game'Golden Bachelor' Gerry Turner courts skills
Retired executive assistant Sandra, 75, is still alive in every way, even if she was last seen on bed rest from the hearty partaking of ice cream during the Never Have I Ever game. (Turns out she's lactose intolerant.) But she pushed through the dairy-filled gauntlet because she's a gamer.
Case in point, Sandra missed her daughter's wedding to impress Gerry in the pickleball tournament. She was a smashing first-timer, with a Jeter-esque lunge shot that should make ESPN highlights and play that propelled her team to runner-up status. (Kathy and hardcore pickleball enthusiast Ellen took the crown).
Gerry insisted Sandra make a joint FaceTime call to her just-wedded daughter. Their FaceTime moment was beautiful, complete with relatable iPhone tech fumbling. "We're too old for this," Sandra said with a smile. Sweet.
Gerry rewarded Sandra, who was too ill for the ceremony, with an early rose.
Fitness instructor Leslie, 64, the self-professed muse to Prince's song "Sexy Dancer," was excused from pickle play after drawing the one-on-one Gerry date. During their golden-light ATV jaunt, Gerry showed four-wheeler chivalry, riding behind Leslie to look after her.
But it wouldn't be a "Bachelor" season without a hot tub kiss. Gerry did not disappoint, after the two gazed into each other's mutually beautiful blue eyes.
Without dousing his rose, the suddenly shirtless Gerry helped Leslie into the tub, which materialized in a picturesque field with Champagne. Their post-rose clinch was PG-13 steamy, even with Gerry's right hand oddly stuck on the jacuzzi wall as if he was seeking the air-jets switch.
Retired educational consultant Kathy, 70, snapped right back into outrage mode after financial professional Theresa, 70, boasted of her first-date details (again) to the group and visiting former "Bachelorette" Trista Sutter. "She could just be the one for Gerry," Kathy said to the camera in an astute moment. "She just can't seem to find the 'off' button."
Theresa tried to patch things up with another apologetic heart-to-heart that ended with Kathy giving her "friendly advice" that would have spooked Tony Soprano.
"Zip it," said Kathy.
This became "Snip it" when Theresa tearfully recounted the exchange to Gerry. But it worked. Gerry was outraged, confronting Kathy with, "I'm beginning to sense a rift here that I'm not happy about!"
"I'm not the villain here," Kathy insisted. But even she could see the game was up. "Because of Theresa, I'm not getting a rose," she groused.
She was right about the rose. Not often portrayed as a healthy model for personal expression, Kathy made a graceful exit, giving a final wave to the group that included Theresa. She drove off in the black SUV with a brittle look of defiance.
"I am who I am and people either like me or they don't," Kathy said in her exit interview. "Rejection is not fun. I might burn the house down before I leave." We think she was joking there.
Retired interior designer Nancy, 61, had a tender Episode 2 Gerry moment, but somehow sensed romantic futility. She voiced her suspicions privately to Gerry that she wasn't going to make the cut.
"I'm really not going to dispute that," Gerry said, sounding like he was giving a statement from his legal counsel.
Power move for Nancy, with her boot cast from pickleball, to just drive off before the rose ceremony that saw April and Kathy leave.
Ellen: The pickleball ace won that showcase and heartily kissed Gerry afterward. She enjoyed more Gerry kisses in a one-on-one moment. Gerry had his eyes open for some. Just saying.
Faith: Working it, but frets about her lack of Gerry time.
Susan: Gerry gave emphatic kisses and a rose quartz gift.
Leslie: That ATV date went deep. Real deep.
Theresa: Kathy hates to be right about this. There's something real between Gerry and Theresa.
Sandra: Gerry hasn't truly realized her greatness, but there's time.
ARLINGTON, Texas – Postseason baseball is not supposed to be like this.
In a sport where you can’t simply go one-on-one, where a pitcher may simply choose not to throw you the ball in a spot you can hit it, where solid contact and 100-mph line drives are no guarantee of success, one player cannot determine the outcome of a game, the fate of a team.
Yet night after night, series after series and now year after year, Yordan Alvarez is the body around which the Houston Astros rotate, digging them out after they fall into a hole, influencing outcomes even when he’s two, three or four spots away in the lineup.  
They are now two games away from a third consecutive World Series appearance and six victories away from defending their championship after a 10-3 thrashing of the Texas Rangers in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, a win that squared the ALCS at two games apiece.
The heroes were many: Jose Altuve got his flowers, celebrated for playing in his 100th postseason game and characteristically banging out three hits. Alex Bregman got the party started, a two-run, first-inning triple igniting a team-wide strafing of the Rangers’ pitching staff.
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
And Jose Abreu, a first-year Astro, administered the kill shot, a three-run home run that put the Rangers to sleep.
It is Alvarez, though, who is bracketed by Bregman and Abreu in the lineup, who banged out two more hits, drove in three more runs and broke a tie by hitting a ball 411 feet for a sacrifice fly, a plate appearance that was the baseball equivalent of a crushing lead block that enabled Abreu to waltz into the end zone.
In eight postseason games, Alvarez is now batting .419 (13 for 31), reaching base at a .471 clip, and has driven in 13 runs. It won’t appear on his playoff game log, but let the record reflect that the hitters in front and behind him in the lineup combined to drive in five runs.
And after getting shut out 2-0 in Game 1 of this ALCS, the Astros have scored four, eight and 10 runs in their next three games. The swagger is back, largely because of their cleanup hitter who often moves in silence but might give Bryce Harper a run as the most impactful hitter in the game.
“Alvarez is on fire right now. And he’s the best hitter in the world,” says outfielder Chas McCormick, whose third career postseason home run gave Houston a 9-3 lead. “So when our guy’s going, and we get Altuve going and Jose Abreu going, we’re one of the best teams in the world.
“Having Alvarez hit like he’s been hitting, nothing can stop us right now.”
Thursday’s action offered plenty of evidence.
For both teams, Game 4 was the get-through game: No Justin Verlander, no Max Scherzer or Nathan Eovaldi or Framber Valdez on the hill. It figured that itinerant starters Andrew Heaney and Jose Urquidy would give way to a bullpen battle, and by the fourth inning, it was 3-3 and those fellows were footnotes.
Dane Dunning, Heaney’s capable piggyback partner, started the inning issuing two walks and a single, and after striking out Alex Bregman, was not going to face Alvarez with the bases loaded.
So Cody Bradford, a soft-throwing but deceptive rookie lefty, was summoned for the impossible task. Bradford was unscored upon in 4⅓ playoff innings this year. But Alvarez was a different ask.
They battled for nine pitches, Alvarez fouling off four pitches, fastballs at 91 and changeups far slower than that, before Bradford finally left one in the zone.
Alvarez clubbed it just to the right of dead center field, 111 mph off his bat and looking for all the world like it was his seventh homer in eight games this postseason. Bradford backpedaled and looked, hoping for the best. The ball went 401 feet and would have been a grand slam in 17 of 30 ballparks, according to Statcast.
In this one, it was a go-ahead sacrifice fly.
Yet for Rangers manager Bruce Bochy, Alvarez was the focal point of the sequence. The three-batter minimum ensured Bradford would have to face Abreu, too.
And if Alvarez was pounding away and softening up a piece of red meat, it was Abreu who got to eat.
He pummeled a Bradford fastball, a low screamer that eventually rose over the Astros bullpen and the first layer of seats, landing in the second level of Globe Life Field. It was 7-3 Houston.
“Yordan's hit two balls 111 to center field that haven't been homers. It’s crazy,” says Bregman, recalling a similar shot in Game 3 that center fielder Leody Taveras brought back over the fence to rob a home run. “I've never seen it before in my life. And for him to come through like that time and time again for us, it's huge.
“And then Abreu coming up with another big swing, it was massive for our team.”
You’d think Abreu had the best job in baseball, hitting behind Alvarez, but the year has at times been a struggle for the White Sox legend. He’s found a groove in October, hitting four home runs, three of them at least 430 feet.
Even if there’s not much on the table when he comes up.
“It’s been difficult at times, I’m not going to lie,” says Abreu through a team translator. “The most important things are the victories. If we keep getting the victories, I’ll continue hitting there.”
Um, why is it so difficult?
“He drives in all the runs.”
When told of his Cuban countryman’s gripe, Alvarez allowed a little grin.
“Like I always say, if they leave a pitch over the middle of the plate, and I’m able to make contact, I’m going to try to drive them in,” he says. “Both of us couldn’t have missed (Bradford). I couldn’t get it done.”
OK, so sometimes he’s pretty modest. But he does have his pride, and a good memory. When asked if this October was his most locked-in, he offered a mild rebuttal.
“I don’t know. I think 2021 was also pretty interesting,” he said, to the laughter of onlookers.
That’s fair. Alvarez posted a .315 average and 1.049 OPS and the Astros reached Game 6 of the World Series before falling to the Atlanta Braves. And 2022 wasn’t too bad.
Who could forget his two ninth-inning home runs to almost singlehandedly knock Seattle out of the AL Division Series? Or his gargantuan go-ahead home run off Jose Alvarado in the sixth inning of Game 6 of the World Series, a shot that made it rain champagne hours later?
But he batted .192 last postseason, drawing six walks to 16 strikeouts. Yet even at his less than best, he had a massive impact on Houston’s championship.
As for this year?
“He’s the best hitter in the game, hands down. He does that every day,” says center fielder Mauricio Dubon, who had five hits in nine at-bats in Games 3 and 4. “It’s a little bit more magnified because it’s the postseason. But he does that every day.
“He can beat you with a single to left field, or he can put it 460 feet dead center. Not many guys can do that. It’s crazy. The other team doesn’t want you to beat him.
“At the same time, it’s inevitable.”
It’s starting to feel that way, even if Alvarez, 26, strangely slips under the radar. The loudest boos during pregame introductions here are for Altuve and Bregman, members of the Astros teams who partook in the 2017-18 sign-stealing scheme.
Yet the Rangers were terrible those years. You’d think the guy squeezing the life out of their 90-win team, unsullied by scandal, might attract more enmity.
Oh, well. The Astros, now in their seventh consecutive ALCS, have responded as both internal and external observers believed – very much alive and likely now the favorites to win two of these final three games.
“When you give hope to the Houston Astros and some fuel, some adversity too, we take that really well,” says McCormick. “We had a huge amount of confidence coming here.”
It’s only growing. Four relievers covered the final 6⅔ innings, with high-leverage stars Hector Neris, Bryan Abreu and Ryan Pressly getting a needed night off. Justin Verlander will pitch Game 5. And the Astros have outscored the Rangers 57-18 the past five games at Globe Life.
They’ll also have the best player on the field, perhaps any field, batting cleanup.
“You can’t pitch around him because there’s danger in front of him,” says Game 4 winning pitcher Ryne Stanek, “and danger behind him. You’ve got to pitch to everybody.”
No, Alvarez is not a one-man team. Just one man who influences outcomes like few before him.
PHOENIX — OK so it didn’t quite have the drama of Luis Gonzalez’s walk-off hit in 2001. 
This was a Game 3 in the National League Championship Series, not a World Series Game 7. 
This didn’t produce a title for the Arizona Diamondbacks over the powerful New York Yankees that made Gonzalez a hero in Arizona. 
But, on a record-setting hot day in Arizona with temperatures hitting 103, the name of Ketel Marte will forever resonate in D-backs history. 
It was Marte’s walk-off single with one out in the ninth inning that not only saved the Diamondbacks’ season with a 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Championship Series, but also prevented manager Torey Lovullo from being vilified all winter. 
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
Brandon Pfaadt, the D-backs’ 25-year-old rookie, was pitching the greatest game of his career Thursday when he looked towards the dugout in the sixth inning and saw Lovullo walking to the mound. He couldn’t believe it. Neither could the crowd of 47,075 at Chase Field. Or even Pfaadt’s teammates. 
“He looked good, man, he was great," D-backs right fielder Tommy Pham said. “If anything, I would have left him in. You don’t want to take out a guy like that with so much momentum on our side. Let him keep going."
Pfaadt had given up just two hits, striking out nine, and had thrown just 70 pitches in 5 ⅔ shutout innings. He joined Don Newcombe of the 1949 Brooklyn Dodgers as the only rookies to strike out at least nine batters without a walk in postseason history. 
Still, Lovullo walked to the mound, and was serenaded by loud boos, with fans showing their disgust at the decision, saying, according to Lovullo, “Has the manager lost his absolute mind?’ 
“I'm sure I was the most unpopular guy in the city of Phoenix, in the downtown area, and maybe in the entire state of Arizona, right? I was booing myself as I walked out to the mound," Lovullo said. “I didn’t need to be in the stands. … 
“I want everybody to know, that is trying to think along with me, that we have a strategy. I have a strategy for everything that's done. Everything that's done has been well talked about. It's not just analytics. I know how quickly playoff baseball can change. 
“So, yes, I am prepared to get booed. I am prepared to get second-guessed. It's my job."
The decision to remove him was mostly scripted, with Lovullo saying before the game that he was counting on Pfaadt to face about 18 batters, which was exactly number Pfaadt saw. Yet, Lovullo brushed back at the notion it was simply a matter of analytics, and that a decision was made without discussing it with pitching coach Brent Strom and his staff. 
“So, the conversations are very typical," Lovullo said. “I’m asking them if the manager is an idiot after taking his out after five and two-thirds [innings]. I know it's a very unpopular decision, but we have great information.’’ 
Pfaadt wasn’t too keen with the decision either, but hey, he’s a rookie. What’s he going to say? Besides, it all worked out in the end. 
“Obviously I'm a competitor," Pfaadt said. “I want to keep going. Everybody does, but at the end of the day, you just have to trust his decision and move forward, go to the bullpen, let them do their jobs." 
Despite a few shaky moments by the bullpen after Pfaadt’s departure, coughing up a run in the seventh inning on reliever Ryan Thompson’s wild pitch, the D-backs quickly recovered to score the game-tying run in the seventh.
It set up the ninth inning with the Diamondbacks capitalizing on veteran closer Craig Kimbrel’s wildness, retiring just one of the four batters he faced, culminating on Marte’s sharp single to center field, setting off a wild celebration. 
And, yes, a whole lot of relief, with the D-backs winning their first NLCS game since beating Atlanta in 2001. 
“It feels great," Marte said. “In my opinion, that’s what we needed right? The support, a little bump, or a little push so we can kind of turn it back against them. ... I’m excited to be fighting."
Really, Marte was destined to be the Diamondbacks’ hero. 
He’s the only guy hitting for Arizona. Marte is 6-for-13 (.462) in the series while his teammates are hitting just .179. 
“He has an unbelievable heartbeat," Lovullo said. “He loves to be in that moment. He is one of our best players for a reason. … 
“Ketel thrives in that situation. He just has the heart of a lion. He wants to get the job done and be the main guy to help his team win a baseball game."
If it wasn’t for Tommy Pham, who was busy putting together motorized rally cars in the clubhouse afterwards, Marte may never have gotten the chance to be a hero. 
Pham, who was in a zero-for-12 slide and struck out in his first two at-bats Thursday, was told that he was going to be taken out of the game for a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning. Yet, he was on the on-deck circle when the inning ended. 
Lovullo stuck with Pham to open the seventh inning, and he delivered a sharp leadoff single to center field off reliever Orion Kerkering. Speedy Alek Thomas was brought in to pinch-run for Pham, and he scored easily on Lourdes Gurriel’s sharp double into the left-field corner, tying game at 1-apiece. 
“They wanted to take me out," Pham said, “but I’ve got to prove them wrong, I guess.’’ 
The Diamondbacks still trail in the NLCS, 2 games to 1, but now have life, knowing that their victory guarantees ace, Zac Gallen, will pitch Game 5 at Chase Field after going with a bullpen-by-committee Friday.
GAME 3 RECAP:Diamondbacks beat Phillies on Ketel Marte's walk-off
“Zac pitching at home, hey, that sounds pretty good," Pham. “I’ll take that any day."
The D-backs still believe, and if nothing else, maybe they created a little doubt that the Phillies won’t steamroll them on their way to a return trip to the World Series. 
“We have a lot of talent on this club," Marte said. “We just have to believe it. And I think we do. We can compete with anybody in this league. 
“You’re seeing that."

Back in the good old days, when Jim Harbaugh was provoking someone in college football on a near-daily basis, nothing could get him rolling on social media faster than an allegation of cheating. 
“If the Georgia coach is implying any intent on our part to break rules, he is barking up the wrong tree,” Harbaugh tweeted on Feb. 24, 2016, after Kirby Smart suggested the NCAA would be forced to step in after Michigan held spring practice at IMG Academy. 
The following year, when ESPN’s Paul Finebaum suggested that Michigan hiring the father of a top recruit to his coaching staff was unsavory (albeit allowed), Harbaugh fired back with a Tweet calling him “Pete Finebaum, the unabashed SEC water carrier.” 
But when you play in the gray area of the NCAA rulebook while walking around like you’ve just been blessed by the Pope, you tend to make a lot of enemies. 
And now that Michigan is residing near the top of college football again, all the fangs are coming out. 
For the second time this year, Harbaugh is in the middle of a snit with the NCAA over potential rules violations that were petty, completely avoidable and ultimately quite stupid if they indeed took place. 
Harbaugh served a self-imposed three-game suspension at the beginning of this season for misleading or not cooperating with NCAA investigators during an investigation into impermissible contact with recruits and coaching activities during the COVID-19 dead period. 
Now, in a story reported first Thursday by Yahoo! Sports and confirmed by the Big Ten, Michigan is under another inquiry for in-person scouting of opponents, which has been against the rules for nearly 30 years and is quite unnecessary these days, unless the goal is to glean extra information about an opponent's play-calls that teams often try to disguise on the sideline.
Now I know what you, the well-informed college sports fan, is thinking. If the NCAA couldn’t pin anything on Kansas basketball coach Bill Self just last week for having Adidas help him recruit players despite years of investigative work and loads of evidence pointing toward a significant punishment, how in the world is Harbaugh going to get popped for relatively petty crimes?
The answer is because NCAA enforcement is a lot like traffic cops. They’re not going to catch everybody. They may pick one speeding car to turn the siren on for over another for biased reasons. But when they have you on the radar gun going 90 miles per hour on the highway, they’re going to write you a ticket — especially if you act difficult and indignant when they pull you over. 
If all of this stuff is proven true, Harbaugh made it easy on them. And given his proclivity toward Michigan Man self-righteousness, the rest of college football is snickering away. 
Selective enforcement? Maybe. 
But the rules Michigan allegedly violated are so clear and straightforward — and ultimately offer so little upside — that all suspicions about the way Harbaugh conducts his program are now completely fair game. 
Back in 2020, when the world was figuring out COVID-19 one day at a time, NCAA schools agreed that it was better for everyone to just take a pause on recruiting and other normal offseason activities.
Is it a huge deal if Harbaugh went to a restaurant with a couple of recruits who were in town during that time? Not really, but it is a willful violation in order to gain a competitive advantage. And then to not be truthful or forthcoming about it with the NCAA? That’s another bright red line that the NCAA has used many times to penalize coaches, because catching them in a lie is one of the few hammers they actually have.
This alleged scouting violation is even sillier. Michigan is 7-0 and has won its games by 27, 28, 25, 24, 38, 42 and 45 points. 
If, as The Athletic reported Thursday, the Big Ten has evidence of a “vast network” being used to steal signs, it's the most comical use of espionage since Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase paired up in “Spies Like Us.”
If you need to steal signs to beat Nebraska and Rutgers, you’re more con man than Michigan Man.
Much of the focus now will turn to whether these dual investigations end up chasing Harbaugh back to the NFL, especially if the Wolverines -- who might really be the best team in the country -- end up winning a national title. 
It’s an interesting topic, but honestly, trying to predict Harbaugh’s mindset or his next move is a lost cause. Before this story dropped, there was talk of another extension in the works. But Harbaugh has said before he’s staying at Michigan one week, interviewed with an NFL team the next and then come back to say it was a one-time thing (at least until the next one-time thing). 
When you're that slippery, aloofness is a helpful trait -- and Harbaugh uses it to his advantage time and time again. 
But the more interesting part of the story is really how this comeuppance has been kind of in the works ever since Harbaugh got back into college football. 
You can stand up and say you do things by the book and take great offense to accusations that you’re shading the rules, but make no mistake: Harbaugh at Michigan has absolutely made a home in the gray area while tacitly accusing everyone else in the sport of being cheaters. 
In 2019, author John Bacon — someone who is closely tied to the Michigan program and wrote a book on Harbaugh — claimed that Rashan Gary was offered $300,000 by another school during his recruitment before choosing the Wolverines (this is before name, image and likeness would have allowed for similar arrangements).
Most people in college sports would look at that claim skeptically — not about the offer itself but the idea that somebody would choose to play for a school offering nothing but the standard scholarship when they could have pocketed $300,000 somewhere else, even if it was against the rules. 
Why even put that out there other than to glorify Mr. “Do it the right way” while casting aspersions on competitors? It’s not just unseemly, it’s phony. Because another huge part of the story in the Gary recruitment was that Harbaugh in 2015 hired Chris Partridge as director of player personnel and recruiting. Who is Chris Partridge? Well, he was the head coach at Paramus Catholic High School in New Jersey, where Gary played until enrolling at Michigan in 2016. 
Again, just like the example that got Harbaugh crossways with Finebaum, it’s not against the rules. Partridge was qualified for the job and is now in his second stint on the Michigan staff after working as the co-defensive coordinator and safeties coach the last three seasons. 
But hiring the high school coach of the No. 1 prospect in the country and then landing that prospect from several states away is a gray-area move. Just like Harbaugh holding so-called “satellite camps” for recruits in Southern states, sleeping over at a recruit’s house or even this summer, when former tight end Jake Butt told a story via X (formerly Twitter) about how Harbaugh exploited a loophole in the practice time limits to get more reps in the spring.
“Harbaugh is great at taking advantage of Grey areas,” Butt wrote.
How long of a leap is it from the gray to outright rule-breaking — even if the rules are picayune? Maybe not that long.
But it's worth harkening back to the prescient words of Kirby Smart from seven years ago, when his little spat with Harbaugh got started over the IMG trip. 
“They're obviously trying to gain a competitive advantage, and that’s their right,” he said. "But I think the NCAA in due time will have to step in. I don’t know how it’s going to go down. It’s going to be interesting too see, though.” 
It sure is. 
Trevor Lawrence has earned a rest.
Playing through a left knee injury suffered four days earlier, the Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback was efficient – if not effervescent – but made his biggest play when his team needed it most. Lawrence’s 44-yard touchdown pass to Christian Kirk with 3:08 left in the fourth quarter proved decisive as the Jags outlasted the New Orleans Saints, 31-24, at the Superdome on Thursday night for their fourth consecutive win. Jacksonville (5-2) extended its AFC South lead while joining the Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins as the conference’s only five-win clubs.
Lawrence completed 20 off 29 passes for 204 yards and, despite the bum knee, ran for a team-high 59 yards on eight carries. Travis Etienne, his teammate since their days at Clemson, scored a pair of touchdowns and linebacker Foyesade Oluokun returned a Derek Carr interception 24 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter.
The win was also Lawrence’s first at the Superdome, his final two seasons at Clemson ending with playoff losses at the famed Big Easy venue.
However, on Thursday, a game the Jags seemed to have in the bag after Oluokun’s score, came down to the wire and likely would have gone to overtime had Saints tight end Foster Moreau caught what seemed to be a gimme 6-yard TD pass from Carr in the game’s final minute. But Moreau couldn’t hang on, and Carr couldn’t convert on his final chance on fourth down as New Orleans dropped to 3-4. ― Nate Davis

Travis Etienne ran for two touchdowns, Foyesade Oluokun returned an interception for a score, and Christian Kirk’s 44-yard touchdown after a short catch over the middle lifted the Jaguars to victory over the Saints.
Jaguars: The Jaguars gave up a 24-9 lead in the fourth quarter, but were able to survive the Saints’ late rally.
The Jaguars broke a four-game losing streak against New Orleans. Prior to Thursday night, Jacksonville’s last victory versus the Saints was on Dec. 21, 2003.
The Jaguars are currently in first place in the AFC South. Jacksonville is 5-2 for the first time since 2007.
Jaguars LB Foyesade Oluokun: Oluokun’s led the NFL in tackles for two straight seasons. His play diagnosis and nose for the football was on display Thursday night.
Oluokun caught a deflected Carr pass and returned it 24 yards for a pick six.
The Jaguars linebacker produced a game-high 14 tackles, two pass deflections, one interception and a touchdown.
Oluokun is a well-respected leader on Jacksonville’s defense, and he shined in the victory.
Travis Etienne reached pay dirt twice: Etienne came into the night with a league-high 113 rushing attempts, 451 rushing yards and five rushing TDs.
The Jaguars running back tallied 77 yards from scrimmage (53 rushing yards and 24 receiving yards) and two touchdowns in the win.
Alvin Kamara only bright spot for Saints on offense: It seemed like Kamara was New Orleans' best and only source of offense for much of the night. Taking handoffs or catching passes out of the backfield, the versatile running back did a little of everything for a Saints offense that could barely move the ball without him.
Kamara had a total of 29 touches (17 carries and 12 receptions) for 153 yards from scrimmage. He led the Saints in carries, catches, rushing yards and receiving yards in the loss.
Derek Carr, Saints offense: The Carr-led Saints offense was booed multiple times Thursday night.
Carr and his wide receivers weren’t on the same page for much of the contest.
Credit to Carr and the Saints offense, they did rally back in the fourth quarter with two touchdowns to tie the game at 24 apiece. But three field goals through the first three quarters wasn’t good enough.
New Orleans’ best offense came on plays designed for Alvin Kamara or Taysom Hill runs.
Carr finished 33-of-55 passing for 301 yards. He had one touchdown and one interception. The Saints quarterback also appeared to injure his groin area late in the game.
Saints' third-down efficiency: The Saints were 3-18 on third downs. The team’s third-down inefficiency probably cost them the game.
Saints' poor red zone offense: The Saints went 2-5 in the red zone. New Orleans’ red zone struggles played a big role why they lost at home.
The most critical red zone mishap came on third down with 30 seconds in remaining in the fourth quarter when tight end Foster Moreau dropped a wide open game-tying touchdown.
Moreau’s drop was a microcosm of the Saints' red zone struggles on Thursday night. ― Tyler Dragon
Saints tight end Foster Moreau dropped a would-be game-tying touchdown in the back on the end zone with 30 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.
The back-breaking drop proved to be costly for the Saints. On fourth down, Derek Carr’s pass to wide receiver Chris Olave was broken up by cornerback Montaric Brown.
The Jaguars were able to get in victory formation after the Saints turned the ball over on downs. New Orleans finished the game 2-5 in the red zone. ― Tyler Dragon
Christian Kirk caught a short pass over the middle from Trevor Lawrence and took it 44 yards to the house.
Kirk made the entire Saints defense look slow after he caught the football and ran up field for the score.
The Jaguars reclaimed the lead, 31-24, after the score.
Kirk has six catches, 90 yards and a touchdown in the game. ― Tyler Dragon
The Saints offense has found some life.
The Saints scored on just three plays after Jacksonville turned the ball over on downs.
Two of New Orleans’ three plays went to wide receiver Michael Thomas, including a great diving catch for a 17-yard touchdown. It was Thomas’ first touchdown of the season.
The Saints scored a two-point conversion after the touchdown to tie the contest 24 apiece.
New Orleans has scored touchdowns on two of its last three possessions after being held out of the end zone for three quarters.  ― Tyler Dragon
A little more than two years ago, Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence fronted the first round of a 2021 NFL draft that included four other passers: Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Justin Fields and Mac Jones. There was little debate at the time that Lawrence, the No. 1 overall pick, was a generational prospect and the best of this bunch, but few could have envisioned he could well be the only one of those quarterbacks to reach a second contract with the team that drafted him.
Lance has already been traded to the Dallas Cowboys, while Wilson, Fields and Jones all face uncertain futures heading into an offseason when their fifth-year options must be picked up or declined. A win tonight would be Lawrence's 18th in the NFL; the other four 2021 first-round QBs have a combined 35 victories. Lawrence's one Pro Bowl nod so far (2022) also matches the rest of the class, Jones earning one as a rookie but nowhere close since. ― Nate Davis
New Orleans was finally able to reach pay dirt.
On fourth-and-goal from the one-yard line, Taysom Hill took a direct snap in shotgun formation and found a hole on the left side for a 1-yard touchdown run.
The Saints are 4-5 on fourth downs in the game. ― Tyler Dragon 
Derek Carr’s forced pass turned disastrous.
Carr tried to force a pass to wide receiver Rashid Shaheed, but it was deflected in the air and intercepted by Jaguars linebacker Foyesade Oluokun, who went 24 yards for a touchdown.
The Superdome crowd booed again after the pick six.
Oluokun’s interception increased Jacksonville’s lead, 24-9. ― Tyler Dragon 
The Saints home fans have seen enough field goals.
The New Orleans crowd booed again when the Saints offense had to settle for three following an 11-play drive that went 52 yards to start the second half.
After the Saints offense was unable to convert a third-and-20, kicker Blake Grupe made a 42-yard field goal to make the score, 17-9.
Grupe’s made three of his four field goals tonight. ― Tyler Dragon 
Since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, Hall of Fame RB Walter Payton is the only player to have more games (25) with a pass attempt, carry and catch than New Orleans utilityman Taysom Hill (20).
Hill has two carries for 12 yards so far tonight. ― Nate Davis
The Saints entered tonight's game with the NFL's sixth-ranked scoring defense. The Raiders never ranked better than 20th in that category during QB Derek Carr's nine seasons with the franchise. Alas, like the other quarterbacks New Orleans has used since Drew Brees' retirement, Carr has yet to engineer an offense able to capably supplement the other side of the ball. ― Nate Davis
The Saints were booed multiple times in the first half after their offense failed to score a touchdown. New Orleans only scored three points off two Jacksonville turnovers.
The Saints offense went 0-2 in the red zone, and they are 1-8 on third downs. ― Tyler Dragon 
Tonight is the first time the Saints' new-look backfield has been completely available. RB Jamaal Williams, signed in the offseason after leading the NFL with 17 rushing touchdowns in 2022 (while in Detroit), started the first two weeks but missed the next four games with a hamstring injury. RB Alvin Kamara, the franchise's all-time leader in all-purpose yards, missed the first three weeks while serving a suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy. And, of course, QB Derek Carr was signed in the offseason as the Saints continue to phase into their post-Drew Brees existence. But not a banner night thus far offensively. In fact, the Saints have only scored 19 points in the six quarters since they demolished the Patriots 34-0 in Week 5. Williams and Kamara have combined for 82 yards from scrimmage, 60 of them receiving yards from Kamara. Carr has completed 11 of 21 passes for 100 yards. ― Nate Davis
Doug Pederson’s fourth-down gamble paid off.
The Jaguars called a fake punt on fourth-and-2. Jacksonville’s special teams unit snapped the football and the punter Logan Cooke threw a perfect pass to Tim Jones for a 13-yard gain.
The fake punt set up a successful 43-yard field goal by Brandon McManus.
Jacksonville has a 17-6 lead. ― Tyler Dragon
The Saints are 0-2 in the red zone in the first half.
Derek Carr and the Saints converted a fourth-and-3 to keep their possession going, but their drive stalled again in the red zone.
On third-and-8 Carr couldn’t find an open receiver so he scrambled right for a short gain. The Saints again had to settle for a field goal.
Kicker Blake Grupe made a 35-yard field goal to cut New Orleans’ deficit, 14-6.
Grupe has now made two of three field goals in the game. ― Tyler Dragon
Entering tonight, Jags WR Calvin Ridley is averaging 4.3 receptions and 60.5 receiving yards per game during his six-game stint with Jacksonville ― right around his career pace outside of his 2020 outlier season with the Atlanta Falcons. That year, much of it played opposite Pro Bowler Julio Jones ― he missed seven games ― Ridley exploded for 90 receptions, 1,374 yards and nine TDs, all easily career highs save the TD production. So is Ridley Batman or Robin? The Jaguars will have to make that determination in the offseason, when his rookie contract ― it tolled one season after his 2022 suspension for a gambling violation ― expires and renders him a free agent (assuming he isn't franchised). Ridley has yet to be targeted in this game. ― Nate Davis
Two first quarter fumbles haven’t slowed down the Jags.
After holding New Orleans to a field goal after a muffed punt, the Jaguars went 75 yards down the field in seven plays to reach the end zone for the second time.
Jacksonville’s touchdown came on a nifty misdirection jet sweep. Jags QB Trevor Lawrence pitched the football to RB Travis Etienne and he raced down the left side for a 17-yard touchdown.
Etienne has six rushes, 30 yards and two touchdowns in the first half.
The New Orleans crowd booed after Etienne’s second touchdown. The Saints are down 14-3. ― Tyler Dragon
The Saints started their third possession on Jacksonville’s 17-yard line, thanks to a Jaguars muffed punt. But Jacksonville’s defense was able to keep New Orleans out of the end zone.
The Saints converted one first down and had first and goal from the 6-yard line, but their touchdown efforts failed on three attempts inside the 10-yard line.
New Orleans had to settle for a Blake Grupe short 23-yard field goal.
Grupe has made one of his two field goal attempts. ― Tyler Dragon
The Saints got quick reprieves from their missed field goal. On the ensuing play, Jags WR Christian Kirk fumbled after a 19-yard gain, the ball forced from his grip by CB Paulson Adebo. New Orleans took over at its own 41 ... but didn't need long to go three-and-out. Yet the Saints got the ball right back on the Jacksonville 17-yard line after Tevaughn Campbell collided with Jags teammate Jamal Agnew, who was trying to field the punt. New Orleans recovered and is back in business. ― Nate Davis
Blake Grupe’s Week 7 is going similar to his Week 6.
The Saints rookie kicker missed two field goals last week, and he missed his first field goal attempt in Week 7.
Grupe sailed a 51-yard field goal wide right on New Orleans’ opening drive. ― Tyler Dragon
Travis Etienne, who entered Thursday leading the NFL in touches (134), became the first running back to score a TD against the Saints since Dec. 18, 2022. The only other rushing touchdown surrendered by New Orleans this season was a 1-yard run by Packers QB Jordan Love. ― Nate Davis
The Saints defense hadn’t allowed an opening drive touchdown all season, until Week 7.
Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars marched down the field on a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown drive in just over five minutes. Jacksonville converted six first downs on its opening drive.
Lawrence completed five of six passes for 60 yards. Running back Travis Etienne reached the end zone on a 2-yard run to give the Jags an early 7-0 advantage.  ― Tyler Dragon
Jaguars vs. Saints begins at 8:15 p.m. ET on Oct. 19.
Jaguars at Saints will be streaming exclusively on Amazon Prime Video and will be broadcast in local markets only.
The Jaguars announced that Trevor Lawrence was active for Thursday night's matchup with the Saints. The Saints, however, will be without two starting offensive linemen, with James Hurst and Ryan Ramczyk inactive.
Jaguars' inactive players:
Saints' inactive players:
Lorenzo Reyes: Saints 21, Jaguars 17
This is a tricky one, with the status of Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence up in the air. But with the quick turnaround with the Thursday game, I would expect Lawrence to be hindered — if he can go at all. If you’re leaning Saints, it might not be bad to jump on this sooner rather than later, assuming the line moves if Lawrence is ruled out.
Tyler Dragon: Jaguars 24, Saints 20
Jacksonville’s won three straight games. New Orleans has dropped three of its last four. Trevor Lawrence’s knee injury is a concern, but the team expects him to play. The quick turnaround favors New Orleans. However, Derek Carr and the Saints are still trying to figure themselves out offensively.
Victoria Hernandez: Jaguars 23, Saints 21
The Jaguars are tried and true on the road and showed last week that their success in London wasn’t a fluke. Yes, it will be harder if Trevor Lawrence is out, but the Saints haven’t found enough consistency to compete with the multi-dimensional Jacksonville offense.
Jordan Mendoza: Saints 16, Jaguars 14
Trevor Lawrence’s health is a big concern, and the Saints defense has only given up more than 20 points once this season. The New Orleans offense isn’t great, but they hold down Jacksonville enough for a close win.
... it's been a minute. In fact, nearly two decades since it happened and is famous for one of the wildest finishes in league history.
That game occurred Dec. 21, 2003, in a game that became known as the "River City Relay." It occurred in Duval County in Week 16 and was a must-win affair for New Orleans' playoff hopes. Down 20-13 with 9 seconds remaining, the Saints scored a remarkable touchdown, WR Jerome Pathon scoring after a series of laterals that covered 75 yards on the final play from scrimmage. Then ... New Orleans kicker John Carney sailed the extra-point attempt wide ride. Jags 20, Saints 19 ... no playoffs in The Big Easy. ― Nate Davis
... was also in New Orleans — and in prime time. It was Aug. 23, 2021 — preseason — a game the Saints won 23-21 on a Monday night. On that evening, then-rookie QB Trevor Lawrence showed his inexperience, taking a huge hit on a third-down run but surviving it. RB Travis Etienne suffered a Lisfranc injury that would ultimately cost him his entire rookie season. And then-coach Urban Meyer was clearly agitated throughout the night, managed the game like it counted in the standings and seemed crushed by the loss — among the attributes that would scuttle his only season as an NFL head coach before he could reach the end of it. Chances are, tonight will go better for Lawrence, Etienne and current head coach Doug Pederson. ― Nate Davis
... and the game actually counted? It was his final game at Clemson, the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day 2021. Lawrence was good that night, passing for 400 yards and two TDs. He was also thoroughly outplayed by Ohio State and their quarterback, Justin Fields, who exploded for 385 yards and six TDs through the air in a gritty performance that advanced the Buckeyes to the CFP championship game against Alabama. ― Nate Davis

Universal Orlando Resort’s festivities will begin in mid-November, where visitors “can experience a mix of merry and mischief brought to life from holiday classics to experiences inspired by pop culture icons,” according to a news release. Universal Studios Hollywood will kick off its celebrations later that month.

The U.S. State Department issued a worldwide travel advisory on Thursday, urging Americans overseas to exercise increased caution.
The travel advisory cited “increased tensions in various locations around the world, the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests.”
The State Department recommended U.S. citizens stay vigilant in locations popular with tourists, and sign up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, which can provide information and make it easier to locate them in an emergency.
"The U.S. Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas," a State Department spokesperson told USA TODAY in an emailed statement. "We take seriously our commitment to provide U.S. citizens with clear, timely, and reliable information about every country in the world so they can make informed travel decisions."
The warning comes as thousands have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war. At least 3,785 people had been killed in Gaza as of Thursday, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, including more than 1,500 children. Over 1,400 people have been killed in Israel, most of whom were civilians.

The State Department raised a travel advisory for Lebanon to Level 4 on Tuesday, warning Americans not to travel to the country “due to the unpredictable security situation related to rocket, missile, and artillery exchanges between Israel and Hizballah or other armed militant factions.” There is also an advisory in place warning against going to Gaza, and urging travelers to reconsider visiting Israel and the West Bank.
Many Americans have been evacuating the region, including on a Royal Caribbean International cruise ship that carried U.S. nationals from Haifa to Limassol, Cyprus, earlier this week.

Whether you're traveling for business or pleasure, flying can be stressful, but it doesn't have to be. There are tips and tricks to getting through airport security faster, and these days many airports have incredible amenities — making downtime between connecting flights all the merrier.
However, sometimes it's not the flying that's formidable but all the planning required before the trip. With that in mind, we answer some of your most-pressing questions by sharing the relevant rules and regulations set forth by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).
If you aren’t aware of TSA rules for packing medication and vitamins, it can cause a real headache at airport security. What you can throw in your carry-on bag or pack in checked luggage depends on the quantity and the type, from powders and liquids to prescription medication and over-the-counter remedies.

The simple answer is yes, but whether you can put it in your carry-on bag depends on how you apply your signature scent — and how much you’re packing. TSA rules vary for packing liquids, aerosols, and gels in your carry-on bag and checked luggage. Familiarize yourself with the TSA protocol before packing your precious products, so they don’t get tossed out at airport security. That would stink.

If it’s less than 12 ounces in the original container, you’re in the clear for your carry-on bag, but there are plenty more factors to consider. For instance, what if it’s not in the original packaging? Are there limits to how much I can put in my checked bag? We decipher all the TSA rules and regulations for packing protein in powder and liquid form in carry-on and checked bags.

Navigating air travel with kids in tow can be challenging, so it pays to know the TSA requirements for traveling with minors. For instance, do kids need ID to fly? That depends. The rules vary by airline and whether you’re flying domestic or international. We cover the pertinent TSA regulations and offer expert tips to ensure smooth travels with your littles.

A TSA lock can go miles to help keep your belongings safe and your bags damage-free, should airport security flag your checked luggage for further inspection. A TSA-approved lock can be opened by airport security officers with a universal master key, avoiding the need to cut through traditional locks to inspect a bag’s contents. Many luggage companies now design suitcases with built-in TSA locks, but you can buy them separately too.

UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay.
Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports.
Their partnership should have been a force for good. Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.
The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.
Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.
But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.
According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.
“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”
In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”
“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”
Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.
The stakes are high for everyone.
Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.
Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.
Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.
Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.
“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”
USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.
Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.
For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.
Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.
For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.
“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”
Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.
Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.
At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.
By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.
Tucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.
Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline
Tucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.
Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.
Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.
Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.
During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.
They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.
In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”
It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.
Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.
Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.
They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.
Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.
By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.
Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.
Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”
Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.
Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.
Twelve days later came the call.
Tracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.
According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.
“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”
Tracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”
She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.
“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”
Tracy said she thought to herself, "Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it." In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”
When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.
Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.
Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.
At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.
Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.
When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.
Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.
Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”
Tucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.
The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.
Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.
She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.
Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.
“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”
The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.
A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.
Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.
Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.
Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.
Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.
Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.
“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.
Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.
Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.
Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.
Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.
They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.
“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”
Michigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.
The case would go forward.
Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22.
He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.
For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.
Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.
An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.
Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.
During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”
Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.
“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”
Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.
Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.
Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.
Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.
At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.
Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.
Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”
Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.
One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.
A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”
“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”

On a sunny Thursday morning, Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker strolled through tomato fields at a farm in Immokalee, Florida, toured its processing plants and loaded baskets of bright green fruit into a truck. 
It was a private event thrown by the school to promote its migrant student services program, which provides financial aid and support to farmworkers seeking college degrees. After the April 28, 2022, tour, disclosed in records obtained by USA TODAY this week, Tucker met with community leaders and alumni.
That night, Tucker would make the now-infamous phone call from his hotel room in nearby Naples, during which he is accused of masturbating and making unwanted sexual comments to Brenda Tracy, a prominent rape survivor and activist he had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence.
Yet, when Tucker met with the university’s outside investigator in March for his interview in the sexual harassment case against him, he insisted the trip was not work-related – a claim the investigator would disprove in her report.
It’s just one example of Tucker failing to keep his story straight at the most consequential moment of his career. 
With his job, reputation and the roughly $80 million left on his contract at stake, Tucker repeatedly made false statements to the investigator and misled her about basic facts, such as his location during the phone call and the date it occurred, a USA TODAY review of more than 1,200 pages of case documents found. 
The investigator, Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, and the news organization both obtained documents and witness statements that discredit key aspects of Tucker’s version of events. 
Michigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sept. 10, hours after Tracy went public for the first time with her story in USA TODAY. On Monday, the school informed Tucker it plans to fire him for cause based on the conduct he had admitted to and the embarrassment he had caused the school. 
Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivor
Although Tucker denied sexually harassing Tracy, he acknowledged masturbating on the call, saying he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex.” Tracy said Tucker’s romantic interest in her was completely one-sided and that she had tried to set boundaries multiple times during their yearlong business partnership.
Per his contract, Tucker has until Tuesday to make a case for keeping his job. Regardless, a formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated school policies against sexual harassment and exploitation is expected to proceed on Oct. 5 and 6. 
Since his suspension, Tucker has issued multiple public statements defending himself, attacking Tracy and accusing Veidlinger of bias. He accused the school of conducting a “sham” hearing and having “ulterior motives.” Yet even in these written statements, the central details of his story changed entirely.
Tucker, who previously hung up on a reporter who called him on his cellphone asking about the case, did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. His attorney, Jennifer Belveal, has not responded to phone calls and emails. Tracy declined to comment for this story.
In the absence of eyewitnesses or recordings, sexual harassment cases usually boil down to whose account is more credible, said Elizabeth Abdnour, a Lansing-based attorney and former Michigan State Title IX investigator who has taken part in dozens of campus cases.
“It’s very, very unusual that you would have some outside piece of evidence that would give you a clear decision,” Abdnour said. “Very often you’re weighing credibility based on little bits and pieces of information.” 
In multiple cases she has worked, Abdnour said the respondents lost because they were found to have a greater propensity for lying than the complainants. The hearing officer must determine how much weight to give Tucker’s false and conflicting statements, Abdnour said, and they could sway the case in Tracy’s favor.
“I believe a fact finder could assess these pieces of evidence about credibility and make a determination that Brenda is more credible than Mel,” she said. “In my experience, a clear sign of a lack of credibility is generally taken very seriously.”
By the time Tucker met with Veidlinger for his interview, he had had months to prepare.
The school had informed him of Tracy’s complaint on Dec. 22, the day after she filed it. Veidlinger had interviewed Tracy and all six of her witnesses by the end of January. Tucker was the only holdout.
Rather than tell his side of the story right away, Tucker and his attorney spent three months trying to stop the investigation, case documents show. They wrote legal arguments urging Michigan State to drop the case and twice approached Tracy’s attorney proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no, and the school pressed forward.
On March 22, the day of his interview, Tucker sent Veidlinger a seven-page written account of his interactions with Tracy and lists of their “currently existing” text message and call history, which he said his legal team had compiled. Only a handful of text messages remained; he and Tracy both told the investigator they had deleted their texts with each other in the months after the April 2022 phone call.
In his interview, which lasted 3 ½ hours, Tucker questioned whether Tracy had mixed up the date of the call. He said he recalled being at his home in East Lansing when it occurred, but his own records showed that he had been in Florida on April 28, attending a charity function that was “absolutely not a University-sponsored event.”
His seven-page account told a different story – that he had called her while he was “alone in a hotel room.”
Veidlinger does not appear to have asked Tucker about the discrepancy, based on case documents. But by then she knew what he told her in the interview was untrue: she had already obtained records proving he had not been home in East Lansing.
An expense report he had submitted to the university for reimbursement of his hotel and meals shows Tucker flew to Naples, Florida, to attend a golf fundraiser hosted by The Greg H. Montgomery Jr. Foundation for Ultimate Growth, which raises awareness for suicide prevention. It showed he stayed at the Hilton from April 27 to 29, that the trip’s purpose was “administrative” and that it did not involve personal travel. He had flown there on a donor’s private plane.
The trip is when Tucker toured the farm in Immokalee to help promote Michigan State’s College Assistance Migrant Program. The event was titled “Working to make dreams a reality,” according to an agenda obtained from the university by USA TODAY through a public records request. The agenda features Tucker’s name prominently. Tucker posted photos from the tour on his Twitter account.
That Tucker was on a university-sponsored work trip during the incident was a contributing factor in the university’s determination that it had jurisdiction to investigate, the investigation report shows. 
Tucker’s lists of calls and text messages also were missing an important detail: They did not show any communication with Tracy on April 28. He acknowledged in the interview, however, that he had not reviewed the lists before submitting them and that they may have been incomplete.
Tracy, meanwhile, had already provided Veidlinger with her official cellphone records from Sprint that confirmed the date of their call: April 28.
Tucker and Tracy did not speak in the three months after the April 28 call.
Meanwhile, their assistants were planning Tracy’s third visit to campus – an in-person training with coaches and players scheduled for July 25.
Tucker canceled that training three days before, the investigation report shows. When Tracy spoke to him by phone on Aug. 2 seeking to find out why, she would tell the investigator in her interview that Tucker insinuated he would harm her career if she spoke about his conduct. He never rescheduled her visit, and they never spoke again.
The cancellation became a key focus of the investigator – one of a series of alleged incidents that taken together would meet the definition of sexual harassment, which can include pressuring someone into engaging in sexual behavior for an employment benefit and threatening that rejecting such behavior will carry a negative consequence.
“Reported allegations that a University employee is engaging in misconduct within the vendor-vendee relationship for which they are the decision-maker, and/or impeding in such a services relationship based on a quid-pro-quo sexual harassment allegation, is within a University sponsored program or activity,” Veidlinger wrote in the report, so school policy covered it.
Tucker tried to distance himself from the cancellation in a public statement on Sept. 11, the day after Michigan State suspended him without pay.
“I never cancelled any presentation,” he wrote. “Given a personnel change and scheduling challenges as football season approached, we merely postponed it until January 2023. She chose to file her complaint instead of proceeding with the training.”
But that statement contradicts what he told the investigator. When Veidlinger asked in his March interview if he had a role in canceling Tracy’s visit, Tucker said, “Yes, absolutely I did,” the report shows, and that he did not recall any discussions about rescheduling Tracy for January. Such timing would not make sense, he added, because most of his new players would not yet be on campus. 
Tucker also told the investigator why he canceled the visit, blaming it on a scheduling conflict. He said he had recently hired a mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, who needed to implement his new program on short notice. There was limited time in fall camp, Tucker said, and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” the players. He said he decided to yield the time to Newman.
Veidlinger, however, would later obtain records showing Newman did not meet with the team on July 25, the day of Tracy’s planned visit. He had been meeting with them weekly since June 6, the records showed but held no meetings between July 15 and July 28.
One of Tucker’s assistants, who is a witness in the case, also told the investigator that Tucker asked him via text message to cancel it. He said he was never instructed to reschedule. 
In his interview, Tucker told Veidlinger that his relationship with Tracy frayed after the April 2022 phone call – not because of the incident, but because of information he learned after that caused him not to trust her.
According to Tucker, an associate of his had told him over the summer that Tracy’s assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, had been gossiping about Tucker’s marriage, telling others it was “on the rocks.” Tucker said he was “devastated” because he had confided in Tracy about his marital problems, and he believed she had discussed them with Alvarado.
Tucker confronted Tracy about the alleged gossiping during the Aug. 2 phone call, they both told the investigator. Tracy said he berated and bullied her, repeatedly saying he could not trust her. She said she told him she did not know what he was talking about.
Alvarado – who was killed in a car crash in June – would deny discussing Tucker’s marriage with anyone in her January interview with Veidlinger. 
During the Aug. 2 call, Tracy said she pressed Tucker to identify his source – the associate. She told Veidlinger she believed Tucker had made it up as a pretext for canceling her visit and ending her relationship with the school.
Veidlinger also asked Tucker to reveal the source of his claim, but he refused to say. In her report, she wrote that he said he had “given (his) word that (he) wouldn’t divulge their name.” 
Tucker never revealed the associate’s name to the investigator, nor did he identify anyone who could support his version of events. In his Sept. 11 public statement, however, he lamented that the hearing would not afford him the opportunity to “offer any substantive evidence of innocence.”
It was not the only claim he attributed to his anonymous associate. In his interview, he said that same person told him that ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating how Tracy “goes about her business” by claiming to be a rape survivor.  
Tucker said this further caused him to believe Tracy was untrustworthy because she believed Lavigne was her friend but didn’t know she was investigating the rape story at the center of her public persona. 
It turned out to be yet another falsehood.
Reached by USA TODAY, Lavigne said in an emailed statement that she was “perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.” She said Tracy has been a source of information for her for several years, and that she has featured Tracy’s comments and advocacy work in multiple news stories.
“That has been the extent of my reporting on Tracy and her organization,” Lavigne wrote. “Neither the organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting.”
Asked who might have told Tucker this misinformation, Lavigne responded, “I have absolutely no idea who would have alleged this to anyone.”

The bullets came in plywood crates. 
Any given box was about the size of a small microwave oven. The printed label stuck to each one demonstrated a militaristic brevity. “CARTRIDGES FOR WEAPONS, INERT PROJECTILE,” next to a bright yellow hazmat sticker, “EXPLOSIVES.” 
Inside the boxes: drab green steel cans of .50-caliber ammunition. Each round was giant, more than 5 inches long, built to be fired from a gun so big it is typically bolted to a truck. The bullets were clipped together in long strands for rapid, machine-gun fire. 
By the time Bill Brown got to the boxes, they sat double-stacked eight high atop wooden pallets inside a Missouri warehouse. The pallets went on, row after row. Three million bullets in all. 
It was enough ammunition to feed a single machine gun – if fired nonstop at its rated speed eight hours a day, seven days a week – for almost six months. 
Brown’s job was to get it out of there and toward the Ukrainian front lines. The faster, the better. 
“War is bad,” Brown said. “Loss of life is bad. But at the end of the day, it’s very profitable and injects revenue into this military industrial base.”
There would be virtually no public record of this Ukrainian arms shipment. As a weapons dealer, Brown’s company would deliver the bullets under a system known as a direct commercial sale. The ammunition required a State Department signoff – but the secret deal would never appear in a White House announcement or the Congressional Record. 
Instead, it was part of a shadowy system of brokers, exporters, arms dealers and country-to-country transfers that has become one part of the race to meet demand on distant battlefields. 
Western weaponry fueled Ukraine’s summertime counteroffensive along a 600-mile front. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the effort was delayed in part by the wait for more arms. Amid concerns about that slowly progessing counteroffensive, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday with a promise of up to $175 million more in military equipment. 
Most of America’s $44 billion in documented support to Ukraine came in the form of old U.S. military stock, donated directly by the federal government. In general, commercial sales over $14 million, and sales of military-grade weaponry like mortars or missiles, require State Department approval and congressional notification.
But other aid comes via private sales. 
More than 14,000 U.S. entities are registered to conduct defense trade activities. Their deals are monitored by an alphabet soup of agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Trade secrecy clauses in federal law mean this flow of gear, weapons and ammunition is almost never revealed to the public.
Brown, who works for a small Nevada-based logistics company called Battle Born Munitions, provided USA TODAY with a rare look behind the curtain of these private sales. Details about the shipment were verified by his employer and the European government that made the purchase. State Department officials declined to answer questions about the specific shipment Brown described.
This March sale and the secret number of other shipments like it fuel Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion. Those sales also release an unknown amount of weaponry into the world. What becomes of that weaponry after it’s sold – and especially after it’s delivered – is difficult to track. 
As Brown surveyed the warehouse in Missouri, a crew steered forklifts and skid lifts among the stacks of plain wooden boxes. From high in the trusses, suspended lamp fixtures bathed the boxes in artificial daylight. Brown lifted his camera and started snapping photos. 
In just a few hours, he and his cargo would be boarding a jumbo jet. Three million bullets would climb to the stratosphere and hurtle across the north Atlantic toward a European dawn.
From Ukraine:War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented. So is the country's push for swift justice.
The bullets had once been bound for Saudi Arabia. 
Lot number SMQ19K401L026 had rolled off the assembly line in 2019 at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Kansas City. Lake City, owned by the government and run by a contractor, sprawls across nearly 4,000 acres of green Missouri farmland. Roads curve past World War II-era bunkers known as igloos, spaced out amid the countryside – far enough apart that an explosion in one won’t trigger a chain reaction in the others.
Lake City has been pumping out ammunition almost without pause since 1941. It is the largest small-arms manufacturing plant in the world.
Today the plant is run by Olin-Winchester, but in 2019, the bullets were made by some of the 1,700 workers employed by Northrop Grumman. And in 2019, Saudi Arabia was stocking up on weapons during the Trump administration, fueling the war in Yemen and other conflicts that drew criticism from congressional Democrats.
The plant manufactures .50-caliber ammunition on a rolling basis, for both military and commercial buyers. That’s a testament to just what a legend the bullet – and the gun that shoots it – has become.
In 2019, the technology was already a century old. The .50 caliber was the brainchild of American gunsmith John Browning during World War I. Built to respond to German anti-tank rifles, the M2 was first tested in 1918, and it entered widespread service in 1923. It earned the nickname “Ma Deuce” and has served in combat ever since, bolted to trucks, ships, planes and handheld stands on the battlefield.
The .50-caliber rounds – named for their diameter, about half an inch – can easily hit targets more than a mile away. At closer ranges, they will blast through solid concrete or armored vehicles. The gun can fire at a sustained rate of about 40 shots per minute.
Military setups use strings of “linked” ammunition to feed into machine guns. Spaced out after every fourth bullet, so-called tracer rounds have small pyrotechnic charges that illuminate the line of fire, aiding in targeting.
The gun’s longevity and versatility made it popular for militaries the world over. But this particular batch of bullets wouldn’t end up being sold to Saudi Arabia. 
The Biden administration put a temporary freeze on sales to the Saudi government in 2021 as it reviewed weapons deals approved under Donald Trump. Instead, Brown said, the bullets were sold to a U.S. ammunition provider, only to be held up again. Ultimately, they were mothballed. 
Then, in spring 2023, the bullets found a buyer, or actually two: first Battle Born; ultimately, the Netherlands. 
The European country, a NATO ally, needed a big supply of ammunition. It wouldn’t be keeping the bullets but giving them to Ukraine. Its purchase, essentially a donation, would count toward the country’s required NATO contribution. 
Brown had a line on exactly what they needed. It was sitting in the warehouse in Missouri. 
He arrived in March to personally oversee the shipment. As he prepped for delivery, Brown dropped tiny black tracking devices onto several of the pallets. Just $55 apiece, the units use GPS and cell signals to keep tabs on the load. The idea was to ensure it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands. 
But packing up the bullets was just the beginning. As with anything that’s deadly and made of metal, the shipping costs can be extreme. 
Brown said the question for the buyer was simple: “How fast do you want it? Forty-five to 60 days on a ship? Or in five days if I fly it?”
Brown – or Chief Bill, as he prefers – is a no-nonsense 35-year veteran of the U.S. Army and former helicopter pilot. He retired as a chief warrant officer and lives in Orlando. 
Now 59, he still spends a lot of time on the road – 10 international trips this year. He says his arms logistics work takes him to places most Americans would rather avoid – near the Syrian border or to unstable regions of Iraq.
He’ll travel halfway around the world, he quips, “have some soup, and go back to Warsaw to head home.” The trips aren’t really about the destinations. They’re about the cargo. 
On that spring day in Missouri, forklifts carefully loaded 107 pallets of the ammo onto 18 flatbed semitrailers. They’d all make the eight-hour drive to O’Hare International Airport. 
In Chicago, two Boeing 747-400s operated by National Airlines would be ready for the freight. 
Four pallets each were stacked and shrink-wrapped to create “air pallets” or “cookie sheets” weighing 12,800 pounds. Each plane could carry up to 17 of the pallets that ran the length of each plane secured by white cargo netting.
Flight records Brown provided show the two planes departed about seven hours apart, one in early afternoon, one after dark. 
The flight would take nine hours. Brown wasn’t going to the Netherlands, even though it was the buyer. The planes were bound for Rzeszów, Poland. 
The ancient city sits at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland. It has a gleaming modern airport next to a major east-west freeway. From there, it’s barely 60 miles to the border with Ukraine. 
It was an expensive journey. The trucking company’s bill for those 18 semis? $85,000. Chartering the two 747s? $625,000. Each.
But this shipment of .50-cal rounds was profitable for Battle Born Munitions, according to Brown.
The company purchased the 3 million rounds from Northrop Grumman at a bargain and resold them for more than double the price. (In subsequent interviews, representatives at BBM disputed the specific totals Brown mentioned, saying the accurate figures were protected by “various commercial and government non-disclosure agreements.” They did not dispute the other specifics of the deal he provided.) 
Retail prices for .50-caliber ammunition run roughly $5 per bullet. At that rate, the whole shipment would have been worth $15 million.
The pricing might also be elastic. The Dutch mark up the price of the bullets and count it toward their NATO contribution, pegged to a percentage of gross domestic product, Brown said. The Netherlands has contributed about $15 billion to NATO this year, or about 1.7% of its GDP and just under the NATO mandate of 2%.
Representatives of the Dutch military confirmed the shipment to USA TODAY but declined to comment further about the pricing or details.
The war in Ukraine has only increased the demand for private deals. The State Department signed off on more than $154 billion in commercial arms deals directly to foreign countries in 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year. 
Direct commercial sales represent a modest portion of the contribution to Ukraine compared with the $44 billion donated by the U.S., but they still amounted to more than $600 million in sales from U.S. companies to the Ukrainian government last year alone. That doesn’t include sales to other countries that also support Ukraine – sales like the one Brown described.
Jim Bartlett, an attorney with expertise in the specialized international arms transactions, said private U.S. businesses are playing a small but important role in the conflict.
“American companies are happy to export defense articles to foreign buyers approved by the U.S. State Department,” Bartlett said. “There’s an effort at the State Department to quickly clear the ones headed for Ukraine. … You get head-of-the-line privileges.”
Those sales also come with risks. 
Direct sales face fewer regulatory controls, oversight and enforcement, said Robert Nichols, an international military sales expert and attorney at the law firm Nichols Liu.
“You can imagine the range of characters involved in supplying a war effort,” Nichols said. “Some are highly credible. Others will skirt the law and sometimes step over the line by paying bribes, committing fraud and hiding their transactions.” 
So far, the Department of Justice has indicted just a handful of arms brokers over deals related to the war in Ukraine. Court records show the government has charged Miami-based Oleg Patsulya and Vasilii Besedin with illegally attempting to sell American-made aircraft parts to Russia. They allegedly lied to Commerce Department agents and told them the parts were bound for Turkey. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges this summer. 
A State Department spokesman declined to provide details of enforcement actions but said, “The United States takes seriously our responsibility to protect American military and dual-use technologies and prevent their diversion, including through strong enforcement actions.”
NATO said it oversees allied arms deliveries, and that those arms generally reach Ukraine. NATO itself technically only provides non-non-lethal aid, like fuel, medical supplies and generators.
Brown, of Battle Born, says he fields calls weekly from “clowns” without the proper licensing, whom he reports to the State Department for potential violations. Some raise red flags when they approach him about transactions that include payment via diamonds or gold.
He prefers traditional wire transfers with approved sales partners since he knows government officials are watching. He validates the contracts and checks certificates for the final users. That’s part of why he traveled with the ammunition. He would be meeting a Dutch military official for the official handoff.
“My job is to keep us all out of jail,” Brown said. 
The two 747s touched down in Poland, one before the sun, the other in late morning. Brown exchanged paperwork with a young Dutch military staffer who signed for the delivery, he said. They traded military patches as souvenirs. They snapped a photo together. 
The bullets bought by the Netherlands would never touch Dutch soil. 
U.S. aid:Billions from the US flows to Ukraine. Here's where it comes from, and how it adds up
Despite playing a small role proportionately in the war, $600 million in direct commercial sales can buy a lot of small weaponry. 
And those weapons are the kind most apt to fall into illicit use, said Elias Yousif, a research analyst at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit think tank.
Put another way: It’s hard to sneak away an F-16 or a missile launcher the size of a tractor-trailer. But a bunch of guns or a pallet of ammo? Much easier to resell. 
“In the commercial sector, especially in a new market, the risk increases,” Yousif said.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss arms research project, estimated that within a year, battlefield seizures and other forms of diversion led to 300,000 small arms and light weapons going missing, including 100,000 in Crimea alone.
When small arms go missing, they can go missing into another country, maybe one led by a despot or even a terrorist organization.
The U.S. government says diversion of American donations has been widely absent so far in Ukraine. That could be a combination of intensive “end-use-monitoring” programs and the reality of the battlefield, where supplies are rapidly put to use.
But even if not now, unused ammo could be resold someday. 
“History shows us this isn’t a short-term issue,” Yousif said.  “These are commodities with very long shelf lives.” 
Florida-based Global Ordnance, another State Department-licensed exporter, is a competitor in the direct weapons sales business. General counsel Bryan Van Brunt said the company has extensive protocols in place to track shipments and make sure the end-users are federally approved, though he declined to provide specifics about those systems. 
Brown, with Battle Born Munitions, says the company employs a mix of simple and sophisticated tracking technology to ensure his shipments are tracked to end users. The black GPS devices he dropped onto his cargo tracked the ammo all the way across the globe.
But that system only works as long as Brown is actually tracking. “Technically, my role ends when I deliver it to NATO,” he said.
Sometime after the 747s touched down in Poland, along with signing the paperwork and snapping a selfie with the Dutch official, Brown found the tiny black GPS trackers and lifted them off the pallets. 
Ukrainian trucks would arrive at the airport to pick up the ammunition. They would point toward the border, and onward to Lviv, and some distant battlefield. 
Brown would point in the opposite direction. Just like one of his quips: Fly in, have soup, get home. He headed toward Warsaw, with the GPS trackers in his bag.

The geography professor didn’t hide his clown fetish or the fact that he sometimes indulged his urges by recruiting students as subjects. He posted regularly about it on social media.
“I have a facepaint fetish and convince the cute girls in my classes to let me paint their faces,” he once wrote.
Yet Joseph Tokosh held jobs at two colleges and was on the tenure track at a third before student journalists at Nicholls State University in Louisiana exposed his behavior. He submitted his resignation the same day their story was published.
His interactions with students and open discussion of his fetish happened in both mainstream and tailored digital spaces. He popped into Facebook groups geared toward new students and niche forums on websites like Reddit. He posted videos on YouTube. In one Reddit post on a forum meant to highlight hard-to-believe stories, Tokosh posted pictures of several women in white face paint.
Over the years, two students reported him to campus police; others complained online. He left Kent State University after pleading no contest to something different: a theft charge that involved entering his peers’ offices without permission and taking a USB drive. Tokosh has not been charged with any other crime.
Tokosh’s career trajectory exposes inadequacies in the background check system that colleges and universities are supposed to have in place to protect students – especially when evidence of the concerning behavior resides largely on the internet. Nicholls State, for example, told USA TODAY Network reporters it does not routinely check social media for new hires.
A federal law intended to ensure the academic privacy of students also makes it difficult to determine how Tokosh was able to move so freely from campus to campus. Both Kent State and Northern Illinois University – where he taught while finishing his doctorate – noted Tokosh’s protected status as a graduate student in declining to answer questions.
Sophie Levan was a freshman at Kent State in 2017 when she encountered Tokosh, then 28, in a Facebook group intended as a gathering place for new students. Tokosh had offered cash to anyone willing to let him paint their faces. Levan, then 18, agreed.
The money was appealing but the interactions soured. 
Tokosh, she said, insisted he come pick her up and take her to the building that housed the geography department, where he would paint her face. Uneasy, Levan stopped responding. Tokosh got angry and wouldn’t give up, she said, which led her to file a police report.
“I felt like the school would want to know about it,” Levan said. “I thought maybe they could prevent anything bad from happening since other girls would go with him.”
She said there was never any followup from campus police – or anyone else.
USA TODAY Network reporters reviewed the experiences of six students who were the subject of Tokosh’s attention going back to his time at Kent State.
In addition to Levan, the other person who reported Tokosh to campus police could not be reached for comment. The two who expressed public concerns on social media told USA TODAY they never heard from their campus officials either.
USA TODAY attempted to reach Tokosh via phone, social media and a certified letter. A person answered a phone call to a number associated with Tokosh, but he hung up after the reporter identified himself. A reporter also reached someone who identified herself as Tokosh’s mother. She said she would pass along that reporters were trying to reach him.
Tokosh told the Nicholls student journalists that he did have an assignment where students were required to paint their faces as part of a cultural exercise. Prior to the article in the student newspaper The Nicholls Worth, the university had already cut Tokosh loose. He said his contract was not renewed because he was the target of a “grade inflation task force.”
The university, however, “does not have any such task force,” according to Nicholls spokesman Jerad David.
Tokosh also told students the face painting was a requirement in his cultural geography class to better understand other cultures. In a video interview with Hannah Robert, the station manager for the student-run KNSU TV, he says: “That's an assignment in one of my classes where they actually come up with their own face paint and makeup design inspired by a culture and they implement it.”
It’s a well-established trend in the academic world for professors to bounce from one institution to another without having to disclose why they left their last post, said Julie Libarkin, an associate dean at Michigan State University. She has seen the pattern often in her work maintaining a database of publicly documented sexual misconduct by faculty and staff.
As for grad students? Libarkin said people have requested she add them to her list, but universities’ conservative interpretations of the law get in the way.
“I don’t on purpose,” she said, “because that’s information that almost never comes out.”
Tokosh arrived at Kent State in 2015 with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in geography from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, according to his curriculum vitae. He was working toward his doctorate and researched fading businesses. His work about shopping malls in the Rust Belt won several awards. Like many graduate students, he also taught classes.
Then, Tokosh started showing up in the Facebook groups for new students. In a December 2017 post, an account under the name “Joe Tokosh” posted several pictures of women made up to look like clowns or skulls.
“If anyone is looking for some extra cash, I am looking for people to practice facepainting on!” he wrote. “I will literally pay you!”
Those are the types of posts that caught Levan’s eye. Not only was she pressed for cash, she was interested in movie makeup and thought the face painting could be fun based on the photos Tokosh had posted. But Levan said she soon realized that those images were stock photos and not representative of what Tokosh could do.
What’s more, she figured out that he was a graduate student, a fact she said he didn’t disclose in his posts.
When Tokosh offered to pick her up from her dorm, she refused. But, she said, Tokosh kept insisting she agreed to participate. Levan stopped responding to his messages and filed a police report with the Kent State police in January 2018. They advised her only to stop talking to Tokosh, she said, and let them know if “anything of consequence occurred.”
Months after she refused to meet up and filed the police report, Tokosh texted a picture of himself wearing white face paint to her cellphone. It arrived at midnight and contained no message, although writing on his shirt read: “I'm not a failure.”  
“There was some negative intention with sending that photo,” Levan said. “It’s definitely burned into my mind.”
What Levan didn’t know is that campus police had been put on notice a year earlier when another student filed a similar report. That student told police Tokosh reached out to her and her friends after they posted their numbers on a Facebook group for undergraduates. He would send “get to know you” messages, the police report said, and then ask the student if she was “interested in having her face painted for one of his class projects.”
When she found out Tokosh was a graduate student, she said no and eventually blocked him on Facebook and Snapchat, according to the report. Tokosh continued to text her.
“She does not have any concerns for her safety, but just wanted this documented,” the police report read. 
In July 2017, another student had retweeted a message from Kent State’s Twitter account that asked for Kent State love stories. She wrote: “A geography professor requested me on facebook and asked if he could paint my face like a clown.”
The student confirmed to USA TODAY that the professor was Tokosh and shared a screenshot of a Facebook friend request he sent her. She said she suspected Tokosh also found her on a freshman Facebook group because she posted there often.
She said she tweeted to draw officials’ attention to it and moved on but now wishes she had reported it officially.
College campuses are supposed to offer students special protections from sexual harassment even when it falls short of criminal behavior. Title IX, often associated with equity in women’s sports, also addresses “sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence” at schools that receive federal funding.
Colleges infrequently and unevenly enforce the rule, however. A 2022 USA TODAY investigation found just one of every 12,400 students was suspended in connection with sexual misconduct.
The student who shared her story online said the only response she received was from a graduate student in the geography department, who contacted her on Oct. 1, 2018. In an email, he wrote that he had seen her post and suspected he knew which faculty member had asked her about face painting.
“I brought it to the attention of some of our faculty because I was pretty sure I knew who it was, but they were certain it wasn’t that individual and that you probably just meant geology,” he wrote. 
He went on to reference another student being “approached in (at least by just looking at your tweet) a much more aggressive way.” The grad student asked the undergraduate for more information, but, she told USA TODAY, she didn’t respond. She said she started drafting a reply, but a year had passed. She wanted to move on.
Kent State would not say whether any actions were taken after the students’ reports, but Eric Mansfield, a spokesman for the university, said the police department confirmed that the students who filed police reports were provided with “university resources, which would include other non-criminal avenues to pursue (Counseling Services, Title IX, Center for Sexual and Relationship Violence Services, etc.) as a general police practice.”
Levan does not recall police offering her services, but she said she didn’t want counseling. She wanted Tokosh investigated.
Mansfield also said that the university monitors social media but that colleges “can’t always see or track every mention on social media.”
Police records show that officers did investigate when Tokosh was accused of breaking into geography department offices. A blotter item in the local newspaper shows police obtained an arrest warrant in connection with a third-degree felony burglary charge. Court documents indicate Tokosh pleaded no contest to a theft on Oct. 19, 2018.
Kent State would not explain what led to Tokosh’s departure during that fall semester. Instead, the university said that since Tokosh was a graduate student, any information about him was protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It also would not say whether school officials shared Tokosh’s disciplinary record with other colleges or even if it was standard practice to do so for grad students.
“Due to FERPA, student education records are private,” said Emily Vincent, a university spokeswoman. “Also, we do not comment on personnel matters.”
When Congress passed FERPA in 1974, its author, Sen. James L. Buckley of New York, said the intent was to protect the academic privacy of students and their families. In more recent years, Buckley has become critical of the law and how schools interpret it. He told the Columbus Dispatch in 2010 that “the law needs to be revamped.”
Survivors of sexual violence and students accuse universities of using the law to avoid negative media coverage. Students with a history of bad behavior may jump from one school to another without the public ever knowing about their histories. Law enforcement records don’t fall under FERPA’s purview, but a wide variety of questionable behavior does.
One case involved Brandon Austin, who was accused of sexual assault at Providence College in 2013 while on the school’s basketball team. But Providence College initially said Austin was suspended for violating the school’s code of student conduct and declined to share further details with the Providence Journal, citing federal privacy laws. Austin denied wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime. 
Austin was able to transfer to the University of Oregon, where he was again accused of sexual assault, along with other players. Police investigated the claims, and the local district attorney declined to press charges. The university expelled him anyway but raised FERPA when it declined to release records showing what Oregon knew about the allegations, according to the Oregonian.
LeRoy Rooker was the director of the U.S. Education Department office that oversaw FERPA for more than two decades. Rooker, now a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said FERPA is not a confidentiality law – it is focused on education records. And it doesn’t apply when a student is “seeking or intending to enroll” at another college.
Therefore, Rooker said, Kent State could have shared information about Tokosh with Northern Illinois.
Rooker also said FERPA would not have prevented Kent State from telling reporters if other universities had inquired about Tokosh, though they could not have disclosed what they shared.
He blamed the overuse of the law on fear of being sued.
“In this litigious age, institutions get a little wonky about whether they will forward, say, disciplinary records,” Rooker said. “On the other hand, if you have something and you don’t share it when you can and something happens at the next institution, I would say that’s a big liability.”
Backgrounding job applicants has become increasingly complex.
While most U.S. employers conduct background screening, according to trade group data, those inquiries typically focus on criminal history. Social media receives far less attention even though that is where people are most likely to share their unguarded thoughts.
Undertaking a full review of a person’s social media presence is more difficult than just checking an applicant’s Facebook page.
Does an applicant have an account on X, formerly Twitter? How about an account with Discord, an online platform frequented by gamers, where leaked Pentagon documents were recently shared? Or what about a Telegram account, a messaging platform popular among white nationalists? Further complicating things, it’s common on sites like Reddit for users to adopt usernames and describe experiences with little to no ties to reality.
A little digging, however, can turn up a lot of dirt.  
Tokosh has a LinkedIn page that includes his teaching stints at Northern Illinois University and Nicholls State University. His time as a student and instructor at Kent State is absent.
For LinkedIn, a custom URL includes a play on his name and his chosen field of study: Joeography. Tokosh would later use that moniker in promotional materials for a class at Nicholls State. That is the same handle used on Reddit by someone with a special interest in face paint.
One post features a video of Tokosh throwing a pie at someone. Other posts mention a “clown fetish.” In a forum titled “Creepy,” he wrote, “I convince pretty girls to let me paint their faces,” along with a photo with multiple women in white face paint.
That and other similar posts remained live for years until they were taken down after the Nicholls students published their story in late March.
USA TODAY Network reporters captured screenshots before they disappeared. With dates in 2019, the posts feature a young woman wearing a Kent State T-shirt. The material would have been available to administrators at Northern Illinois before the start of the fall 2019 semester.
Joe King, a spokesman for Northern Illinois, said departments hiring new graduate students are “not required to check social media or investigate a disciplinary history.” He added some departments may reach out to the graduate students’ former advisers.
King said he could not determine if the university was aware of Tokosh’s behavior at Kent State. He said that due to FERPA, he could not share specifics about Tokosh’s time at Northern Illinois, including whether students had complained about him.
But there are signs the behavior continued.
A YouTube account under the name “Joe Tokosh” included at least two videos in 2020 of a man throwing pies at women. One of the videos features a young woman also seen in the screenshots from Tokosh’s Reddit account. 
Comments on one from October 2020 read: “You can have a video of her tied up getting pied via cash app.” That video was viewed more than 30,000 times before it was turned off in late July, around the time a USA TODAY reporter reached out to Tokosh.
A former Northern Illinois State student shared text messages exchanged with Tokosh in which he asked to paint her face on multiple occasions. USA TODAY has agreed not to name her because she is concerned Tokosh might retaliate against her.
In the text messages, Tokosh shared a photo of a young woman in white face paint – an image also posted to the Joeography Reddit account. She said she declined to do it but was aware that other Northern Illinois students had participated.
By fall 2022, when he had moved on to Nicholls, Tokosh revealed to the student that he had required students in his cultural geography class to paint their faces.  
The Northern Illinois student asked Tokosh what he did with the photos, and she said he suggested that he might spin them off into a research project someday. She asked, had anyone complained? She said Tokosh responded: Why would they?
Many students would find a reason to complain, as Nicholls State student journalist Sally-Anne Torres learned firsthand. It started in January when one of her fellow reporters picked up an odd rumor: a professor was offering extra credit for students willing to paint their faces like clowns. Initially, Torres dismissed it because it seemed too unusual and there weren’t a lot of leads to follow. 
By Feb. 7, university administrators informed Tokosh that his contract would not be renewed, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY via a records request. They gave no reason for the nonrenewal, but on Feb. 12, Tokosh emailed his students that the university was letting him go. He blamed his departure on giving too many A’s.
That seemed suspicious to Torres. 
During her reporting, she received a tip about Tokosh’s Reddit posts in which he wrote of his “clown fetish” and how he enlisted his students to participate in it.
“It wasn’t just this innocent thing that a lot of these girls thought it was,” Torres said. “As a professor or teacher, that is somebody students are supposed to trust. He used his power to ruin that trust and to do these things, and that made me angry for them.”
Torres spoke to six students who shared their experiences with Tokosh. Some, she said, were followed on Twitter by him while others opted into an extra credit assignment he offered.
The women told Torres he sometimes giggled and laughed as they painted their faces in his office.
On March 27, the Nicholls Worth published a story headlined, “Geography professor suspended immediately, students allege sexual harassment.” KNSU TV, a student broadcast network, also aired footage in which Tokosh defended the assignment on camera. That same day, Tokosh submitted his resignation.
The story’s publication prompted other students to come forward about Tokosh and their frustration with the university.
Bradley Price took an online class with Tokosh and said the professor required students to photograph themselves with their faces painted. Price said Tokosh told them the assignment was to help them understand Japanese culture, but then Tokosh offered him bonus points if he could get a female friend to paint her face.
It seemed unusual at the time, Price said, because his friend wasn’t in the class. It became more concerning to him on reading the student newspaper’s report.
“I feel frankly disgusted and disappointed that Nicholls couldn’t do a proper background check on this professor, because this is unacceptable,” Price said. 
Bella Ramos, a junior at Nicholls State who did not take any of Tokosh’s classes, told USA TODAY that someone using the handle @Joeography21 followed her on Twitter in late 2021 and started liking all her selfies.
Ramos learned that the person behind the account was likely a professor at the university. She posted about the behavior in January 2022, but nothing came of it. She also found the Joeography Reddit account. On March 27, the same day the student newspaper published its piece, Ramos posted screenshots of her discoveries on Twitter with the message, “Found a Nicholls state university professor on Reddit.”
“I wish the university had acted sooner because all this information was public on the internet,” she told USA TODAY. 
No one from the university, she said, has ever reached out.

President Joe Biden argued in an Oval Office address that U.S. leadership abroad and congressional aid to Israel and Ukraine is essential. Also in the news: Jim Jordan is giving it a third go at becoming House speaker on Friday and Hollywood film and TV actors near their 100th day of strike.
🙋🏼‍♀️ I'm Nicole Fallert, Daily Briefing author. Is Wi-Fi on the school bus for ... doing homework ... or watching TikToks?
Now here we go with Friday's news.
The president has made his case for the U.S. backing Israel and Ukraine in their respective wars with Hamas and Russia.
In an address to the public Thursday night, Biden sought to drive home the value of continued U.S. support for the close allies to a war-weary public less than a day after his visit Israel to meet with the country's prime minister. 
Here's more from USA TODAY on the Israel and Hamas war. You can sign up for our weekday briefing on the conflict here:
Lawmakers looked like they were coming close to a deal after Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, backed a plan empowering Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., as speaker until January to get the House moving again. McHenry has already been serving as an interim speaker with limited powers, and Jordan has lost two speaker elections on the House floor. But after an hours-long, closed-door meeting, House Republicans appeared to reject the plan, putting the lower chamber − and the nation − back at square one. But Jordan vowed not to give up his bid for the speakership. Read more

A second co-defendant with Donald Trump in the Georgia election conspiracy case, Sidney Powell, pleaded guilty Thursday to a half-dozen misdemeanors dealing with a conspiracy to interfere in the 2020 election. Powell, an election lawyer who baselessly claimed widespread election fraud in 2020, had been charged with racketeering and six other counts as part of a wide-ranging scheme to overturn the election so Trump could remain in power. Powell is the second co-defendant to plead guilty in the case, after Scott Hall.

There is no end in sight for film and TV actors who are striking in what has become the longest work stoppage in the industry's history. The strike by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists hits its 100th day on Saturday, while writers are busy back at work after ending their strike.  Negotiations unraveled earlier this month, when studios said discrepancies with actors' demands were too significant to find common ground. The actors union decried their opponents’ “bullying tactics” and said they were wildly mischaracterizing their offers. The prolonged strike means films and TV shows will remain sidelined indefinitely, as buzzy films like "Killers of the Flower Moon" hit theaters. Read more
Ready or not, winter is coming − but how bad is it going to be? Federal forecasters from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center gave us their answer Thursday in an annual winter outlook. NOAA said the U.S. winter of 2023-24 will probably be dominated by the effects of what could be a powerful El Niño. That means a mild, dry winter is likely on tap for much of the northern tier of the U.S., while the southeastern U.S. should see a wetter-than-average winter. Read more
The Rolling Stone's latest album, “Hackney Diamonds,” their first new material since 2005’s “A Bigger Bang,” arrived Friday. Hours before the clock struck midnight,  the legendary rock band rooted by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards roared through a seven-song set that blurred the lines between vintage and fresh – featuring a kinetic Lady Gaga as a surprise guest.

Associated Press contributed reporting.
Six weeks before Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel, a deputy political advisor in the group did an interview with a Lebanese news outlet. Tucked into it was a specific warning.  
“We are preparing for an all-out war,” Saleh al-Arouri said of Hamas. “We are closely discussing the prospects of this war with all relevant parties.” 
At the time, his statements were couched as a caution. Israel had plans including targeted killings of leaders of the Palestinian resistance group that controls Gaza, he said. If it followed through, Arouri warned, “a regional war” would ensue.  
Those Israeli provocations never happened. Yet by mid-October, an all-out war was under way. Hamas led a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,300 people including more than 30 Americans and taking at least 200 hostages, and a mounting response from Israel now brings more bloodshed.   
Already, Israel has struck a range of targets, and by mid-week announced at least six key Hamas operatives had been “eliminated.” 
But Israeli authorities also have launched an international manhunt for another Hamas leader, USA TODAY has learned: Saleh al-Arouri.  
They’re pursuing him not just for his insider knowledge of the attack, but for his ties to others – possibly those “relevant parties” he cited in August.  
The attack went far beyond what was expected from Hamas alone: A mass border invasion. Drones and paragliders. Withering rocket fire. Precise raids on military surveillance, communications and intelligence hubs. Those plans bear the hallmarks of sophisticated backers from the outside.  
Current and former intelligence officials say Arouri sits at a strategic intersection of three entities: Hamas; Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based terrorist group that is considered the world’s most formidable; and Iran, the world’s deadliest state sponsor of terrorism. 
If Iran and Hezbollah were involved in the Oct. 7 attack – as security authorities now suspect – someone from Hamas coordinated their assistance. And current and former U.S. and Israeli intelligence officials, and a USA TODAY review of government documents and court records, all point to Arouri as a key link.  
"Today most of the money that is going to Hamas is coming from Iran, and with the money comes the influence too," said Ehud “Udi” Levy, who served for more than 30 years in Israeli intelligence, including as head of the Mossad’s Economic Warfare Division that goes after terrorists' money. "And the Iran man inside Hamas is Saleh al-Arouri." 
More:Is Iran behind Hamas terrorist attacks? What it would mean for US and Middle East security
While experts said they do not yet know what specific role Arouri might have played on Oct. 7, they see him at the heart of a changing − and alarming − dynamic in which these three U.S.-designated terrorist entities are teaming up and further destabilizing the Middle East under the direction of Tehran.  
“With him, I cannot go into details about the involvement,” Danny Danon, an Israeli lawmaker who sits on the Knesset foreign affairs committee, told USA TODAY this week when asked about Arouri. “But I can tell you that Iran is heavily involved with everything that's happening in Gaza – the training, equipment, funding and method of fighting,”  
“We have knowledge of collaboration between Tehran, Beirut and Gaza,” said Danon, who was also Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations. “We are worried that the technology came from Tehran to Beirut and to Gaza.”
And Arouri, he said, “was heavily involved in that triangle.” 
Arouri was a founding commander of the the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas that carried out the attacks.  
Despite having spent years under U.S. terror sanctions, and with a $5 million State Department bounty on his head, he has traveled the region, including in and out of Iran, and collaborated with terrorist figures including the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Qasem Soleimani, before he was killed by a U.S. airstrike. 
And Arouri helped build and lead a new Hamas coalition with Iran and Hezbollah that so alarmed Israel, it sought emergency help from the United Nations Security Council in 2017 and again in 2018 to stop him.  
Arouri is based in Lebanon, where numerous media reports say Hamas leaders met with top Iranian and Hezbollah officials as recently as April. Now, he’s a prime target as Israel seeks out the strategists behind Oct. 7. 
But even after being watched by international authorities for decades, Arouri might not be easy to catch or kill. 
“They are looking for him like the Americans were looking for Bin Laden" after Sept. 11, Levy said. "He is a shadow guy. He is under the radar. And believe me, these are the dangerous people, people like that." 
Publicly, Israel is pointing the finger at more well-known Hamas figures based in Gaza, including Yahya Sinwar and military chief Mohammed Deif. 
“Yahya Sinwar, the ruler of the Gaza Strip, decided on this horrible attack, and therefore he — and the entire hierarchy under him — are dead men," Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said Oct. 12 in his first public statement since the war began. “We will attack them, we will dismantle them, dismantle their system.” 
Arouri lacks the same profile. One of his current titles is deputy chief of Hamas’ political bureau, but sources say Arouri’s role in Hamas has become much more prominent than that. In addition to still playing a role in the Qassam Brigades, Arouri has spent years helping rebuild Hamas operations in the other Palestinian territory blockaded by Israel, the West Bank, according to former Israeli and U.S. counterterrorism officials who have tracked him.  
And, they say, he acts as a chief deputy of sorts to Ismail Haniyeh, one of several Hamas leaders based in Qatar as they try to do political outreach for the group, including to Iran and Hezbollah. 
Five days after the attacks, Arouri offered Al Jazeera Arabic some of the first inside details about the operation, including how 1,200 members of the Qassam Brigades had been given “detailed instructions” about their targets, the Israeli military’s Gaza Brigade, just across the border from the Gaza Strip. 
“We were surprised that the Gaza Brigade collapsed in less than three hours, faster than we expected,” Arouri said.  
Officially, Iran has denied playing a role in the attack even as it congratulates Hamas. President Joe Biden told 60 Minutes on Oct. 15 that there’s no evidence “at this point” that Iran was behind the attack. Israeli officials have made similar comments, stressing that the investigation is in its early stages. 
But U.S. and Israeli intelligence analysts say that if anyone could give the group the ability to launch such stunning land, air and sea attacks against the Israeli military, it would be Iran and its Revolutionary Guard. Even as the hunt for Arouri continued this week, Iran and Hezbollah both raised prospects of openly entering the conflict to respond to Israel’s strikes at Gaza. 
Arouri’s role as an alliance-builder among terrorist organizations has been known to Israel since at least 2018. And his role in raising money and plotting terrorist attacks for Hamas has been known to both governments for a generation.
“It's not just the guys who pulled the trigger or approved the battle plan or gave the final order to do it but the people who are directing all of the strategy and really promoting the (anti-Israel) militarism,” said former FBI counterterrorism analyst and U.S. Treasury terror finance official Matthew Levitt. “And that's Saleh al-Arouri.” 
Yet he has evaded authorities for years.  
“He knows that if he steps anywhere close, we will kill him,” a former top Israeli intelligence official until earlier this year told USA TODAY. "He was on the run. You can imagine that there were several plans regarding that, but it just didn't happen.”  
Born in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Arouri became a fixture in pro-Palestinian activity in the mid-1980s at Hebron University, where he studied Sharia, or Islamic law. 
Security officials in Israel and the U.S. say Arouri joined Hamas soon after it was formed in late 1987 at the beginning of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising. He quickly graduated from being a leader of its on-campus youth organization to founding the Qassam Brigades in the name of establishing an Islamic Palestinian state in place of Israel. 
By the early 1990s, the Qassam Brigades began conducting anti-Israel attacks in the Palestinian territories and in Israel, U.S. and Israeli documents and interviews show. Those included large-scale bombings and rocket attacks, according to the U.S. Directorate of National Intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center, which it oversees.  
In 2003, the Justice Department named Arouri as an unindicted co-conspirator in a racketeering case against three Hamas operatives in Chicago who were charged with financing terrorism. In the indictment, Arouri was described as a high-ranking Hamas military leader who had received tens of thousands of dollars for terrorist activities including buying weapons.  
But Arouri was being investigated by the U.S. even before then.  
“The U.S. government has been aware of Arouri since the late 1990s when he was senior activist in the West Bank,” said Levitt, who worked at the FBI from 1998 to 2001. 
Israeli authorities detained and incarcerated Arouri three times, though he continued his Hamas activity even while in an Israeli prison in Ashkelon, the Justice Department indictment alleged. 
Arouri was arrested again in 2007 but freed in 2011 when Israel released more than 1,000 prisoners in exchange for an Israeli soldier who had been captured by Hamas in 2006.  
All told, Arouri ultimately spent about 15 years in Israeli prisons, Levy, Levitt and others say.  
Upon his final release, he was forced out of Gaza for being a continuing threat to Israel and moved to the Syrian capital of Damascus to join Hamas leadership in exile there.   
With the outbreak of civil war in Syria, Arouri was on the move again. He spent time in Turkey, where he began building an operational Hamas presence, in Qatar, where Hamas’ political leadership resided, and Lebanon. 
In 2014, Arouri announced that Hamas was responsible for a June 2014 terrorist attack that included the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, one of which was dual U.S.-Israeli citizen Naftali Fraenkel, the State Department said. He publicly praised the murders, which sparked Hamas’ month-long war with Israel that year, as a “heroic operation,” State Department documents show. 
With his alleged involvement of the murder of a U.S. citizen, Arouri was high on the U.S. government’s list of terror targets. 
In September 2015, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned him as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, saying he served as “a key financier and financial facilitator for Hamas military cells.”  
U.S. documents in support of that action say Arouri directed Hamas’ military operations in the West Bank, and that he had been linked to several terrorist attacks, hijackings, and kidnappings. 
In June 2017, Qatar expelled six Hamas members, including Arouri, the State Department said in its annual Country Reports on Terrorism. The move came amid intense pressure on Qatar by Washington to crack down on its longstanding role in providing safe haven for terrorists. 
Two months later, Arouri was instrumental in patching up relations between Hamas and Tehran.  
Iran’s history of providing money, weapons, training and technological support to Hamas actually goes back to the early 1990s, said Jonathan Schanzer, a former Treasury Department terror finance analyst and author of four books on Middle East politics.  
Arouri “put to rest” a feud with Iran over the civil war in Syria and began to forge closer links with Hezbollah from his new base of operations in Lebanon, said Schanzer. 
In November 2018, the U.S. State Department’s Rewards for Justice program offered up to a $5 million bounty for information on Arouri.  
At the time, the State Department said, Arouri was “currently living freely in Lebanon, where he reportedly is working with Qasem Soleimani, leader of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force.” 
Israel was so alarmed by these developments that Danon, as its ambassador to the United Nations, sent two urgent requests for intervention, the first in 2017, to the president of the UN Security Council.  
“The increasing cooperation between Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran constitutes a major threat not only to Israel but to the stability and security of the entire region,” Danon wrote in his May 11, 2018 follow-up letter, a copy of which was obtained by USA TODAY.  
The new alliance, including meetings of top operatives and pledges of mutual support, Danon wrote, was being led by Arouri and Saeed Izadi, head of the Palestinian Branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force.  
Hamas also was building its own military force covertly in Lebanon, Danon wrote, warning that it by then had built the infrastructure it needed to manufacture its own missiles and drones. 
In the recent past, one of Arouri’s jobs has been to bring Hamas fighters from the Qassam Brigades to Lebanon for specialized training, Danon said in an interview this week.  
Arouri now travels to and from Iran but mostly stays in Lebanon, where Hezbollah’s power as a political and military force provide him with protection, former security officials told USA TODAY.  
Asked if Israel knows his current whereabouts, Danon said: “I cannot comment on that.”  
On Oct. 7, the kind of weaponry Danon warned about – including drones – figured in the sophisticated Hamas attack, launched from Gaza. As Hamas forces raided Israeli towns, one of their first targets was the coastal city of Ashkelon, where Arouri had spent so many years in jail.   
In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, the FBI and other U.S. agencies have joined Israel in its response – and its investigation, according to Attorney General Merrick Garland and other Biden administration officials. 
That includes the hunt for at least 13 Americans who may be still held hostage by Hamas, the dragnet for Hamas foot soldiers believed to be hiding inside Israel and the broader investigation into who orchestrated and led the sophisticated invasion, two U.S. intelligence officials told USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing investigations. 
If the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S. are any guide, it could be months or even years before authorities answer those questions in detail.  
Iran has signaled a more aggressive approach to Israel, including a warning this week about potential Iranian action against Israel for its response in Gaza. Hezbollah has issued similar warnings. 
Iran’s suspected involvement in the planning of the Gaza raid has been widely reported. Gen. Esmail Ghaani, who is in charge of supervising Iran’s network of proxy militias as head of the country’s paramilitary Quds Force, repeatedly traveled to Lebanon for covert sessions with leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, the New York Times reported from the region.  
Iran also has supported Hamas militarily, it said, “and has helped it design and produce a domestic missile and rocket system to match the capabilities and material available in Gaza.”  
And Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah “held an hourslong online meeting in March with an elite group of strategists from all the Iran-backed militias and told them to get ready for a war with Israel with a scope and reach — including a ground invasion — that would mark a new era,” the Times reported, citing two participants from Iran and Syria.  
But media coverage has not yet focused on Arouri’s role in those relationships.  
Neither did senior Trump administration Iran official Richard Goldberg when he mentioned the existence of a Lebanon-based intelligence center for the three groups during a public event Monday.
Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah, Goldberg said, “have coordinated a fusion cell in Beirut since 2021 where they put everybody together in a war room, an intel room operations room, they go in and out of Lebanon… and they coordinated it all.” 
The former top Israeli security official confirmed to USA TODAY the existence of the joint Iran-Hezbollah-Hamas intelligence center in Beirut.
“They have representatives there, they coordinate their actions, they share information, they share intel. The purpose of that, of course, is to enhance their joint capabilities,” the former official, who left Israeli government earlier this year, said in an interview.
Asked if Arouri played a role in the center, the official said, “Yes of course. I'm not sure if he is the person that is representing (Hamas) there but clearly he has participated in joint meetings over there.”
Goldberg, the Director for Countering Iranian Weapons of Mass Destruction for the White House National Security Council from 2019 to 2020, said he believed the strong cooperation between Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah helped them keep the plot away from Israeli intelligence, just like al-Qaeda kept the 9/11 plot away from the U.S. 
“And so if you don't have any intel on the planning of the attack, it stands to reason you have no intel on Iran's involvement in said attack plans,” Goldberg said. “Of course you don't have the intel. You’re not going to find the intel. There was no intel (because) there was a catastrophic intelligence failure.” 
Rep. Brad Schneider (D-IL), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also said all signs point to Iran, given its role in funding, training and equipping Hamas fighters. 
“If you breed an attack dog, you train an attack dog, you equip an attack dog, maybe you're surprised that the dog breaks through the fence and attacks, but you're still responsible for that attack,” Schneider said. “And Iran has been training Hamas, has been equipping Hamas, funding Hamas, and this has the fingerprints of (Iran) training and planning all the way through.” 
The hunt for Arouri may reveal more of those plans, but for now, he appears only in his media statements.  
Speaking to Al Jazeera, just after the attack, he described his view of the Israeli response to come. 
"The occupation knows that its invasion of Gaza will turn the battle into a catastrophe for its army,” he said, according to a Palestine Chronicle translation. “Before our operation began, the defensive plan was ready, and it is much stronger than the offensive plan. ... We do not see a future for this battle except victory." 
EXETER, N.H. — Many candidates in the Republican presidential field are calling for a new generation of leaders in Washington. Former Vice President Mike Pence isn’t one of them.  
“It’s not a time for on-the-job training,” he told a crowd of New Hampshire voters at a town hall sponsored by the USA TODAY Network last week, repeating an argument he’s made time and again on the 2024 campaign trail.
“I’m running for president because, and I do say this with all humility, I’m the most qualified, tested and ready conservative seeking the Republican nomination”  
Pence has pitched a more traditional brand of conservatism than other candidates in the race that's focused on Republican values, fiscal responsibility and a strong U.S. military presence. Once deputy to former President Donald Trump, Pence also has offered strong rebukes of his ex-running mate's populist style, arguing it is "unmoored to conservative principles.”
But that argument doesn’t appear to be resonating with voters in the Granite State, or across the country. A recent Suffolk University survey, conducted in partnership with The Boston Globe and USA TODAY, showed Pence at just 1% in New Hampshire.
At the national level, Pence is doing slightly better. A Morning Consult survey on the race, fielded between Oct. 13 and 15, showed Pence at 6% – over 40 points behind Trump. He's also trailing GOP contenders like former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.
So, how is Pence attempting to win over voters? Here’s a look at the priorities he outlined in New Hampshire that would impact Americans coast to coast if the former vice president is elected to the White House.  
When it comes to balancing the federal budget and reducing the national debt, Pence has called for reforming mandatory spending programs like Social Security and Medicare – at least for some Americans.  
“I’d say to everybody that’s got hair the same color as me, this doesn’t affect you ... we’re not going to make changes to the deal,” the one-time talk radio host told voters in New Hampshire. 
For Americans under age 40, however, Pence said he would opt to privatize Social Security by allowing young workers to invest their payroll taxes into savings accounts. He insisted that the plan would give American workers twice what they earn from Social Security.  
The idea has been floated before by members of the Republican Party, most prominently during former President George W. Bush's administration. But it has never garnered enough support in Congress to become a reality for Americans.  
As the war between Israel and Hamas rages on, Pence in New Hampshire pledged to unequivocally support Israel, calling the country “our most cherished ally.” 
“We’ll make it clear to Hezbollah and Lebanon, to Iran and any other powers in the region, that everybody needs to stand down,” Pence said. “We’re going to defend Israel.”  
During the Trump administration, Pence helped negotiate the Abraham Accords, a bilateral agreement signed by Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in 2020 to normalize relations. However, at the town hall, Pence noted that facilitating further peace talks likely wouldn’t be a priority under his administration, given the ongoing war.  
“It feels to me like real progress is going to have to take a second chair to Israel doing what it needs to do,” he said.  
Pence offered similarly strong words on other issues of U.S. national security, including ongoing efforts to bolster Ukraine in its war against Russia.
When asked about his views on allocating U.S. taxpayer dollars to aid foreign conflicts, he argued that it’s among the most powerful ways America can stave off future aggression by countries like China.  
“China has made no secret of the fact that they would like to grab Taiwan,” Pence said. The Chinese government views the East Asian island as an extension of its territory and in recent years has ramped up military activity around its shores.  
Describing the growing superpower as “the greatest economic and strategic threat facing the U.S.,” Pence told New Hampshire voters that, as president, he would push to implement tariffs on Chinese goods and expand U.S. military presence in the South China Sea to defend American interests in the region. 
“The way we deal with China is not by diminishing our commitment to the Asia-Pacific. It’s by increasing our commitment,” Pence argued. A strong defense strategy would pave the way toward “a peaceful future with China and progress for the Chinese people,” he said.  
EL PASO, Texas — Democrats in Texas and New Mexico joined forces this week to denounce the concertina wire installed along the Texas-New Mexico border as part of Gov. Greg Abbott's ongoing Operation Lone Star to limit crossings.
Coils of razor wire were recently installed along the Rio Grande near Sunland Park, New Mexico, which neighbors El Paso. Abbott said migrants were bypassing miles of wire and fencing along the Texas side of the Rio Grande by moving west.
"Migrants are entering New Mexico illegally then crossing into Texas," he said earlier this month on X, formerly known as Twitter. "We are stopping it."
The Texas Military Department said the newly installed razor wired north of Downtown El Paso across from New Mexico's Sunland Park builds in the 18 miles of concertina wire the National Guard has laid on El Paso's border with Mexico.
"We are now fortifying the border between Texas and New Mexico to block migrants," the Texas Military Department said in an unsigned statement.
'Recipe for death:'Migrant deaths more than doubled in El Paso Sector after scorching heat
In a joint statement released Tuesday, Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa and Democratic Party of New Mexico Chair Jessica Velasquez blasted Abbott's move as a "stunt funded by the working Texas family's tax dollar that will result in environmental damage, community division and injuries of vulnerable migrants."
"It's clear that Gov. Abbott has no plans on actually addressing our broken immigration system head on," Hinojosa and Velasquez wrote in the statement, "but instead adding more fuel to Operation Lone Star's dumpster fire."
The concertina wire strung along the Texas-New Mexico border is the latest in a string of efforts made by Abbott to stem border crossings by record numbers of asylum-seekers entering the U.S. Since August, authorities have encountered more than 2.2 million migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the latest Customs and Border Protection (CBP) statistics.
What began as razor-wire along the Rio Grande and morphed into a floating barricade in the middle of the river has now transformed into an interstate conflict.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In their statement, the state party chairs praised New Mexico as having "some of the most humane, people-oriented immigration laws in the country."
"New Mexico Democratic leaders believe that everyone who comes to our country in pursuit of a better life, as an asylum-seeker or otherwise, deserves just and humane treatment, and the laws of New Mexico reflect those values," the statement read. "Greg Abbott knows that our neighbors in New Mexico are not the enemy but is working overtime to gain Fox News airtime to cover up his proposed legislation to implement unpopular school voucher scams, imprison vulnerable migrants and their families, and his own party's public infighting."
Abbott told a conservative audience during a trip to New York City late last month that migrants were bypassing the miles of razor wire along the Texas side of the Rio Grande near El Paso.
'New normal':High number of migrants crossing border not likely to slow
"Not only are we building a border of barriers between the border of Texas and Mexico," Abbott said during a Sept. 27 appearance sponsored by the Manhattan Institute. "We're also having now to build border barriers between Texas and New Mexico."
Texas and New Mexico Democratic party leaders asserted in their joint letter that both Republicans and Democrats acknowledge that "harmful border stunts" serve only to make the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border even more dire and called on Abbott to remove the barrier.
"Shame on Greg Abbott for using public tax dollars to uplift his dangerous approach to border security and infringing upon Texans' and New Mexicans' right to move freely across state lines," the statement read. "Texas and New Mexico Democrats condemn Abbott's razor wire fencing along our state borders and call for its removal effective immediately."
In August, there were 232,972 migrant encounters, either arrests or detainments, at the southern border, the most since December 2002, according to Customs and Border Protection.
Customs and Border Protection officials said migrants without any legal basis to stay will be processed for removal and face consequences that include a minimum five-year bar on re-entry, loss of eligibility to access lawful pathways, and prosecution for repeat offenders.
But for many migrants, who travel hundreds, if not thousands of miles, many with their families, to get to the U.S., they may think it's worth the risk, said Victor Manjarrez, a former Border Patrol chief in the El Paso sector and the director of the Center for Law and Human Behavior at the University of Texas at El Paso.
Adam Isacson, director of defense oversight for Washington on Latin America (WOLA), a nonprofit advocacy organization, said while there may be a lot of policies migrants have to contend with, many of them might assume it can't be as bad as what they've endured to get to the U.S.
"When you compare risking your life going through a jungle, a desert, or the Rio Grande to escape living in a dangerous slum in Caracas (Venezuela)," Isacson said. "Compared to that kind of life, they probably think there's no level of misery that these policies can impose that is worse than what they are fleeing from."

SeaWorld Orlando recently welcomed three smalltooth sawfish pups becoming the only aquarium in the U.S. to showcase the marine animals and the second worldwide to have a successful birth, the aquarium said Wednesday.
The pups, born on July 11, 2023, include two females and one male, SeaWorld Orlando said in a press release. The marine animals that look like little sharks with their saw-shaped rostrums measured approximately two feet in length.
SeaWorld said that the pups underwent a comprehensive examination after their birth and continue to receive regular check-ups to "ensure their sustained health and expected developmental progress". The check-ups are essential for saving these critically endangered species from extinction.
Smalltooth sawfish are categorized as ray, despite their shark-like bodies, showcasing gills and mouths on their undersides, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Fisheries states. The marine creatures get their name from their distinct rostrum - a long, flat snout edged with teeth - that looks like a saw. They are usually olive gray to brown on top and have a white underside.
Sawfishes belong to a group of fish called elasmobranchs that include rays, skates and sharks. Elasmobranchs have no bones. Their skeletons are instead made of cartilage.
The pups are born fully developed at a length of approximately 2 feet, with their sawfish teeth covered by a thick material that dissolves within a few days/weeks. This adaptation protects both the mother and other siblings while in utero.
Smalltooth sawfish typically live in tropical seas and estuaries of the Atlantic Ocean, the NOAA states, preferring shallow, coastal waters. In the U.S., they can be found in Florida’s coastal waters.

Two adult smalltooth sawfish have lived at SeaWorld Orlando since the 1980s. The duo currently resides in the 700,000-gallon Shark Encounter main habitat and have the title of the largest fish in the park.
In late May, the marine center's veterinary teams discovered through ultrasound that the female sawfish was pregnant. Given the significance of this development, the female sawfish was relocated to the Aquarium Health Center so that she could be closely monitored through the birth of the pups.
The aquarium does not intend to put them the pups on display just yet. They will remain behind the scenes as they grow and develop under supervision.
Is the ivory-billed woodpecker officially extinct? Not yet, but these 21 animals are
Vice President of Zoological Operations at SeaWorld Orlando, Dr. Joseph Gaspard, hailed the birth of the pups as "a significant achievement" in a statement and said that it is a "privilege" to care for them.
Sawfish Recovery Coordinator for the NOAA, Adam Brame, called the births "historic."
"These young sawfish will provide a great opportunity for researchers and aquarists to learn more about juvenile growth and development," said Brame, in a statement. "But equally important, this will be a chance for the public to witness and develop an understanding of these majestic creatures. It is through these opportunities that greater conservation can be achieved."
The only species of sawfish to be found in U.S. water, smalltooth sawfish are critically endangered and were the first marine fish to be protected by the Endangered Species Act twenty years ago, following a significant decline in population from habitat loss and unintended capture by fishers.
Efforts are being made to protect these species from becoming extinct with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) developing the Sawfish Species Survival Plan to help facilitate the future reproductive success of these animals.
'Climate captives':Frogs, salamanders and toads dying rapidly as Earth warms, study says

An avid distance runner in Raleigh, North Carolina, diagnosed with a terminal neurodegenerative disease, decided to enter what she thought would be her last race. Instead, she ended up doing 50 more.
For years, Andrea Lytle Peet, 42, had competed in triathlons and even a half-Ironman. But in 2014, after noticing her times were slowing and her muscles weren't as strong as they used to be, she discovered she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
"In six months, I went from the strongest I've ever been to walking with a cane," said Peet. "I was shocked and sad in the moment, but I also realized that I had no more time to waste in this life."
Doctors told her the typical life expectancy for someone with ALS is two to five years. She decided she wanted to use her time and her body in a way that she loves.
"Neither of us really knew what the disease had in store," said David Peet, Andrea's husband and caregiver.
She bought a recumbent trike, sometimes used in races as an accessibility alternative, and competed in what she believed would be her last triathlon.
"I came in last by almost an hour, but people stayed to watch," she said. "This was really a profoundly moving experience."
It encouraged her to keep going. While her muscle movement was declining, she appeared to be defying the grim prognosis she'd been given. Before she knew it, Andrea had completed marathons in every state — the first person with ALS to do so. Her 50th one was in Alaska.
Watch the moment Andrea crosses the finish line in the video below after competing in 50 races.
Since then, Peet has written a memoir and been the subject of a documentary about her experience.
"I hope that it can be used to show people how to take on whatever marathon is in their lives, whether it's ALS, whether it's anything," said David.
Peet says she always feels better when she rides and can feel her muscles move, even though the disease gradually removes muscle control.
"The worst thing that happens to you, it doesn't define you unless you let it," said Peet. "If you just put one foot in front of the other, there's really no telling where you can end up."

President Joe Biden will give remarks from the Oval Office Thursday evening during primetime about the wars in Israel and Ukraine.
USA TODAY will be providing live coverage of Biden's address, which begins at 8 p.m. ET. You can watch at the video at the top of this page or on USA TODAY's YouTube channel.
Biden's remarks follow his trip to Israel this week, where he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pledged support in the Jewish state's war against Hamas and sought to prevent the war from expanding into a larger conflict.
Biden arrived as tensions were mounting after an explosion Tuesday at a Gaza City hospital that had been treating wounded Palestinians and sheltering many more who were seeking a refuge from the fighting.
The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza blamed an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military said the destruction was caused by a misfired Palestinian rocket. The blast prompted worldwide outrage and protests.
At the start of a meeting with Netanyahu, Biden said it did not appear that Israel was to blame.

Biden's Thursday address will also cover the ongoing war in Ukraine.
Last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a $200 million military aid package for Ukraine that includes ammunition for air defense and artillery ammuniton and anti-tank and -drone weapons. This weapons shipment is the latest since Russia invaded in February 2022, bringing total American military support to more than $40 billion.
U.S. Capitol Police said Thursday that they arrested more than 300 protesters who held a demonstration inside a U.S. House office building in Washington D.C., over the Israel-Hamas war.
Protesters with Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow were detained on Capitol Hill while calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, a narrow strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.
Police reported that the protest broke out at the Cannon House Office Building just before 1:40 p.m. Wednesday and shut down roads outside the building due to the demonstration.
Video shows demonstrators wearing black T-shirts reading "Jews Say Ceasefire Now" in white lettering shouting "Ceasefire now!" Other footage shows the group sitting on the Cannon Rotunda floor clapping in unison.
U.S. House and Senate office buildings are open to the public but protests are forbidden in congressional buildings.

Arrests took place in the Cannon Rotunda, police reported.
U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Paul Starks told USA TODAY on Thursday that police arrested 308 people on charges of crowding, obstructing, or incommoding in a forbidden area. They were ticketed and released.
Of those arrested, three people were also charged with assault of a police officer because, Starks said, they resisted arrest.
Starks said police were not aware of any major injuries.
The rotunda was cleared by 5 p.m., police said.
The war:As war in Israel, Gaza rages on, President Biden is having a moment
On Oct. 7, a major Jewish holiday, Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns. The attack, which killed hundreds of civilians, stunned Israel and caught its military and intelligence apparatus completely off guard.
Israel immediately launched airstrikes on Gaza, destroying entire neighborhoods and killing hundreds of Palestinian civilians in the days that have followed.
As of Thursday, the war's death toll surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides. At least 199 people, including children, were captured by Hamas and taken into Gaza, according to Israel.
The leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, said in a recorded message that the assault was in response to Israel's 16-year blockade of Gaza; Israeli raids inside West Bank cities over the past year, violence at at the Al-Aqsa Mosque − built on a contested Jerusalem holy site sacred to Jews as the Temple Mount; increased attacks by settlers on Palestinians; and the expansion of Jewish settlements on occupied lands Palestinians claim for a future state.
The Hamas incursion came on Simchat Torah, a normally joyous day when Jews complete the annual cycle of reading the Torah scroll. Israel declared war the next day.
Previous Israel-Hamas wars were in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021.

An explosion at a Greek Orthodox church in Gaza City late Thursday resulted in casualties and injuries along with displacing Palestinians who were taking refuge there. 
Mohammed Abu Selmia, director general of Shifa Hospital, told The Associated Press that dozens were wounded at the Church of Saint Porphyrios but could not give a precise death toll because bodies were still under the rubble. The Holy Orthodox Order of the Holy Great Martyr George confirmed the bombing, adding that more than 500 people were being housed at the church and monastery.
"The bombs hit the two church halls where the refugees, including children and babies, were sleeping. Presently, survivors are searching the rubble for other casualties," the order said in a statement Thursday. 
The blast comes after an explosion Tuesday that rocked the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, in whose compound many Palestinians had been seeking refuge from the persistent Israeli bombardment. According to a preliminary U.S. intelligence analysis, the death toll was on the "low end" of 100 to 300.
The incident triggered outrage across the Middle East, as Hamas and Israel blamed each other for the attack. Since the war began on Oct. 7, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said 3,785 Palestinians have been killed and more than 12,500 others have been wounded. And in Israel, more than 1,400 people have been killed.
Israel’s defense minister has told troops to be ready for a ground offensive in Gaza but he has not said when the assault will begin. In a televised address on Thursday, President Joe Biden urged people to support Ukraine and Israel, saying "American leadership is what holds the world together."

Developments:
∎ The Rafah crossing at the Egypt-Hamas border, which had been expected to open Friday to allow humanitarian aid to come in, probably won't be ready until later in the weekend because of road repairs and other concerns, CNN reported. The aid deal struck Wednesday had included a stipulation that roads essential to the flow of aid would first be fixed.
∎ Israeli Minister of Economy Nir Barkat told reporters the military, not political leaders, will decide when to invade Gaza. "The Israeli government made a decision, they green-lighted the army, 'Wipe them out,' and now it's in the hands of the army,'' he said.
∎ More than 100 retired U.S. generals have signed an open letter from the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs calling on President Joe Biden and Congress to give Israel all the support it needs militarily, diplomatically and logistically against the "Iran-backed terrorist threats that surround it on all sides."
∎ The U.S. is waiving travel visa requirements for Israelis earlier than expected.
∎ Hamas fighters likely fired North Korean weapons during their Oct. 7 assault on Israel, a video and weapons seized by Israel show, despite Pyongyang’s denials that it arms the militant group. South Korean officials, two experts on North Korean arms and an Associated Press analysis of weapons captured on the battlefield by Israel point toward Hamas using Pyongyang’s F-7 rocket-propelled grenade, a shoulder-fired weapon that fighters typically use against armored vehicles.
Gaza's dwindling water, electricity supply could turn hospitals into 'morgues'
No place was safe for more than 2 million Palestinians as Israeli bombs slammed the Gaza Strip, including parts of the Palestinian territory that Israel had declared “safe zones.”
At least 12 people were killed and dozens wounded when a residential building in the southern city of Khan Younis was struck, medical personnel at Nasser Hospital said. The intensified shelling came one day after Israel agreed to allow limited shipments of humanitarian aid into southern Gaza from Egypt.
“Israeli Air Forces continued to strike southern areas despite the directive for people in #Gaza to move south,” the UN Relief and Works Agency said. The agency said at least 14 of its own staff had been killed and nine more wounded − adding that the “actual number is likely to be much higher” − in less than two weeks since a stunning, bloody incursion of Hamas militants killed more than 1,000 Israeli citizens and fueled military reprisals from Israel.
The commander of the Hamas-led National Security Forces, Maj. Gen. Jihad Muheisen, was killed in an Israeli strike on his Gaza City home along with some relatives, Hamas said. Israel Defense Forces says it is attacking Hamas militants wherever they hide in Gaza and has accused the militants of taking shelter among the civilian population.
The death toll of Israelis and Palestinians surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five wars involving the narrow, densely populated strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.
The U.S. State Department on Thursday issued a "worldwide caution" for U.S. travelers. The travel advisory cites "increased tensions in various locations around the world, the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests."
The agency urges Americans overseas to exercise increased caution and stay alert in known tourist spots that might be attractive targets. It also suggests travelers sign up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive information and alerts − and to make it easier to locate someone in an emergency overseas.
A U.S. warship in the northern Red Sea shot down three missiles and several drones fired from Yemen, the Pentagon said Thursday, in the latest danger sign of how the Israel-Hamas war could expand into a regional conflict.
A Pentagon spokesman said the projectiles were launched by Iranian-backed Houthi militants, who have expressed support for the Palestinians and threatened Israel. Last week, their leader cautioned that they may fire missiles and drones if the U.S. intervened in the war.
A U.S. official told The Associated Press the missiles were likely not aimed at the USS Carney, the Navy destroyer that intercepted them over the water. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations that have not been made public.
“We cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen heading north along the Red Sea, potentially towards targets in Israel,” Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters.
Ryder said the Defense Department is still trying to ascertain the missiles' target, adding they were destroyed because their flight pattern indicated a possible threat. He said the U.S. is prepared to do whatever is required “to protect our partners and our interests in this important region.”
Houthi officials declined to comment.

The United Nations will inspect the trucks bringing in humanitarian aid from Egypt into Gaza and will help oversee the process, but the organization's head would prefer the desperately needed supplies could be carried in under a cease-fire.
The warring parties have not agreed to suspend hostilities, although a U.N. flag will fly over the Rafah crossing to dissuade Israeli airstrikes. The crossing has been expected to open Friday, but CNN reported that road repairs and other concerns will likely delay that till later in the weekend.
“Civilians in Gaza need core services and supplies, and for that we need rapid and immediate humanitarian access, we need water, food and medicine now,'' U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said. "We need it at scale, and we need it to be sustained.”
Israel agreed Wednesday to allow aid into Gaza after a request from Biden, but demanded the assistance not go through its territory, only via Egypt, and that it be kept away from Hamas. Israeli officials have said their siege of the Palestinian territory won't be lifted until Hamas releases the approximately 200 hostages it captured during its Oct. 7 rampage.
One unresolved issue is whether Israeli will allow fuel into Gaza, a particularly important matter at a time when several hospitals in the territory have closed for lack of diesel. Negotiations are ongoing.
As war in Israel, Gaza rages onAs war in Israel, Gaza rages on, President Biden is having a moment
A U.S. cargo plane arrived in Israel carrying the initial shipment of armored vehicles designated to replace vehicles damaged during the war, the Israel Ministry of Defense said Thursday. Armored ambulances, trucks and mechanical engineering equipment are expected to arrive in coming days, the ministry said.
The first delivery came the day after Biden's trip to Tel Aviv, where he pledged the U.S. would stand by Israel and provide whatever is needed to defend itself in its war with Hamas. Biden said he would seek congressional approval of an "unprecedented support package" to bolster Israel's defense.
He also pledged $100 million in U.S. funding for humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
More than a million people have fled their homes in the Gaza Strip ahead of an expected Israel invasion that seeks to eliminate Hamas’ leadership after its deadly assault. Aid groups warn an Israeli ground offensive could hasten a humanitarian crisis. About 300,000 Israelis have been internally displaced since the start of the war, the Times of Israel reports, citing Israel Democracy Institute research. Most are from southern Israel in the Gaza border towns where Hamas carried out its murderous rampage.
The president has made a sudden transformation from a political figure whose commitment to Israel was often questioned by conservative critics inside and outside the Jewish state to arguably the world's leading champion of Israel outside the Middle East. Biden's actions and words since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, capped by a dramatic visit to Israel on Wednesday, have been lauded even by many of Biden's biggest skeptics in Israel as he stands in solidarity with the country and pledges "unprecedented" military assistance.
"Israelis were hungry for a father figure that will hug them and show empathy. And the president has done that in such a way that really touched every Israeli," said Nimrod Novik, a former foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and now a fellow with the Israel Policy Forum.

Gaza hospital explosion:How a deadly blast near al-Ahli center unfolded
Palestinian Americans are seeing two fronts in the Israel-Hamas war: One is the bloodshed in the Middle East, the other is emotional backlash from bigotry and hate in the U.S.
A U.S. Department of Justice hate crime investigation into the fatal stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American Muslim boy in Illinois is one of several incidents of alleged hate being directed at Palestinian Americans, allies and people who look like them since the war began.
The community feels under siege, American Muslims for Palestine executive director Osama Abu Irshaid told USA TODAY, but at the same time wants to show support and express grief in the crisis.
“They’re not out there to threaten anyone," Irshaid said. "They’re not there to delegitimize another narrative. They’re out there to assert a narrative that is being diminished."

Battle against hate:Violence, bigotry toward Palestinian Americans spiking across U.S.
The Israel Defense Forces, also known as the IDF, is the national military of Israel. It has three branches: the army, navy and air force. It is a conscripted military service, meaning Israel mandates IDF service for Jewish, Druze and Circassian citizens over the age of 18, with some exceptions. It was established in 1948, two weeks after Israel became an independent country.
Before the war began, the IDF had 169,500 active troops and was the 28th largest military in the world by active personnel, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military Balance 2023. There were also 465,000 reserve personnel to supplement active military forces if deemed necessary.

More:Biden: Gaza to get aid by Friday; US says Israel not to blame for hospital blast. Live updates
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, and several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for the establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material, and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.

As usual, it’s a great day to not be former president and current criminal defendant Donald J. Trump.
Sidney Powell – his former legal adviser, fellow champion of the gargantuan and ongoing “rigged election” lie and co-defendant in the sweeping Georgia election interference case – pleaded guilty Thursday and agreed to testify against others involved in the alleged conspiracy.
The word “others” is important, as it may well include Trump, the far-and-away leading GOP presidential primary candidate who, one imagines, is presently hurling all available ketchup at the walls of his Mar-a-Lago pout room.
Powell was known among Trump fanatics and election conspiracy theorists as the person who would “release the Kraken” and unleash unassailable evidence the election was rigged, righteously returning Trump to the White House. In a Nov. 24, 2020, Fox Business interview with Lou Dobbs, Powell said of the election, "There's no way there was anything but widespread election fraud here."
She has now pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference of election duties and been sentenced to six years of probation.
She also has to pay some fines and write an apology letter to the people of Georgia, which is quite the thing when you consider the unbridled conviction with which she lied to the American public, often via Fox News appearances, about the 2020 presidential election being “stolen” from Trump.
Trump's Georgia arrest isn't an anomaly:Take a good look at Trump's booking photo, Republicans. That's your GOP.
Powell's unhinged conspiracies were featured prominently in Dominion Voting Systems successful lawsuit against Fox News, and she's facing her own $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit from the company as well.
It appears the Kraken may not be all she was cracked up to be. Worse yet for the MAGA crowd, said Kraken will now be released in Trump’s direction.
Duly flipped, Powell will undoubtedly help Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ case against other defendants like former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and the former president himself, as she was central to much of the hysterical lying and scheming that transpired after Joe Biden won the presidency fair and square.
In a Nov. 14, 2020, tweet, Trump hailed Powell as part of his “truly great team” of lawyers.
Powell was part of an election conspiracy news conference held at the Republican National Committee headquarters on Nov. 19, 2020, an event made famous largely because Giuliani was sweating so profusely that hair dye ran down the side of his face.
At the news conference, Powell said: “What we are really dealing with here and uncovering more by the day is the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China and the interference with our elections here in the United States.”
People with even a pinky toe still dipped in the pool of reality knew at the time that was nonsense, but it's clear from her guilty plea that Powell knew it was nonsense as well.
She went to meet with Trump at the White House on Dec. 18, 2020, and talked about declaring a national emergency and having the president order the military to seize certain voting machines.
How long until Trump breaks gag order?Trump, who never shuts up, now has a gag order to whine about. And you know he will.
It’s easy to write Powell off as a conspiratorial crackpot, but they were all conspiratorial crackpots, and she marched side by side with Giuliani and Trump.
So the Kraken pleading guilty does three significant things:
For all her zany nonsense – which was featured over and over on Fox News in the wake of the 2020 election, helping brainwash a sizable swath of the populace – Powell was sane enough to know when to save her own hide.
Asked by the judge Thursday whether she believes “there are enough facts that support this plea of guilty,” Powell responded: “I do.”
That’s one of the first honest things she has said in a long time. And it pulls the curtain all the way back on the scam Trump and his cronies have been running since the day he lost the 2020 election.

Ready or not, winter is coming − but how bad is it going to be? Federal forecasters from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center gave us their answer Thursday in an annual winter outlook.
NOAA said the U.S. winter of 2023-24 will probably be dominated by the effects of what could be a powerful El Niño. That means a mild, dry winter is likely on tap for much of the northern tier of the U.S., while the southeastern U.S. should see a wetter-than-average winter.
The center's forecast covers December, January and February, which is known as meteorological winter.
Warmer-than-average temperatures are favored across the northern tier of the U.S. and much of the far West, NOAA said. The greatest odds for warmer-than-average conditions are in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and northern New England. No parts of the nation are forecast to to be colder than average, according to the forecast.
As for precipitation, wetter-than-average conditions are most likely in northern Alaska, portions of the West from California to the south-central Rockies, the southern Plains, the Gulf Coast, the Southeast and the lower mid-Atlantic, NOAA predicts.
“An enhanced southern jet stream and associated moisture often present during strong El Niño events supports high odds for above-average precipitation for the Gulf Coast, lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast states this winter,” said Jon Gottschalck, of the Climate Prediction Center.
The wet conditions across the South should help ease the drought in the region: "El Niño, with its enhanced precipitation, is expected to provide drought relief to the southern U.S. during the next few months,” said the Climate Prediction Center's Brad Pugh.
As for where a dry winter is likely, the greatest odds for drier-than-average conditions are forecast in portions of the northern Rockies and central Great Lakes region, especially for Michigan and northern Ohio and Indiana.
The main factor federal climate scientists use to forecast winter weather is the strength of El Niño or La Niña, climate patterns that affect weather in the U.S. and around the world. The entire natural climate cycle is officially known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which swings between warmer and cooler seawater in the tropical Pacific Ocean.
(El Niño is unusually warm water in the tropical Pacific Ocean; La Niña means cooler-than-average water in the Pacific.)
This El Niño, which began in June, is predicted to last through the winter. It could be a "historically strong" one, the Climate Prediction Center said, potentially rivaling those in 2015-16 and 1997-98.
Let it snow?:Winter predictions start as El Niño strengthens. Here's what forecasters say.
The forecast released Thursday predicts only where above- or below-normal temperatures – and above- or below-normal precipitation – are most likely.
This winter forecast does not specify how much precipitation will fall as rain, snow or ice, only that more or less is likely overall. Snow forecasts depend upon the strength and track of winter storms, which generally cannot be predicted more than a week in advance, the center has said in the past.
As for the 50 million Americans who live in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, where big snowstorms typically bring the most angst, the climate center does not give a specific forecast for how much snow will fall.
How cold and snowy will US winter be?:Why October snow in Siberia could hold the answer.
Climate patterns such as the Arctic Oscillation – which can unleash intensely cold temperatures across the central and eastern U.S. – aren't included in this official forecast at this time because they can't be predicted more than one or two weeks in advance.
Other large-scale climate patterns in the atmosphere that can influence winter weather include the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can affect the number of heavy-rain events along the West Coast. It also can contribute to other extreme events in the U.S., including Arctic air outbreaks during the winter months across the central and eastern portions of the nation, the Climate Prediction Center says.
The forecast does also not factor in Siberian snow cover, which other forecasters use as the basis for their winter weather forecasts.
Since the Israeli military ordered civilians to flee Gaza as it pursues Hamas militants, more than 1 million Palestinians have left their homes in the face of mounting airstrikes.
Vehicles carrying relief supplies stood motionless at Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip this week while locals and aid organizations begged for food, water and fuel for generators. They said the tiny territory sealed off by Israel after last week’s rampage by Hamas was near total collapse.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who had been forced from their homes were searching for bread. Hospitals in Gaza were on the brink of power outages, endangering the lives of thousands of patients. As an Israeli ground invasion seemed a certainty, Hamas militants continued their relentless rocket fire, and tensions grew along the Israel-Lebanon border to the north.
The Gaza power plant and power cables from Israel, which were Gaza's two primary suppliers of electricity, are no longer operational. At the beginning of the siege, Israel cut off its supply of electricity to the city, and the power plant ceased operations almost a week ago because of a shortage of fuel.
Unable to view our graphics? Click here to see them. 
On Oct. 11, the Gaza Power Plant in Deir al-Balah, immediately south of the evacuation area, closed for lack of fuel. And with the suspension of Israeli supplies, Gaza is now without energy. 
Hospitals and other large facilities have backup generators, but when the fuel runs out, Israel's blockade will prevent new supplies from coming in.
Hospitals in Gaza "risk turning into morgues" without electricity, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The death toll on both sides has surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five wars involving the narrow, densely populated strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.

WASHINGTON — In the nation's 16th day without a speaker of the House, Republican lawmakers made seemingly no progress towards electing a new, permanent leader. 
Lawmakers looked like they were coming close to a deal after Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, backed a plan empowering Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., as speaker until January to get the House moving again. McHenry has already been serving as an interim speaker with limited powers, and Jordan has lost two speaker elections on the House floor.
But after an hours-long, closed-door meeting, House Republicans appeared to reject the plan, putting the lower chamber − and the nation − back at square one. But Jordan vowed not to give up his bid for the speakership.
As long as the House doesn't have a speaker, lawmakers can't approve crucial legislation, such as funding to avoid a government shutdown or aid to Israel as the country's war rages on with Hamas.
Catch up with USA TODAY's updates on the speaker fight.
The House will convene for a third speaker election at 10:00 a.m. Friday morning, Jim Jordan's office confirmed Thursday evening.
– Ken Tran
Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., told reporters that he and the other Republican holdouts who have refused to support Jim Jordan told the Ohio lawmaker on Thursday to withdraw his candidacy.
"He needed to know there's no way forward for a speakership," Rutherford said. "He missed his moment in leadership when he failed Steve Scalise. That was pretty much everybody's opinion."
Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise previously sought the speakership but withdrew his bid earlier this month.
– Ken Tran
Former Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., entered Jordan's office Thursday evening.
Part of the New York GOP delegation, a faction against Jordan, voted for Zeldin as a protest candidate in the last two speaker elections the Ohio Republican lost.– Ken Tran
Jordan left a meeting with a handful of the GOP holdouts against him and said they had a "good discussion."
But some of those Republican lawmakers who left the meeting room, including Reps Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. and Mike Kelly, R-Pa., said their minds have not changed. The meeting seems to have done little for Jordan's pursuit of the speakership.
– Ken Tran
Leaving the speaker's office, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the former speaker of the House, told reporters Jim Jordan should stay in the race and "fight through it."
"Don't give up right away," McCarthy said.
– Ken Tran
The major problem facing Jordan is that his opponents come from various corners of the House Republican conference, each with their own grievances against the Ohio Republican.
A portion of the New York GOP delegation for instance, are pressing Jordan for commitments to increase what's known as the SALT tax cap, a state and local tax deduction popular with their constituents back home.
Other lawmakers, such as Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a vulnerable and moderate GOP lawmaker,  are refusing to vote for Jordan out of frustration with how conservative hardliners seemingly have a stranglehold on the rest of the House Republicans.
Bacon has argued voting for Jordan would effectively be rewarding “bad behavior” from conservative hardliners, the people who fueled the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
Jordan is also facing opposition over his proposed government funding plan that could include a 1% cut across the board to government spending, which would include defense spending. Among those lawmakers is Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fla., chair of the House Appropriations Committee.
A large portion of the GOP holdouts against Jordan are currently meeting with the Ohio Republican, McCarthy and McHenry.
– Ken Tran
Jordan, leaving the an hours-long meeting with his fellow Republicans that resulted in no progress towards electing a new speaker, portrayed confidence in his bid, even as the holdouts against him show no interest in budging.
“We made the pitch to members on the resolution (to empower McHenry) as a way to lower the temperature and get back to work. We decided that wasn’t where we’re gonna go,” Jordan told reporters. “I’m still running for speaker and I plan to go to the floor and get the votes and win this race.”
Before heading to a possible third speaker election however, Jordan said he will consult his allies and meet with the holdouts and attempt to assuage their concerns “so that we can move forward and begin to work for the American people.”
– Ken Tran
A group of Republicans on Thursday afternoon appeared to balk at the idea of granting McHenry additional powers.
For example, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., chair of the House Republican conference, came out against the now-dead resolution to empower McHenry as an interim speaker.
"I strongly oppose any attempt to create a Democrat backed coalition government," Stefanik said in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Empowering McHenry almost certainly would have required Democratic support.
Stefanik is the No. 4 ranking House Republican and her opposition against the resolution is a likely indicator any further attempts to empower McHenry have a steep uphill climb.– Ken Tran
Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., told reporters Jim Jordan will consult his family and ousted former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy before a possible third speaker election Thursday.
-- Ken Tran
Exiting a closed-door meeting, Republican lawmakers said the resolution to empower McHenry will not go to the floor.
Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., told reporters he expects there to be a third speaker election Thursday, with Jordan as the GOP nominee again.
– Ken Tran
Speaking to reporters outside the closed-door meeting, McCarthy noted how following his ouster, there is no clear GOP leadership to handle key legislative issues, such as funding the government or passing a foreign aid package for Israel.
"Nobody's involved in this because that brilliant eight people led by Gaetz, this was apparently their plan," McCarthy said.
"I don't quite understand what that helps America for, what that helps the conservative cause because it's actually the reverse," he added.
– Ken Tran
Among one of the points of debate in the closed-door conference meeting is whether there is even need for a resolution to empower McHenry. McHenry already has powers to oversee legislation on the House floor, some House Republicans have argued.
Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., told USA TODAY he believes McHenry already has the "authority to move forward."
The acting speaker however, has been resistant to the idea, Molinaro said, instead pushing for Congress to pass a resolution instead to resolve the issue.
GOP lawmakers have been huddling for two and a half hours now and there is still no clear timeline for when the measure to empower McHenry would be considered
– Ken Tran
The efforts to empower McHenry have bitterly divided the House Republican conference to the point members might hold an internal vote to determine support.
Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, said members are questioning whether the measure is constitutional. An internal vote would effectively be a test to see where the conference stands on granting McHenry temporary powers.
"There's a desire to still vote on it so it's clarified there's no potential challenges," Crenshaw told reporters.
– Ken Tran
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told reporters House Republicans shouldn't expect Democrats to vote to empower McHenry without making some concessions.
"We're not just going to give our votes," Raskin said. The Maryland Democrat deferred to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on what those concessions might look like.
"Obviously, if our votes are needed, we're going to be substantively involved in the definition of what the agenda is," Raskin added.
– Ken Tran
Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., told reporters he expects half of the House Republican conference to oppose the measure granting McHenry temporary powers.
Zinke himself did not say whether he would support the resolution, noting he thinks the House should elect a speaker and reiterating his support for Jordan.
– Ken Tran
Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., left the door open to supporting a resolution to empower Patrick McHenry.
"We have to see the details" first, Moskowitz told reporters.
House Democrats, Moskowitz said, are biding their time and waiting to hear from Republicans on the proposal.
– Ken Tran
Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said House Democrats were keeping their powder dry on supporting a resolution to empower McHenry.
The resolution has sparked fury from a sizable portion of the House Republican conference, meaning Democrats will have to pitch in and support the measure.
McGovern, reacting to the infighting the resolution has caused, suggested for House Republicans to stop holding conference meetings and instead opt for "intense therapy."
– Ken Tran
Meanwhile, just a one-minute walk away from a closed-door meeting where House Republicans are debating a resolution to empower McHenry, House Democrats are huddling to discuss next steps.
The move to empower McHenry as a temporary speaker will almost certainly require a heavy lift from Democrats. Hard-right lawmakers have been leaving the GOP meeting furious and lambasting the resolution.– Ken Tran
A roll call vote to determine attendance in the House, scheduled for noon, has been postponed as lawmakers continue to debate a resolution that would empower McHenry as an interim speaker.
– Ken Tran
Jordan will back empowering McHenry as temporary speaker up until January, according to a source familiar.
In the meantime, Jordan will continue to run for speaker and work to shore up support over the next few months.
– Ken Tran
Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., chair of the House Freedom Caucus, a loose coalition of hard-right lawmakers, told reporters he would oppose empowering McHenry with temporary powers.
The resolution to make McHenry effectively an interim speaker "sets a bad precedent," Perry said.

House Republicans are currently meeting behind closed doors to discuss a resolution from Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, to temporarily empower McHenry as acting speaker.− Ken Tran
Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., one of the GOP holdouts against Jordan voted for former speaker John Boehner on Wednesday in the second speaker election as a protest vote.
The vote drew some applause from House Democrats.
Boehner served as House speaker from 2011 to 2015 and was virtually removed by House Republicans, led by Jordan and the House Freedom Caucus, who threatened to oust him from the speakership akin to McCarthy’s ejection earlier this month. Boehner ultimately resigned in the face of those threats.

As Jim Jordan still faces stiff opposition from GOP holdouts after failing two consecutive ballots, it is unclear when the House will hold a third speaker election.The House will come into session at noon for a roll call vote to determine attendance, but it's uncertain when a speaker vote will be held.
Jordan, R-Ohio, told reporters Wednesday he intends to stay in the race and expected a vote at noon Thursday. But as it remains clear Jordan has no path towards the 217 votes he needs to become speaker, the timing of the third speaker election is up in the air.

Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., one of the moderate GOP lawmakers opposing Jordan, told USA TODAY the House is in its state of paralysis by the fault of the conservative hardliners who have overturned "precedent."
Hard-right lawmakers, Lawler told USA TODAY, "set a new precedent within this congress." The New York Republican referenced multiple times ultraconservatives tanked rule votes, traditionally procedural votes that until this year, never failed.
The historic move to remove McCarthy from the speakership, Lawler added, was done with "no real planning," resulting in the gridlock that has consumed House Republicans.

Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., was chosen to be acting House speaker from a succession list that McCarthy provided to a House clerk in January in case his seat became vacant.
McHenry is serving his 10th term in Congress and represents the 10th congressional district in North Carolina. He is a McCarthy ally and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, a role that helped him negotiate the debt limit deal earlier this year.
He was appointed in 2015 by then House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., to serve as the Chief Deputy Whip, helping Scalise build agreement around a conservative policy agenda for the House Republican Conference.

No. 
Technically, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries could be elected, as there are no requirements for the speaker to be from the majority party (or even a member of Congress). In both rounds of voting this week, Jeffries has received 212 votes, the full backing of House Democrats and more than Rep. Jim Jordan both times.
However, the New York Democrat would still need five more votes to hit the necessary 217.
Despite infighting among Republicans, it's very doubtful any lawmaker on the right, let alone five, will cast a vote across the aisle.
−Savannah Kuchar
The number of votes needed is determined by a majority of House lawmakers present and voting.
On Tuesday, that number was 217. Because no lawmaker received 217 votes in the first election, the speaker race continues today.
When the vote for speaker begins Wednesday, members will have a roll call vote to determine how many are present and voting − and how many votes are needed to win. Then they will be called on individually to cast their vote for a speaker.
Voting could last several rounds Wednesday or be postponed until another day if a speaker isn't elected during the second try.
– Candy Woodall
Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had a rocky start to his reign as speaker. He went through 15 rounds of voting to get elected and had to make concessions with hard-line conservatives who opposed him.
But once elected, his detractors' frustrations only grew, particularly during debt ceiling negotiations between McCarthy and President Joe Biden
The boiling point of his speakership hit late last month when McCarthy worked with Democrats to pass a stopgap measure, also known as a continuing resolution, to avoid a government shutdown.
Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who criticized McCarthy for the measure, introduced a motion to vacate and remove McCarthy as speaker.
Eight Republicans and 208 Democrats voted to oust him. The eight were Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, Gaetz of Florida, Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Rep. Matt Rosendale of Montana.

Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., is prepared to "step up" and serve as House speaker to help lead the party out of the chaos both it and the nation currently face, his spokesman James Hogge said in an email to the Detriot Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.
"It’s becoming clear Rep. Jordan’s path is narrowing by the hour,” Hogge said. ““We cannot go another day without a Speaker. He simply doesn’t have the votes — we need to have a frank discussion as a conference about a path forward. If as a conference we see he can’t get the necessary votes to become Speaker, General Bergman is prepared to step up."
20 House Republicans voted against Jordan in the first House speaker election while 22 Republicans voted against him in the second election. Bergman supported Jordan in both rounds.
Bergman said on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday that “We need a leader to step up to unite the Republican conference, actually pass critical legislation, and move our Nation forward.”
−Paul Egan and Sudiksha Kochi
The second ballot was another setback for Jordan’s bid for speaker. Twenty-two GOP lawmakers voted against Jordan, an increase from the 20 that opposed him on Tuesday. They are:

After 75-year-old Bay View, Wisconsin, resident Paul Bailey won a gun auction through GunBroker.com in August, he received a UPS tracking number for the package and awaited his new gun's arrival.
But it never made it to the gun store a couple of hours away in Mequon where Bailey was scheduled to pick it up.
Trevor Lawrence has earned a rest.
Playing through a left knee injury suffered four days earlier, the Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback was efficient – if not effervescent – but made his biggest play when his team needed it most. Lawrence’s 44-yard touchdown pass to Christian Kirk with 3:08 left in the fourth quarter proved decisive as the Jags outlasted the New Orleans Saints, 31-24, at the Superdome on Thursday night for their fourth consecutive win. Jacksonville (5-2) extended its AFC South lead while joining the Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins as the conference’s only five-win clubs.
Lawrence completed 20 off 29 passes for 204 yards and, despite the bum knee, ran for a team-high 59 yards on eight carries. Travis Etienne, his teammate since their days at Clemson, scored a pair of touchdowns and linebacker Foyesade Oluokun returned a Derek Carr interception 24 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter.
The win was also Lawrence’s first at the Superdome, his final two seasons at Clemson ending with playoff losses at the famed Big Easy venue.
However, on Thursday, a game the Jags seemed to have in the bag after Oluokun’s score, came down to the wire and likely would have gone to overtime had Saints tight end Foster Moreau caught what seemed to be a gimme 6-yard TD pass from Carr in the game’s final minute. But Moreau couldn’t hang on, and Carr couldn’t convert on his final chance on fourth down as New Orleans dropped to 3-4. ― Nate Davis

Travis Etienne ran for two touchdowns, Foyesade Oluokun returned an interception for a score, and Christian Kirk’s 44-yard touchdown after a short catch over the middle lifted the Jaguars to victory over the Saints.
Jaguars: The Jaguars gave up a 24-9 lead in the fourth quarter, but were able to survive the Saints’ late rally.
The Jaguars broke a four-game losing streak against New Orleans. Prior to Thursday night, Jacksonville’s last victory versus the Saints was on Dec. 21, 2003.
The Jaguars are currently in first place in the AFC South. Jacksonville is 5-2 for the first time since 2007.
Jaguars LB Foyesade Oluokun: Oluokun’s led the NFL in tackles for two straight seasons. His play diagnosis and nose for the football was on display Thursday night.
Oluokun caught a deflected Carr pass and returned it 24 yards for a pick six.
The Jaguars linebacker produced a game-high 14 tackles, two pass deflections, one interception and a touchdown.
Oluokun is a well-respected leader on Jacksonville’s defense, and he shined in the victory.
Travis Etienne reached pay dirt twice: Etienne came into the night with a league-high 113 rushing attempts, 451 rushing yards and five rushing TDs.
The Jaguars running back tallied 77 yards from scrimmage (53 rushing yards and 24 receiving yards) and two touchdowns in the win.
Alvin Kamara only bright spot for Saints on offense: It seemed like Kamara was New Orleans' best and only source of offense for much of the night. Taking handoffs or catching passes out of the backfield, the versatile running back did a little of everything for a Saints offense that could barely move the ball without him.
Kamara had a total of 29 touches (17 carries and 12 receptions) for 153 yards from scrimmage. He led the Saints in carries, catches, rushing yards and receiving yards in the loss.
Derek Carr, Saints offense: The Carr-led Saints offense was booed multiple times Thursday night.
Carr and his wide receivers weren’t on the same page for much of the contest.
Credit to Carr and the Saints offense, they did rally back in the fourth quarter with two touchdowns to tie the game at 24 apiece. But three field goals through the first three quarters wasn’t good enough.
New Orleans’ best offense came on plays designed for Alvin Kamara or Taysom Hill runs.
Carr finished 33-of-55 passing for 301 yards. He had one touchdown and one interception. The Saints quarterback also appeared to injure his groin area late in the game.
Saints' third-down efficiency: The Saints were 3-18 on third downs. The team’s third-down inefficiency probably cost them the game.
Saints' poor red zone offense: The Saints went 2-5 in the red zone. New Orleans’ red zone struggles played a big role why they lost at home.
The most critical red zone mishap came on third down with 30 seconds in remaining in the fourth quarter when tight end Foster Moreau dropped a wide open game-tying touchdown.
Moreau’s drop was a microcosm of the Saints' red zone struggles on Thursday night. ― Tyler Dragon
Saints tight end Foster Moreau dropped a would-be game-tying touchdown in the back on the end zone with 30 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.
The back-breaking drop proved to be costly for the Saints. On fourth down, Derek Carr’s pass to wide receiver Chris Olave was broken up by cornerback Montaric Brown.
The Jaguars were able to get in victory formation after the Saints turned the ball over on downs. New Orleans finished the game 2-5 in the red zone. ― Tyler Dragon
Christian Kirk caught a short pass over the middle from Trevor Lawrence and took it 44 yards to the house.
Kirk made the entire Saints defense look slow after he caught the football and ran up field for the score.
The Jaguars reclaimed the lead, 31-24, after the score.
Kirk has six catches, 90 yards and a touchdown in the game. ― Tyler Dragon
The Saints offense has found some life.
The Saints scored on just three plays after Jacksonville turned the ball over on downs.
Two of New Orleans’ three plays went to wide receiver Michael Thomas, including a great diving catch for a 17-yard touchdown. It was Thomas’ first touchdown of the season.
The Saints scored a two-point conversion after the touchdown to tie the contest 24 apiece.
New Orleans has scored touchdowns on two of its last three possessions after being held out of the end zone for three quarters.  ― Tyler Dragon
A little more than two years ago, Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence fronted the first round of a 2021 NFL draft that included four other passers: Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Justin Fields and Mac Jones. There was little debate at the time that Lawrence, the No. 1 overall pick, was a generational prospect and the best of this bunch, but few could have envisioned he could well be the only one of those quarterbacks to reach a second contract with the team that drafted him.
Lance has already been traded to the Dallas Cowboys, while Wilson, Fields and Jones all face uncertain futures heading into an offseason when their fifth-year options must be picked up or declined. A win tonight would be Lawrence's 18th in the NFL; the other four 2021 first-round QBs have a combined 35 victories. Lawrence's one Pro Bowl nod so far (2022) also matches the rest of the class, Jones earning one as a rookie but nowhere close since. ― Nate Davis
New Orleans was finally able to reach pay dirt.
On fourth-and-goal from the one-yard line, Taysom Hill took a direct snap in shotgun formation and found a hole on the left side for a 1-yard touchdown run.
The Saints are 4-5 on fourth downs in the game. ― Tyler Dragon 
Derek Carr’s forced pass turned disastrous.
Carr tried to force a pass to wide receiver Rashid Shaheed, but it was deflected in the air and intercepted by Jaguars linebacker Foyesade Oluokun, who went 24 yards for a touchdown.
The Superdome crowd booed again after the pick six.
Oluokun’s interception increased Jacksonville’s lead, 24-9. ― Tyler Dragon 
The Saints home fans have seen enough field goals.
The New Orleans crowd booed again when the Saints offense had to settle for three following an 11-play drive that went 52 yards to start the second half.
After the Saints offense was unable to convert a third-and-20, kicker Blake Grupe made a 42-yard field goal to make the score, 17-9.
Grupe’s made three of his four field goals tonight. ― Tyler Dragon 
Since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, Hall of Fame RB Walter Payton is the only player to have more games (25) with a pass attempt, carry and catch than New Orleans utilityman Taysom Hill (20).
Hill has two carries for 12 yards so far tonight. ― Nate Davis
The Saints entered tonight's game with the NFL's sixth-ranked scoring defense. The Raiders never ranked better than 20th in that category during QB Derek Carr's nine seasons with the franchise. Alas, like the other quarterbacks New Orleans has used since Drew Brees' retirement, Carr has yet to engineer an offense able to capably supplement the other side of the ball. ― Nate Davis
The Saints were booed multiple times in the first half after their offense failed to score a touchdown. New Orleans only scored three points off two Jacksonville turnovers.
The Saints offense went 0-2 in the red zone, and they are 1-8 on third downs. ― Tyler Dragon 
Tonight is the first time the Saints' new-look backfield has been completely available. RB Jamaal Williams, signed in the offseason after leading the NFL with 17 rushing touchdowns in 2022 (while in Detroit), started the first two weeks but missed the next four games with a hamstring injury. RB Alvin Kamara, the franchise's all-time leader in all-purpose yards, missed the first three weeks while serving a suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy. And, of course, QB Derek Carr was signed in the offseason as the Saints continue to phase into their post-Drew Brees existence. But not a banner night thus far offensively. In fact, the Saints have only scored 19 points in the six quarters since they demolished the Patriots 34-0 in Week 5. Williams and Kamara have combined for 82 yards from scrimmage, 60 of them receiving yards from Kamara. Carr has completed 11 of 21 passes for 100 yards. ― Nate Davis
Doug Pederson’s fourth-down gamble paid off.
The Jaguars called a fake punt on fourth-and-2. Jacksonville’s special teams unit snapped the football and the punter Logan Cooke threw a perfect pass to Tim Jones for a 13-yard gain.
The fake punt set up a successful 43-yard field goal by Brandon McManus.
Jacksonville has a 17-6 lead. ― Tyler Dragon
The Saints are 0-2 in the red zone in the first half.
Derek Carr and the Saints converted a fourth-and-3 to keep their possession going, but their drive stalled again in the red zone.
On third-and-8 Carr couldn’t find an open receiver so he scrambled right for a short gain. The Saints again had to settle for a field goal.
Kicker Blake Grupe made a 35-yard field goal to cut New Orleans’ deficit, 14-6.
Grupe has now made two of three field goals in the game. ― Tyler Dragon
Entering tonight, Jags WR Calvin Ridley is averaging 4.3 receptions and 60.5 receiving yards per game during his six-game stint with Jacksonville ― right around his career pace outside of his 2020 outlier season with the Atlanta Falcons. That year, much of it played opposite Pro Bowler Julio Jones ― he missed seven games ― Ridley exploded for 90 receptions, 1,374 yards and nine TDs, all easily career highs save the TD production. So is Ridley Batman or Robin? The Jaguars will have to make that determination in the offseason, when his rookie contract ― it tolled one season after his 2022 suspension for a gambling violation ― expires and renders him a free agent (assuming he isn't franchised). Ridley has yet to be targeted in this game. ― Nate Davis
Two first quarter fumbles haven’t slowed down the Jags.
After holding New Orleans to a field goal after a muffed punt, the Jaguars went 75 yards down the field in seven plays to reach the end zone for the second time.
Jacksonville’s touchdown came on a nifty misdirection jet sweep. Jags QB Trevor Lawrence pitched the football to RB Travis Etienne and he raced down the left side for a 17-yard touchdown.
Etienne has six rushes, 30 yards and two touchdowns in the first half.
The New Orleans crowd booed after Etienne’s second touchdown. The Saints are down 14-3. ― Tyler Dragon
The Saints started their third possession on Jacksonville’s 17-yard line, thanks to a Jaguars muffed punt. But Jacksonville’s defense was able to keep New Orleans out of the end zone.
The Saints converted one first down and had first and goal from the 6-yard line, but their touchdown efforts failed on three attempts inside the 10-yard line.
New Orleans had to settle for a Blake Grupe short 23-yard field goal.
Grupe has made one of his two field goal attempts. ― Tyler Dragon
The Saints got quick reprieves from their missed field goal. On the ensuing play, Jags WR Christian Kirk fumbled after a 19-yard gain, the ball forced from his grip by CB Paulson Adebo. New Orleans took over at its own 41 ... but didn't need long to go three-and-out. Yet the Saints got the ball right back on the Jacksonville 17-yard line after Tevaughn Campbell collided with Jags teammate Jamal Agnew, who was trying to field the punt. New Orleans recovered and is back in business. ― Nate Davis
Blake Grupe’s Week 7 is going similar to his Week 6.
The Saints rookie kicker missed two field goals last week, and he missed his first field goal attempt in Week 7.
Grupe sailed a 51-yard field goal wide right on New Orleans’ opening drive. ― Tyler Dragon
Travis Etienne, who entered Thursday leading the NFL in touches (134), became the first running back to score a TD against the Saints since Dec. 18, 2022. The only other rushing touchdown surrendered by New Orleans this season was a 1-yard run by Packers QB Jordan Love. ― Nate Davis
The Saints defense hadn’t allowed an opening drive touchdown all season, until Week 7.
Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars marched down the field on a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown drive in just over five minutes. Jacksonville converted six first downs on its opening drive.
Lawrence completed five of six passes for 60 yards. Running back Travis Etienne reached the end zone on a 2-yard run to give the Jags an early 7-0 advantage.  ― Tyler Dragon
Jaguars vs. Saints begins at 8:15 p.m. ET on Oct. 19.
Jaguars at Saints will be streaming exclusively on Amazon Prime Video and will be broadcast in local markets only.
The Jaguars announced that Trevor Lawrence was active for Thursday night's matchup with the Saints. The Saints, however, will be without two starting offensive linemen, with James Hurst and Ryan Ramczyk inactive.
Jaguars' inactive players:
Saints' inactive players:
Lorenzo Reyes: Saints 21, Jaguars 17
This is a tricky one, with the status of Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence up in the air. But with the quick turnaround with the Thursday game, I would expect Lawrence to be hindered — if he can go at all. If you’re leaning Saints, it might not be bad to jump on this sooner rather than later, assuming the line moves if Lawrence is ruled out.
Tyler Dragon: Jaguars 24, Saints 20
Jacksonville’s won three straight games. New Orleans has dropped three of its last four. Trevor Lawrence’s knee injury is a concern, but the team expects him to play. The quick turnaround favors New Orleans. However, Derek Carr and the Saints are still trying to figure themselves out offensively.
Victoria Hernandez: Jaguars 23, Saints 21
The Jaguars are tried and true on the road and showed last week that their success in London wasn’t a fluke. Yes, it will be harder if Trevor Lawrence is out, but the Saints haven’t found enough consistency to compete with the multi-dimensional Jacksonville offense.
Jordan Mendoza: Saints 16, Jaguars 14
Trevor Lawrence’s health is a big concern, and the Saints defense has only given up more than 20 points once this season. The New Orleans offense isn’t great, but they hold down Jacksonville enough for a close win.
... it's been a minute. In fact, nearly two decades since it happened and is famous for one of the wildest finishes in league history.
That game occurred Dec. 21, 2003, in a game that became known as the "River City Relay." It occurred in Duval County in Week 16 and was a must-win affair for New Orleans' playoff hopes. Down 20-13 with 9 seconds remaining, the Saints scored a remarkable touchdown, WR Jerome Pathon scoring after a series of laterals that covered 75 yards on the final play from scrimmage. Then ... New Orleans kicker John Carney sailed the extra-point attempt wide ride. Jags 20, Saints 19 ... no playoffs in The Big Easy. ― Nate Davis
... was also in New Orleans — and in prime time. It was Aug. 23, 2021 — preseason — a game the Saints won 23-21 on a Monday night. On that evening, then-rookie QB Trevor Lawrence showed his inexperience, taking a huge hit on a third-down run but surviving it. RB Travis Etienne suffered a Lisfranc injury that would ultimately cost him his entire rookie season. And then-coach Urban Meyer was clearly agitated throughout the night, managed the game like it counted in the standings and seemed crushed by the loss — among the attributes that would scuttle his only season as an NFL head coach before he could reach the end of it. Chances are, tonight will go better for Lawrence, Etienne and current head coach Doug Pederson. ― Nate Davis
... and the game actually counted? It was his final game at Clemson, the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day 2021. Lawrence was good that night, passing for 400 yards and two TDs. He was also thoroughly outplayed by Ohio State and their quarterback, Justin Fields, who exploded for 385 yards and six TDs through the air in a gritty performance that advanced the Buckeyes to the CFP championship game against Alabama. ― Nate Davis

BALTIMORE — Will Smith joined Jada Pinkett Smith on stage as she promoted her new memoir in her Baltimore hometown Wednesday night, pledging lifelong support for her just a week after she revealed that the couple had been separated since 2016.
"Jada is the best friend I have ever had on this planet, and I am going to show up for her and support her for the rest of my life," he told the crowd at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, crediting Pinkett Smith's sacrifices for his successes, news outlets reported.
Smith's appearance with their two children, Jaden and Willow, and his son Trey Smith, was apparently a surprise for Pinkett Smith. It came at the end of a talk about her book, "Worthy." Pinkett Smith said the family, including her aunt and uncle and Will Smith's mother and sister, was in town to celebrate the 70th birthday of her mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, on Wednesday.
Smith called their relationship "brutiful," explaining that it was both brutal and beautiful.

Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
"It is a sloppy public experiment in unconditional love," he said, a description that prompted Pinkett Smith to double over in laughter.
Pinkett Smith told The Baltimore Sun that their estrangement was in the past and that she and Smith have been working in the last 18 months to repair their relationship.
"Will and me are good," Pinkett Smith told Laura Coates of CNN, who moderated Wednesday night's discussion. "All the people who don't understand and got something to say are just going to have to fall in line.

"The truth of the matter is I'm not leaving Will's side and he's not going to leave mine. We've been on a powerful quest. And I'm happier than I've ever been," she added.
The book by the actor, who first revealed the bombshell news of their separation to NBC's Hoda Kotb, details their marriage, her Hollywood journey, her unconventional parenting style and gives her perspective of Smith infamously slapping Chris Rock during the 2022 Academy Awards ceremony over a joke about her shaved head (Pinkett Smith revealed in 2018 that she had a form of alopecia).
Pinkett Smith told The Associated Press that she is feeling free since opening up about the separation.
"It's a weight off my shoulders, honestly," Pinkett Smith said in an AP interview this week. "Ever since the Oscars, it's so interesting how such an intense event can bring you closer together, and I would say that after that, we really dove in and dug in and got to this beautiful place we are now."
