When Angel Amankwaah traveled from Denver to North Carolina Central University for incoming student orientation this summer, she decided she had made the right choice. 
She had fun learning the chants that fans perform at football games. But she also saw that “there are students who look like me, and professors who look like me” at the historically Black university, said Amankwaah, 18, who is Black. “I knew that I was in a safe space.”
This has in the past two years become an important consideration for college-bound students from all backgrounds and beliefs. With so much attention focused on these issues, USA TODAY and The Hechinger Report present the first-of-its-kind College Welcome Guide showing state laws and institutional policies that affect college and university students, from bans on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and “critical race theory” to rules about guns on campus and whether student IDs are accepted as proof of residency for voting purposes.
The digital tables also list, for every four-year institution in the country, such things as racial and gender diversity among students and faculty, the number of student veterans enrolled, the incidence of on-campus race-motivated hate crimes, free-speech rankings and if the university or college serves many students from rural places.
Test our new College Welcome Guide:These tools offer a new lens on campus life.
Students have long picked schools based on their academic reputations and social life. But with campuses in the crosshairs of the culture wars, many students are now also taking stock of attacks on diversity, course content and speech and speakers from both ends of the political spectrum. They’re monitoring hate crimes, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, state abortion laws and whether students like them ‒ Black, rural, military veterans, LGBTQ+ or from other backgrounds ‒ are represented and supported on campus.
“There’s no question that what’s happening at the state level is directly affecting these students,” said Alyse Levine, founder and CEO of Premium Prep, a private college admissions consulting firm in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. When they look at colleges in various states now, she said, “There are students who are asking, ‘Am I really wanted here?’”
For some students on both sides of the political divide, the answer is no. In the chaotic new world of American colleges and universities, many say they feel unwelcome at certain schools, while others are prepared to shut down speakers and report faculty with whose opinions they disagree.
It’s too early to know how much this trend will affect where and whether prospective students end up going to college since publicly available enrollment data lags real time. But there are early clues that it’s having a significant impact.
One in 4 prospective students has already ruled out a college or university for consideration because of the political climate in its state, according to a survey by the higher education consulting firm Art & Science Group.
Among students who describe themselves as liberal, the most common reason to rule out colleges and universities in a particular state, that survey found, is because it’s “too Republican” or has what they consider lax gun regulations, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, restrictive abortion laws and a lack of concern about racism. Students who describe themselves as conservative are rejecting states they believe to be “too Democrat” and that have liberal abortion and gay rights laws.
Sixty percent of prospective students of all backgrounds say new state restrictions on abortion would at least somewhat influence where they choose to go to college, a separate poll by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation found. Of these, 8 in 10 say they would prefer to go to a state with greater access to reproductive health services. (Lumina is among the funders of The Hechinger Report, which produced this story.)
“We have many young women who will not look at certain states,” said Levine. One of her own clients backed out of going to a university in St. Louis after Missouri banned almost all abortions following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, she said.
Institutions in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Texas are the most likely to be knocked off the lists of liberal students, according to the Art & Science Group survey. They’re generally most likely to steer clear of the South and Midwest, while conservative students avoid California and New York.
One in 8 high school students in Florida say they won’t go to a public university in their own state because of its education policies, a separate poll, by the college ranking and information website Intelligent.com, found.
With 494 anti-LGBTQ+ laws proposed or adopted this year, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, prospective students who are LGBTQ+ and have experienced significant harassment because of it are nearly twice as likely to say they don't plan to go to college at all compared with students who experienced lower levels of harassment, according to a survey by GLSEN, formerly the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.
“You are attacking kids who are already vulnerable,” said Javier Gomez, an LGBTQ+ student in his first year at Miami Dade College. “And it’s not just queer students. So many young people are fed up.”
It’s not yet evident whether the new laws are affecting where LGBTQ+ young people are choosing to go to college, said Casey Pick, director of law and policy at The Trevor Project, which supports LGBTQ+ young people in crisis. But LGBTQ+ adults are moving away from states passing anti-LGBTQ+ laws, she said. And “if adult employees are taking this into account when they decide where they want to live, you can bet that college students are making the same decisions.”
Since DeSantis takeover,surge in dropouts at New College of Florida
Meanwhile, in an era of pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion policies in many states, and against affirmative action in college admissions nationwide, Amankwaah is one of a growing number of Black students choosing what they see as the relative security of an HBCU. Enrollment at HBCUs increased by around 3% in 2021, the last year for which the figure is available, while the number of students at other universities and colleges fell. 
“The real attack here is on the feeling of belonging,” said Jeremy Young, who directs the Freedom to Learn program at PEN America, which tracks laws that restrict college and university diversity efforts and teaching about race. “What it really does is hoist a flag to say to the most marginalized students, ‘We don’t want you here.’” 
More than 40% of university and college administrators say the Supreme Court ruling curbing the use of affirmative action in admissions will affect diversity on their campuses, a Princeton Review poll found as the school year was beginning.
College students of all races and political persuasions report feeling uncomfortable on campuses that have become political battlegrounds. Those on the left are bristling at new laws blocking programs in diversity, equity and inclusion and the teaching of certain perspectives about race; on the right, at conservative speakers being shouted down or canceled, unpopular comments being called out in class and what they see as an embrace of values different from what they learned at home.
More than 1 in 10 students at four-year universities now say they feel as if they downright don’t belong on their campus, and another 2 in 10 neither agree nor strongly agree that they belong, another Lumina and Gallup survey found. It found that those who answer in these ways are more likely to frequently experience stress and more likely to drop out.
Military veterans who use their GI Bill benefits to return to school say one of their most significant barriers is a feeling that they won’t be welcome, a survey by the D’Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University found. Nearly two-thirds say that faculty and administrators don’t understand the challenges they face, and 70% say the same thing about their non-veteran classmates. 
Colleges should be “safe and affirming spaces,” said Pick, of the Trevor Project ‒ not places of isolation and alienation.
Yet a significant number of students say they don’t feel comfortable sharing their views in class, according to another survey, conducted by College Pulse for the right-leaning Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at North Dakota State University. Of those, 72% say they worry their opinions would be considered unacceptable by classmates and 45%, by their professors. Conservative students are less likely than their liberal classmates to believe that all points of view are welcome and less willing to share theirs. 
“Is that really an intellectually diverse environment?” asked Sean Stevens, director of polling and analytics at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, which has launched a campus free-speech ranking based on students’ perceptions of comfort expressing ideas, tolerance for speakers and other measures. 
“Anecdotally and from personal experience, there’s certainly a pocket of students who are weighing these factors in terms of where to go to college,” Stevens said.
Eighty-one percent of liberal students and 53% of conservative ones say they support reporting faculty who make comments that they find offensive, the same survey found. It used sample comments such as, “There is no evidence of anti-Black bias in police shootings,” “Requiring vaccination for COVID is an assault on individual freedom” and “Biological sex is a scientific fact.”
A professor at Texas A&M University became the subject of an investigation when a student accused her of criticizing the state’s lieutenant governor during a lecture, though she was ultimately exonerated. An anthropology lecturer at the University of Chicago who taught an undergraduate course called “The Problem of Whiteness” said she was deluged with hateful messages when a conservative student posted her photo and email address on social media.
More than half of all freshmen say that colleges have the right to ban extreme speakers, according to an annual survey by an institute at the University of California, Los Angeles; the College Pulse poll says that sentiment is held by twice the proportion of liberal students as conservative ones.
A group of Stanford students in March disrupted an on-campus speech by a federal judge whose judicial record they said was anti-LGBTQ+. When he asked for an administrator to intervene, an associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion confronted him and asked: “Is it worth the pain that this causes and the division that this causes?” The associate dean was put on leave and later resigned. 
“Today it is a sad fact that the greatest threat to free speech comes from within the academy,” pronounced the right-leaning American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which is pushing colleges to sign on to its Campus Freedom Initiative that encourages teaching students about free expression during freshman orientation and disciplining people who disrupt speakers or events, among other measures.
“I have to imagine that universities that have a bad track record on freedom of expression or academic freedom, that it will affect their reputations,” said Steven Maguire, the organization’s campus freedom fellow. “I do hear people saying things like, ‘I’m worried about what kind of a college or university I can send my kids to and whether they’ll be free to be themselves and to express themselves.’”
Some colleges are now actively recruiting students on the basis of these kinds of concerns. Colorado College in September created a program to ease the process for students who want to transfer away from institutions in states that have banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; Hampshire College in Massachusetts has offered admission to any student from New College in Florida, subject of what critics have described as a conservative takeover. Thirty-five have so far accepted the invitation.
Though many conservative critics of colleges and universities say faculty are indoctrinating students with liberal opinions, incoming freshmen tend to hold left-leaning views before they ever set foot in a classroom, according to that UCLA survey.
Fewer than 1 in 5 consider themselves conservative. Three-quarters say abortion should be legal and favor stricter gun control laws, 68% say wealthy people should pay more taxes than they do now and 86% that climate change should be a federal priority and that there should be a clear path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
Prospective students say they are watching as new laws are passed and controversies erupt on campuses and actively looking into not just the quality of food and available majors at the colleges they might attend, but state politics.
“Once I decided I was going to North Carolina Central, I looked up whether North Carolina was a red state or a blue state,” Amankwaah said. (North Carolina has a Democrat as governor but Republicans control both chambers of the legislature and hold a veto-proof supermajority in the state Senate. 
Florida’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws prompted Javier Gomez to leave his native state and move to New York to go to fashion school. But then he came back, transferring to Miami Dade.
“People ask me, ‘Why the hell are you back in Florida?’” said Gomez. “The reason I came back was that there was this innate calling in me that you have to stick around and fight for the queer and trans kids here. It’s overwhelming at times. It can be very mentally depleting. But I wanted to stay and continue the fight and build community against hatred.”

Thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed and Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate from the northern Gaza Strip ahead of Israel's impending ground invasion, leading to a humanitarian crisis that has brought protests from the United Nations and around the world.
The U.N. said about 1 million Gaza residents have been displaced in just a week, about half of them finding refuge in U.N. schools and other facilities where water supplies are diminishing. The war has claimed more than 4,000 lives since Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack Oct. 7.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization pleaded with Israel on Sunday to immediately reverse evacuation orders for hospitals in northern Gaza, saying the deadlines are impossible to meet and risk additional loss of life. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that attacks on health care facilities are already causing deaths and injuries. 
"The health situation in north Gaza is dire," Tedros wrote on social media. "Evacuation orders by Israel to hospitals are practically impossible to implement and are a death sentence for the sick and injured."
Here are several organizations that are providing aid to people caught in the conflict.
How to cope:The videos out of Israel, Gaza are graphic, but some can't look away
The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) is a coalition of more than 170 nongovernmental organizations that includes tens of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis who share the goal of building peace between the two communities.
"Our members are speaking loudly and clearly about the values that unite our community: Opposition to this horrific violence, and a commitment to Israeli/Palestinian partnership on the path to ending it, and achieving peace and equality," the agency said in a statement.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is a humanitarian organization that aims to protect and aid victims of conflicts. The ICRC has been in Israel and the occupied territories since 1967. The organization is asking for donations to improve access to essential services like water and to support livelihood projects.
Doctors Without Borders is a nongovernmental organization that describes itself as an "independent, impartial and neutral" charity that provides humanitarian aid to people affected by conflict, disease outbreaks and natural and human-made disasters.
The agency is seeking donations to continue to provide medical care in the area. The agency has reported overcrowding in hospitals, a lack of medical supplies, and dangerous working conditions as it tries to support the thousands injured by the fighting.
UNRWA has designated shelters to host the estimated 127,000 people displaced in Gaza. The agency is seeking donations to support its work.
The Jewish Agency for Israel North American Council, an American charity organization, is accepting donations to help victims of terrorism.
Save the Children issued an emergency alert in response to the conflict, noting that escalating violence has left 1.2 million children in need of humanitarian aid. The agency is accepting donations.
National and international organizations that aid victims in the conflict include the Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF), which works to provide lifesaving medical relief and humanitarian aid.
Founded by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, in partnership with Emory University, The Carter Center is a humanitarian aid organization that has been promoting peace and a viable two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades.
After Israel declared war, The Carter Center released a statement condemning the targeting of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and called for international action to end the violence.

The soap opera that has consumed members of Congress for nearly three weeks over electing a new speaker is testing the patience of the voters who sent them to Washington, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds.
An overwhelming 67% say the House should elect a speaker as soon as possible, given the need to approve wartime aid for Israel and Ukraine and to prevent a government shutdown that looms next month.
"We got to have a speaker, (but) I don't think we're going to have anybody soon," said George Ramge, 72, of San Diego, a building contractor and political independent. "There's a lot of Hollywood politicians out there getting their time on TV, and I don't think they're really serving the people's purpose."
"They need to be functioning, and that's the only way they're going to function," said Carl Hickey, 85, of Monkton, Maryland, a retired Methodist minister and a Democrat, said in a follow-up interview after being called in the poll.
Just 25% of those surveyed say they don't care whether a speaker is elected, on the theory that the impasse is preventing Congress from wasting more taxpayer money.
"It's not like they do anything anyways," said Dustin Gibbons, 34, a home warranty manager from Queen Creek, Arizona, and a Republican. "I don't think that a speaker in the House is going to do anything other than, you know, just keep kicking that ball along."
The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cell phone Tuesday through Friday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
In a political world where bipartisanship is the exception, there is a broad consensus on this. By double-digit margins, the idea of electing a speaker, and fast, was endorsed not only among Democrats (86%-10%) but also Republicans (57%-34%) and independents (59%-32%).
"How often do you see Democrats, Republicans, and independents agree on anything in DC?" said David Paleologos, director of Suffolk's Political Research Center. "Look at every demographic: gender, geography, age, race, education level, income, political philosophy, even those who trust CNN vs Fox News. They are all speaking the same seven words in unison: 'Elect a speaker and do your job.'"
The previous House speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was ousted from the post by a handful of combative conservatives, just eight of them but enough given the GOP's narrow majority. Since then, no potential successor has been able to command the 217 votes needed. Ohio congressman Jim Jordan was defeated three times before the Republican caucus voted Friday to sideline him.
House Republicans are scheduled to meet late Monday to figure out what to do next.
The scenes of Capitol chaos displayed on cable TV last week may be eroding voters' confidence in the ability of the nation's leaders in the White House and Congress to address the nation's major challenges.
Just 4% of those surveyed express "a lot" of confidence in leaders; another 32% had "some" confidence. But the largest group, 35%, have "very little" confidence and another 27% had none at all.
"If I could go negative five, I would give it a negative 100," Gibbons said.
Democrats, who traditionally have supported a bigger role for government, have more confidence in its ability to solve problems; 63% had "a lot" or "some" confidence.
But Republicans, whose leaders in recent years have portrayed the government as either incompetent or dangerous, were overwhelmingly skeptical that Washington could be trusted to do anything right. A plurality of Republicans, 42%, said they had no confidence in government; another 38% had "very little."
Ratings for the Senate are nothing to brag about, with 36% having a favorable view, and 42% an unfavorable one.
But ratings for the House are even worse. Just 25% see it favorably; more than double that, 54%, view it unfavorably.
Once there is a speaker, most voters have a suggestion of what they want them to do next: A compromise that avoids a government shutdown when the latest temporary funding bill expires Nov. 17.
More than six in 10, 61%, want negotiations to reach a deal. "I mean, don't we live in a bipartisan world?" said Desiree Whitney, 64, of Boerne, Texas, an independent who voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020. "Why should it stop, you know at our government, or does it begin there? I mean, it's all about negotiations."
But there's a catch. While just 31% want their representatives to stand firm on demands to cut spending, even if it means a government shutdown, that group includes a 55% majority of Republicans. Only 37% in the GOP endorse a negotiated compromise.
And Republicans control what happens in the House − assuming, of course, they succeed in electing a speaker.
Gymnast Kara Eaker announced Friday on Instagram her retirement from the University of Utah women’s gymnastics team and withdrawal as a student, citing verbal and emotional abuse from a coach and lack of support from the administration.
“For two years, while training with the Utah Gymnastics team, I was a victim of verbal and emotional abuse,” Eaker wrote in a post. “As a result, my physical, mental and emotional health has rapidly declined. I had been seeing a university athletics psychologist for a year and a half and I’m now seeing a new provider twice a week because of suicidal and self-harm ideation and being unable to care for myself properly. I have recently been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, anxiety induced insomnia, and I suffer from panic attacks, PTSD and night terrors. …
“I have now reached a turning point and I’m speaking out for all of the women who can’t because they are mentally debilitated and paralyzed by fear.”
Eaker, 20, is an elite American gymnast who was part of U.S. gold-medal teams at the 2018 and 2019 world championships. She was named an alternate at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and was a member of Utah’s teams that finished third at the NCAA championships in 2022 and 2023. Utah is one of the top programs in women’s college gymnastics.
USA TODAY Sports has reached out to the University of Utah for comment.
“I was a promised a ‘family’ within this program and a ‘sisterhood’ with my teammates, who would accept me, care for me, and support,” Eaker wrote. “But instead, as I entered as a freshman, I was heartbroken to find the opposite in that I was training in an unhealthy, unsafe and toxic environment."
She alleged “loud and angry outbursts” that involved cursing from a coach.
Eaker said the abuse “often happened in individual coach-athlete meetings. I would be isolated in an office with an overpowering coach, door closed, sitting quietly, hardly able to speak because of the condescending, sarcastic and manipulative tactics."
When Eaker went to university officials with her allegations, she wrote, "One administrator denied there was any abuse and said, 'You two are like oil and water, you just don't get along.' To say I was shocked would be an understatement and this is a prime example of gaslighting. So therein lies the problem − the surrounding people and system are complicit."
Eaker does not name any coach in her post. Tom Farden has been coaching at Utah since 2011, a co-head coach from 2016-2019 and sole head coach from 2020. Last month, an investigation into Farden by Husch Blackwell concluded Farden, “did not engage in any severe, pervasive or egregious acts of emotional or verbal abuse of student-athletes” and “did not engage in any acts of physical abuse, emotional abuse or harassment as defined by SafeSport Code.”
However, the investigation found Farden “made a derogatory comment to a student-athlete that if she was not at the University she would be a ‘nobody working at a gas station’ in her hometown” and “a few student-athletes alleged that Coach Farden made comments to student-athletes that, if corroborated, would have likely resulted in a finding that they violated the Athletics’ Well Being Policy’s prohibition on degrading language. The comments as alleged were isolated occurrences that could not be independently corroborated and were denied by Coach Farden.”
In her Instagram post, Eaker called the investigation “incomplete at best, and I disagree with their findings. I don’t believe it has credibility because the report omits crucial evidence and information and the few descriptions used are inaccurate.”
It's well known that having obesity increases the risk of a wide range of health conditions, but data suggests it may not be just the extra weight that adds risk.
Medications may not work as well on people with obesity, studies suggest, because, although people with a lot of body fat metabolize drugs differently, they aren't required to be included in research trials. So prescribed doses may be too high in some cases and linger too long in others.
And with more than 40% of Americans now living with obesity, and a wide range of popular drugs potentially affected, this dosing deficit is likely having a major impact on many people's lives and health, several experts said.
Studies have found people taking regular medication for birth control, or to combat high cholesterol, depression or panic disorders might be getting the wrong amount of needed medication.
It's "a huge problem for the population," said Dr. William Dietz, who directs the STOP Obesity Alliance at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and co-wrote a recent paper on the topic.
Dietz blames weight bias for the lack of attention to a major portion of the population. "I think it's because people don't care about obesity."
For Courtney Gilbert, of Big Rapids, Michigan, the depression that overtook her in 2019 was deep and lingering and drugs simply weren't helping.
"I tried medication after medication after medication," said Gilbert, who works for the local public library system. "This coming up does make me wonder if my weight had something to do with it."
She eventually overcame her depression with therapy, a strong support system, more stability and the passage of time after a major loss.
The dosage of antipsychotic medications, like the one Gilbert took for months to no effect, does not get altered by prescribing doctors based on a patient's weight. But body fat affects how quickly the body processes the antipsychotic brexpiprazole, sold under the brand name Rexulti.
Someone with a lot of body fat will process drugs like brexpiprazole more slowly than a person with less and will therefore need a higher dose to get the same benefit, said Dr. Caroline Apovian, an author of a poster on the drug trials and obesity presented this month at ObesityWeek 2023 in Dallas.
"The dosing and the pharmacokinetics all have to do with when and how much enters the bloodstream and it's in the bloodstream that the drugs have their effects," said Apovian, who also co-directs the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
"If you don't test patients of size and you're dosing a drug based on the bloodstream entrance of patients with 'normal' body fat ‒ the doses for normal body weight might not be effective for those with obesity."
Medications also hang around a large body longer, potentially causing side effects or interacting with other medications.
But Apovian and her co-authors showed that more than half the drug trials underway do not mention body mass index in their official descriptions on clinicaltrials.gov.
When body mass, a typical measure of obesity, is mentioned, it is generally used to exclude people with obesity from being in a trial altogether, they found.
"It's nuts," said Ted Kyle, another of the poster's authors, who writes the blog ConscienHealth. "It's not like you have to do deep studies with every drug, but at minimum, we ought to be saying, 'Oh, would this be a problem?'"
Regulators don't require that drugs be specifically tested in people with large amounts of body fat, so even if doctors wanted to prescribe a higher dose, they wouldn't know how much to give or which drugs were most likely affected, Apovian and other experts said.
The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates drug approvals and sets requirements for drugs trials, acknowledges the problem.
FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf, speaking at a workshop a year ago, said there's a "deficit of information" about how drugs affect people with obesity and that they're often underrepresented in research trials.
He said he hoped workshop participants from FDA, the University of Maryland and elsewhere would help close this information gap "to ensure that we're making progress toward appropriate drug dosing in the obese patient."
People with obesity aren't necessarily excluded from clinical trials, but they may be reluctant to participate because of poor experiences with the medical system. They may also be excluded because of other health issues they face, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Or it's possible that companies running the trials simply do not analyze obesity even as they consider sex, age and race important factors.
Regulators have said obesity adds to variability in trials, which is why companies aren't required to include people with obesity at the outset. But Dietz, from the STOP Obesity Alliance, said that's precisely why they should be included.
Also, he said, only half-jokingly, he'd expect drug companies would want to identify patients who would benefit from a higher dose of medications because they could be charged more.
Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, praised the companies involved in COVID-19 vaccine trials for including a large percentage of people with obesity. If they could do it, with the time pressure they were under, then other companies can do it, too, she said.
"I'm not going to give them a pass on this," she said of other drug companies and trials. At least 40% of adults and 20% of children in clinical trials for all sorts of drugs, not just those addressing obesity, need to be of a higher body mass index, she said.
Cody Stanford said she's particularly disturbed by the lack of data for drugs like brexpiprazole, which are intended for a population already facing a stigmatizing mental health condition.
People with schizophrenia or depression are more likely to have obesity than the general population. One 2017 study found that 59% of people with schizophrenia had obesity. Drugs used to treat schizophrenia are known to increase body weight.
"There are so many layers of badness that can happen here if it's not tested well and doesn't reach effective levels in people with obesity," she said. "This is a recipe for disaster in a condition that's not well understood, even if it is well treated."
Dietz and several colleagues published a paper in August showing that a number of commonly used drugs are fat soluble, meaning they would take longer to reach an effective dose in the bloodstream of someone with a lot of body fat.
The paper listed a number of common drugs its authors thought might be affected by a person's body size:
In another example provided in that study, which appeared in the journal "Health Affairs," the anti-fungal drug posaconazole has a warning in its packaging that it might be ineffective in patients with obesity at the typical dosage. But there's no instruction about what the right dose might be. And because it lasts in the body of a larger person longer than in a person without obesity, it might interact with other drugs given at the same time.
If these drugs are not adjusted for the person's body fat they may be less effective or not effective at all, said Dietz, who also directs the Sumner M. Redstone Global Center for Prevention and Wellness at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health.
"The provider's response might be, 'Why aren't you taking the drug?' (They) blame the patient when in fact, it's the pharmacodynamics that should be blamed."
What Dietz wants is for every doctor who treats a patient with obesity to know if the drug they are prescribing is potentially affected by that patient's body weight. "It should be top-of-mind when writing a prescription," he said, though he admits it's unclear how to adjust drug dosage.
For her part, Gilbert said she naturally assumed because her medication had been prescribed by a doctor that it had been researched and dosed properly. Luckily, she got through her period of suicidal thinking without acting on it, but other people, given an ineffective dose, might not.
"It's definitely something that (people need) to be made aware of so it doesn't keep happening," she said. "Starting with judgments or assumptions that we don't care that we're overweight or this is just a choice ‒ and that because we're overweight we don't deserve adequate medical care."
If that is an assumption someone has," Gilbert said. "That's not okay."

The Israeli military ramped up its reach Sunday, striking targets in Syria, the West Bank and Gaza amid growing concerns the war will spread more widely across the Middle East.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian warned Israel and the U.S on Sunday that "if they do not immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza, anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control."
The intensified military actions came as a convoy of humanitarian aid trucks made its way into Gaza from Egypt for a second day. But the U.N. warned the aid is about 4% of the daily average of imports into previous conflicts and a fraction of what is needed.
Israel has been pounding Gaza relentlessly since Hamas' stunning, brutal attack Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,000 Israelis and saw the seizure of more than 200 hostages.
"Bombardments continue almost unabated as hostilities enter the 15th day in Gaza," the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in its latest situation report.
First humanitarian aid reaches Gaza:Convoy arrives after 2 weeks of Israel-Hamas war
Developments:
∎ The Rafah crossing from Egypt, which opened Saturday with the passage of 20 aid trucks, saw 17 more trucks carrying food, water and medical supplies enter Gaza on Sunday. The U.N. humanitarian affairs agency says it is "imperative" to increase the number to at least 100 trucks per day.
∎ Hezbollah’s deputy leader in Lebanon, Sheikh Naim Kassem, warned that Israel would pay a high price going forward if it commences a much-anticipated ground offensive in Gaza.
Syria said it was forced to shut down international airports in Damascus and Aleppo because of the Israeli strike. The Syrian Transport Ministry said landing strips at both airports were damaged by missiles and one civilian worker was killed and another wounded at Damascus International Airport. Israel has carried out several strikes in Syria since the war began, citing the need to prevent Hezbollah and other militant groups from bringing in arms from Iran, which also supports Hamas.
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed at least five people there early Sunday, according to the local Health Ministry. Two were killed in an airstrike on a mosque in the town of Jenin, which the Israeli military said belonged to Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who had carried out several attacks and were planning another one.
Palestinian militants have fired over 7,000 rockets into Israel since the war began, the Israel Defense Force says, and tens of thousands of Israeli's have been forced to flee their homes. Hamas says it targeted Tel Aviv early Sunday.
The Israeli death toll has surpassed 1,400, most of the civilians killed in the first hours of Hamas' bloody attack on border villages. At least 212 people were taken hostage; two Americans were released Friday in what Hamas described as a humanitarian gesture. The Gaza Health Ministry put the Palestinian death toll at 4,385; almost two-thirds of the fatalities are children and women. More than 1,000 people have been reported missing and are feared trapped or dead under the rubble.
Israel repeated its calls Sunday for Palestinians to leave northern Gaza. Israeli authorities say an estimated 700,000 have already fled, but hundreds of thousands remain. Fleeing to southern Gaza has provided little relief as Israeli airstrikes there have also battered cities and infrastructure. Gaza's Housing Ministry says more than 160,000 homes and apartments − more than 40% of all dwellings − in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the war began two weeks ago.
The result is that about 1.4 million of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been "internally displaced," and 566,000 of them are staying in U.N. emergency shelters, the U.N. says.
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, and several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for the establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material, and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.

A prominent Detroit synagogue board president was found stabbed to death early Saturday outside her home. Police have yet to identify a motive or a suspect in her killing.
Samantha Woll, 40, was found outside her home in a neighborhood east of downtown Detroit. She was the board president of Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue, worked for Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin and was on the reelection campaign of Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, also a Democrat.
Religious leaders and public officials decried the killing.
The American Jewish Committee said it was "heartbroken" at the news, calling her a "ray of sunlight to all who knew her" and "a passionate Muslim-Jewish bridge builder." Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan recalled meeting with Woll during a dedication of a renovated synagogue, a project he said she led "with great pride and enthusiasm."
U.S. Rep Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who is Palestinian American and Muslim and represents Detroit, posted on Facebook: "My friend, and a member of our organizing community, Sam Woll, was murdered. I have no words. She always had a sweet smile to offer and the warmest eyes to greet you. Our community is devastated and we are shocked. Please keep her family and our community in your prayers."
Detroit Police offered no clarity about the motive behind the killing by the end of the day, but Chief James White said Saturday night the department was continuing to investigate.
"Understandably, this crime leaves many unanswered questions," he said in a statement. "This matter is under investigation, and I am asking that everyone remain patient while investigators carefully examine every aspect of the available evidence. It is important that no conclusions be drawn until all of the available facts are reviewed."
Earlier, Detroit police said they were investigating a report that a woman had been found unresponsive, with multiple stab wounds, in the 1300 block of Joliet Place in the city's Lafayette Park neighborhood. A trail of blood led back to the victim's home, where police said they believe the crime occurred.
Officials pronounced Woll dead at the scene.
The FBI was aware of the case and has been assisting Detroit police as requested, said Gabrielle Szlenkier, a spokesperson for the FBI's Detroit field office, in an email. The FBI referred all questions to local police.
Woll led the synagogue's board since 2022 and was involved in other local Jewish organizations. A statement sent by Rabbi Ariana Silverman said the synagogue was "shocked and saddened," by Woll's "unexpected death."
"At this point, we do not have more information," the statement said, "but will share more when it becomes available. May her memory be a blessing."
Woll spent much of her career in state and local politics, working on or managing campaigns of Nessel, state Sen. Stephanie Chang, and Denzel McCampbell, who ran for Detroit City Clerk and others.
Chang and Woll attended a wedding together the night before Woll's body was found, and was photographed smiling alongside the bride and groom. Chang and Woll met as students at the University of Michigan more than 15 years ago and remained friends.
"A lot of good" things were happening in Woll's life, Chang said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press. In addition to leading the reopening and renovation of the downtown synagogue, she was poised to get a new job.
"She was endlessly positive, just a wonderful person who was doing so much good and could bring so much happiness and joy," Chang said.
Democratic state Rep. Noah Arbit posted on Facebook he was "broken and unable to move" at the news of Woll's murder. He said she was the kindest and most beautiful soul taken away in "the most evil, brutal way.
"Sam was committed to justice and equality. In her name we will never give up. Baruch Dayan Emet, Sam. You were so loved and cherished."
Sloktin posted a tribute on her official Facebook page saying Woll sought to bring people together and cared deeply about helping others.
"Separately, in politics & in the Jewish community, she dedicated her short life to building understanding across faiths, bringing light in the face of darkness," the congresswoman wrote.
Woll will be missed, Sloktin wrote, for her desire to serve and the bright smile she brought across the Detroit area.
“I am shocked, saddened and horrified to learn of Sam’s brutal murder,” Nessel said in a statement posted on X. “Sam was as kind a person as I’ve ever known. She was driven by her sincere love of her community, state and country. Sam truly used her faith and activism to create a better place for everyone.”
Woll, who previously worked in constituent relations for Chang, was selected as one of The Detroit Jewish News' "36 under 36" in 2017.
According to the outlet, Woll helped lead the American Jewish Committee’s ACCESS Detroit Young Leadership Program and founded the Muslim-Jewish Forum of Detroit, a grassroots organization aimed to build relationships between young adults of those faiths.
"By extending her hand and creating space for connection between Muslims and Jews, she has exemplified the values of healing the world," The Detroit Jewish News article said.
PHOENIX — It was like a professional sumo wrestler strolling into an all-you-can-eat Brazilian steak house and ordering a salad.
It was like seeing a Ferrari going 50 mph on the Autobahn.
It was spending the evening with Kevin Hart without cracking a smile.
It was the powerful Philadelphia Phillies stunning everyone in the house Saturday night at Chase Field with a sneak attack that even had their own players scratching their head.
“I couldn’t believe it,’’ Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto said. “I was shocked.’’
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
The Phillies dismantled the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-1, taking a 3-2 lead in the National League Championship Series. The D-backs are still trying to figure out what hit them.
Sure, the Phillies still showed off their muscle, hitting three home runs, two within seven pitches for a total of 905 feet.
Zack Wheeler again showed why he was one of the best free-agent signings in all of baseball, impersonating Roy Halladay in a dominant performance when the Phillies bullpen was in shambles.
Still, the play that left everyone gasping for air occurred right out of the gate in the first inning, completely changing the complexion of the NLCS.
It began with Kyle Schwarber, who led off the game with a 45-foot dribbler for a base hit. He couldn’t stop laughing as he ran to first. Bryce Harper followed with a single one batter later, and with two outs, Schwarber scored on Bryson Stott’s two-out single. Schwarber, who hit a 461-foot homer in the sixth inning, had barely even touched third base when right fielder Corbin Carroll fielded the ball, but he gambled by running home, and scored easily.
It set up the play of the night, if not the series.
Realmuto, at the plate, watched Stott take off from first base trying to steal second, quickly turned to his left, and saw Harper charging towards the plate.
They were attempting a rare double steal.
“From the start of the playoffs, sort of the message to everybody was, 'Let's put pressure on people,'" Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. “That doesn't mean the double steals. It also means getting down the line, putting pressure on people with ground balls, putting pressure on the outfield … forcing them to maybe make some mistakes.’’
The execution was perfect. Diamondbacks catcher Gabriel Moreno got the pitch from Zac Gallen, stood up and fired to second base, but Stott stopped. D-backs second baseman Ketel Marte grabbed the ball and fired home, but it bounced in front of Moreno. Harper crashed into Moreno's left shoulder, and scored.
And just like that, the Phillies had their first steal of home in a postseason game in franchise history.
The Phillies, without hitting a home run or even producing an extra-base hit, had a 2-0 lead, and Harper became the oldest player to steal home in a postseason game since the great Jackie Robinson. Sure, it wasn’t a straight steal of home like Robinson’s in Game 1 of the 1955 World Series, but it counted just the same.
“We're going to be aggressive right here,’’ said Harper, who would later hit a 441-foot homer in the sixth inning. “Bryson had the green light. He went, and i just tried to make the best decision to get there and make it happen to score that run...
“You know, baseball play. Big collision at the plate. But just a good position to put us in.’’
It was just what the Phillies needed after watching their bullpen blow the last two games. They have their swagger back just in time for a trip to Citizens Bank Park where they have the biggest home-field advantage in baseball.
“It was a risky play because they have a really good catcher and really good infielders that make that play probably seven out of 10 times at least,’’ Realmuto said. “We just got lucky they didn’t make a good throw back to the plate.
“But what they did to us the last two games, coming back, they had all of the momentum in the world, and we had to try to do something early in the game to get it back.’’
The double steal, called by third base coach Dusty Wathan, gave Stott the option of trying to steal second. If he went, Harper was instructed to take off. If Moreno doesn’t throw down, the Phillies have two runners in scoring position. If Stott is thrown out, the worst that happens is that Realmuto leads off the next inning.
Yet, it was executed to perfection.
“If Bryce doesn’t run right when he’s supposed to,’’ Stott said, “he’s thrown out. Last year, I ran the same play (against the Mets), and I was thrown out by 10 feet. It’s a big-time play.
“There’s a lot of stuff that has to go right so it’s tough on the defense. He’s got to make a good throw to second, a good throw back to home, he’s got to tag him. He ran it perfect for us.’’
It turned out the Diamondbacks didn’t make one good throw, and you better believe that when they take the field to work out Sunday at Citizens Bank Park, defending the double steal will be on the agenda.
“We work on that a lot,’’ D-backs manager Torey Lovullo says. “I think if we just play pitch and catch, and he drives the throw into home plate and gives Gaby a chance to catch that ball, and lay the tag down on Harper, he is out by eight, 10 feet.
“The play didn't surprise us. We were anticipating it. It was well-timed by our guys. We just didn't finish the play.’’
Whether the D-backs were caught off guard or not, the double steal immediately gave the Phillies momentum, allowed them to forget the nightmare of the last two nights, and put all of the pressure on the D-backs.
“That was massive,’’ said Schwarber, who now has 20 postseason home runs in 63 postseason games, tied for fourth all-time with Hall of Famer Derek Jeter. “You can’t understate how big it was to be able to score first to get those runs across, and let Wheeler do his thing.’’
And, oh, did Wheeler come through at a time the Phillies desperately needed it.
“You can't say enough about him,’’ Harper said. “I told him after the game, like, 'You're one of the best pitchers I've ever played with, man.' I've played with a lot of good ones, and he's easily top three.
“It's incredible what he does. It's so much fun to watch. I love playing behind him. It’s incredible. He's legit, man.’’
Certainly, the timing was impeccable. The Phillies’ bullpen was exhausted, using 11 relievers in the last two games to combine for 26 outs. Wheeler came out and absolutely dominated. He pitched seven innings, giving up six hits while striking out eight, leaving with a 6-1 lead.
“You're definitely thinking about it coming into the game,’’ Wheeler said. “I know the bullpen was taxed a little bit, so I needed to go deep, and obviously I wanted that to be quality innings. So, I was able to do that, and save the bullpen a little bit.’’
He might have also saved their season with the Phillies now going home, where they have the greatest postseason winning percentage in baseball history, just one game from a return trip to the World Series — and perhaps a rematch against the defending champion Astros.
If it happens, it would be the first World Series rematch since 1977-1978, when the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees met.
“If we were to make it there, and they make it there,’’ Wheeler said, “it'd be pretty cool. It's really hard to do, making it to the World Series, so two teams to make it there back-to-back would be pretty awesome.’’

Gwyneth Paltrow has been offering lifestyle advice for more than a decade, but don't expect her to escort you into old age. The Oscar-winning actress says she may just disappear from public life when the time comes to sell her lifestyle and health company Goop.
The company, which she founded in 2008, is not for sale right now, however when she does sell it, "I will literally disappear from public life," Paltrow said in a wide-ranging interview in the magazine Bustle.
But can't Paltrow, who is 51, hang around and help show folks how to make it to their 70s and 80s "with grace," asked interviewer Emma Rosenblum, who's also the chief content officer for media company BDG, which publishes Bustle.
"I’ll probably try, knowing myself," Paltrow said. "Or … I might just disappear, and no one will ever see me again."

The Bustle interview is timed to the arrival of Paltrow's new skincare line Good. Clean. Goop., which launches on Amazon and Target on Sunday, Oct. 22.
The lower-priced line of skincare and wellness brands launched under Goop Beauty features "clinically proven beauty products" like moisturizers, exfoliating scrubs, and shampoos, according to a press release.
Paltrow said the decision to sell in Target came after many conversations with the company and her familiarity with the business. And Amazon, too, is a plus because it makes the product even more accessible. "I think of it as us being able to offer something that can be more broadly consumed," Paltrow told Bustle.
Read about Gwyneth Paltrow Trial:The Gwyneth Paltrow ski trial has our attention. It's strange, juicy and exactly what the internet wanted.
When the Bustle interview shifted to her social media habit, Paltrow said she does not keep up with social media. "I end up muting a lot of things. I don't know, I find it hard. I wish I could not be on it, but simultaneously, you want to understand what's happening," said Paltrow. "Then, of course, I need it for work, and they always make me do these stupid things on it."
Paltrow, who won the best actress Oscar in 1999 for her role in "Shakespeare in Love," has also performed well on Instagram where she has 8.3 million followers and, famously, posed in her birthday suit on the site for her birthday in 2020.
Speaking of birthdays, the interviewer then commented on how Paltrow could perhaps make her exit around her 55th birthday, which led to another mention about disappearing. "I'd be happy with that," said Paltrow. "I will disappear from public life. No one will ever see me again."
But she's not quite ready to vamoose just yet, especially because it's her responsibility to keep Goop in the public eye, Paltrow said. "We're not ready to sell yet. I need a few more years."
As for the new Goop offshoot at Amazon and Target, Paltrow told Bustle, "I just hope people really like it and try it."
Michigan State University has issued an apology after Adolf Hitler was featured in a pregame trivia segment displayed on the Spartan Stadium scoreboard ahead of the Spartans' 49-0 blowout loss to in-state rival Michigan on Saturday.
Hitler was featured in a pregame trivia segment that asked fans where the German dictator was born, according to many photos circulating on social media. Michigan State confirmed Saturday night that Hitler was displayed in the pregame segment the school says was created by a third party.
"MSU is aware that inappropriate content by a third-party source was displayed on the videoboard prior to the start of tonight’s football game," the university said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports. "We are deeply sorry for the content that was displayed, as this is not representative of our institutional values."
The university said it will no longer work with the third-party source that approved the content and "will implement stronger screening and approval procedures for all videoboard content in the future."
The pregame quiz featuring an image of Hitler coincides with a spike in antisemitism amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Less than 90 miles away from Spartan Stadium, a prominent Detroit synagogue board president was found stabbed to death outside her home early Saturday. 
It also marks the latest controversy for Michigan State after football coach Mel Tucker was fired after an investigation into a sexual harassment complaint was reported by USA TODAY.
As we can see in Ukraine and now the Middle East, wars of aggression, acts of genocide, tyranny and terrorist atrocities do not happen in isolation.
From the seeds of a strong-arm regime in Germany, sprouted with virulent antisemitism, came the continentwide extermination of Jews. The shadows of the Holocaust loom large, with contemporary Western society constructed upon the principle of "never again." Yet, disturbingly, echoes of the past resurface as Jewish populations face vile antisemitism in Europe and America, and calls for "peace" mask veiled justifications for Hamas' heinous acts, which, at their core, revel in cruelty and degradation.
The Soviet Union's oppressive legacy endures. Bosnian genocide, Yugoslav wars, poverty, oligarchism, Russian invasions of Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine – all of these didn’t happen out of nowhere. Countless individuals, particularly in Eastern Europe and notably Ukraine, grapple with fractured family histories and tales of ancestors deported, killed or incarcerated. Such generational trauma requires immense time and understanding to be fully addressed and healed. 
The Syrian war, with its novel brand of horror, did not emerge spontaneously. The alliance between Hezbollah, a notorious Lebanese terrorist entity, and Russia, which at that point was a widely accepted partner of the free world, started in 2015 in Syria and has not stopped.
Now, the repercussions of every past atrocity reverberate globally. The same culprits, repeatedly emboldened, perpetrate murder, torture and degradation as the world seeks reassurance and the illusion of peace.
Hamas, responsible for the deaths of entire Israeli families, finds camaraderie in Moscow. Syria's Assad regime deploys chemical warfare on its populace, bolstered by Hezbollah and Russia. Hezbollah launches assaults on Israel, underpinned by its intricate ties with Iran, Syria and Russia.
Russia's savage invasion of Ukraine persists, with Iranians providing applause and weaponry. African nations are inundated with propaganda, giving a stage to ruthless Russian mercenaries – while China quietly acquires the continent piece by piece. And China's menacing stance toward Taiwan, combined with its support for Russia's aggression toward Ukraine, signals a broader threat to the free world.
This vicious cycle offers no genuine peace. 
Ukraine working to document war crimes:Ukrainians need America's help to hold Russian war criminals accountable for atrocities
Regrettably, the free world isn't merely an idle observer. Much of the technology utilized by Russia and terrorist factions originates in the West.
Billions in humanitarian aid have flowed into Gaza, only to line the pockets of Hamas leaders living lavishly in Qatar or to finance militants who funnel these funds into weapon smuggling. European aid items, including water pipes, have been repurposed by Hamas to fashion missiles aimed at Israel. 
Microelectronics are incorporated into missiles that wreak havoc upon civilians in Ukraine and anywhere else terrorists enact their terror. Despite bans, embargoes and sanctions on international companies, Russia continues to utilize Western tools to manufacture advanced weaponry – the very same machines that still benefit from maintenance by their manufacturers, such as German-Japanese DMG Mori or American Haas Automation.
Why do these companies persist in servicing equipment instrumental in aiding a nation led by an accused war criminal to produce arms? Greed appears to be the likeliest culprit. Such convenient "ignorance" of the end-users (Russian arms manufacturers) does not make an excuse for silent war crimes enablers.
To those who argue that Europe or the United States should abstain from intervening in distant conflicts, a sobering reality check is due: Their involvement is already apparent, just not in a way most of the people imagine. This is evidenced by the surging exports to nations that orbit Russia – for instance, German exports to Kyrgyzstan soared by 949% last year, according to a Reuters analysis, with a significant proportion finding its way to Russia.
Moreover, the inability to curtail purchases of Russian resources, such as the U.S. acquisition of uranium from Rosatom, effectively bankrolls the adversary's military operations.
Concurrently, China capitalizes on its position as the manufacturing hub for Western tech, striving to replicate and pilfer Western innovations. 
Stop following China.United Nations is ruled by 'we the peoples,' not authoritarian regimes.
The sobering truth is that countries such as China, Iran, Belarus and Russia are already waging a covert war against the free world, and it's high time the latter acknowledged this reality and stopped fighting against itself.
True global tranquility remains elusive until the world recognizes that witnessing brutality is never a standalone event. The civilizational war has started, and it’s time for all to choose their allegiance.

Famed sportscaster Jim Nantz offered golfers playing Pebble Beach a legendary opportunity, offering to provide play-by-play for a group of golfers teeing off on the famously short seventh hole, a 109-yard Par 3.
The video was posted to the cameraman Jason Deaver's TikTok account, @jdprogolf. Deaver is currently attempting to become a professional golfer. He holds a +2 handicap at the moment. The video was actually taken about a month and a half ago, Deaver told USA Today. It was Deaver's first time at Pebble Beach, and the group he was caddying for got VIP treatment.

According to Deaver, Nantz was "showing the course to his friends from out of town" when he pulled up in his cart to the seventh tee. Nobody asked him to provide play-by-play either. That was entirely Nantz's idea.
"He said to me, 'Why don't you pull out your phone real quick? I want to do something,'" said Deaver. "It kind of became an iconic little moment for everybody. Under that pressure, I'm not sure I could put it on the green."
The man who hit the green was another golfer that was put in Deaver's group, David Lorenz. Regardless, Nantz offered background commentary for multiple people in that group according to Deaver, but only went full broadcaster mode for David's tee shot. That just so happened to be the best shot of the bunch. According to Deaver, every other shot from the group failed to hit the green.
"I would say that was one of Lorenz's best shots of the day," Deaver claimed. "He had about two or three birdies that day, so he didn't play terrible golf. I would probably say that was the shot of his life though." Deaver continued, "He was totally on top of the world. He couldn't believe it."
Even though Lorenz had the best shot of the bunch, Deaver claimed that it was impossible to be upset after that interaction happened. Said Deaver, "The rest of the day, you can't get mad at anything after that happening, you know?"
While Deaver would not consider himself a friend or acquaintance of Nantz, he told USA Today that he has met Nantz a few times before. "He's a great guy," says Deaver, "one of the nicest guys you could ever meet."
Nantz's children play junior golf with Deaver's college golf coach. "I've met him a few times through that, because I help out with that." Deaver explained further, "So, yeah, I've seen him before, and he's always been a really good human being and always taken his time to have a conversation with you when he doesn't have to."
It costs around $600 for a single tee time at Pebble Beach. There are additional fees that come too though if you or anyone in your group wants a caddy or cart. That's a lot, but Pebble Beach is regarded as one of the nicest courses in America. So, this begs the question, "How much more would you be willing to pay to have your entire round narrated by Jim Nantz?"
"I don't know if I'd pay a whole lot," said Deaver. "It'd be an awesome experience, but my money right now goes to tournament golf. I would definitely think people would pay thousands and thousands of dollars to have that happen. I would think people would pay thousands just to hit that one shot."
Deaver, Lorenz, and company got that opportunity for free, an all-time cool move from Nantz.

For the last four decades, invasive Burmese python snakes have terrorized mammals and the greater ecosystem of the Everglades National Park and throughout South Florida.
Now, a recent study shows what is biting back.
The Southeast Asian apex predator can grow up to 19 feet long, weigh more than 150 pounds and eat everything from rabbits to deer. The pythons and their appetites are also blamed for the disappearance of almost all the fur-bearing mammals in the Everglades and surrounding areas.
A new study by the U.S. Geological Survey and partner organizations in Florida studied the deaths of 19 baby Burmese pythons from May 2021 to February 2022 to see how this part of the python population might meet its fate.
Burmese pythons are difficult to track or monitor, according to Mark Sandfoss, Biologist at Fort Collins Science Center stationed in Everglades National Park. But studies like this provide data points to fill in the gaps of their life cycle.
"It takes a lot of time and effort to collect these data," Sandfoss said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY. "We need more information and are continuing to track juvenile pythons in Southern Florida to understand their ecology, particularly movement, habitat use, and survival."
Burmese pythons:Latest hunt netted over 200 of the invasive species in the Everglades
Burmese pythons are native to Southeast Asia. They were imported to Florida to be sold to pet owners, and were likely released or escaped. They established a wild population in the 1980s, according to the study, and Sandfoss said they can grow to be 19 feet long and weigh more than 150 pounds.
Since then, they have wreaked havoc on the natural environment, eating everything from rabbits to deer with few species being able to check the population. The USGS estimates there are tens of thousands living in the Everglades.
A 2012 study showed that pythons' diets have drastically cut the populations of Everglades-area mammals. Raccoon, opossum and bobcat populations had dropped 85%-99%, and rabbits and foxes had "effectively disappeared."
Humans may be one known predator of the python, but the recent USGS study shows there are more, at least for the babies.

Juvenile Burmese pythons were opportunistically collected throughout more than a year. They were implanted with high-frequency radio transmitters equipped with mortality sensors that notified researches when the snake stopped moving for 24 hours.
During the length of the study, 19 baby snakes died. At that point, scientists would go to the scene of the crime and conduct some detective work to discover the cause of death.
Here is what they found:
Among the deceased juveniles recorded as part of the study, one ambitious snake set a new record for pythons that size. It attempted to eat a hispid cotton rat that weighed 106% of the python's body weight.
The study says this is notable in more ways than one. Its failure to accurately assess prey could be a sign of a maladaptive behaviors due to different prey sizes in the new environment compared to their native environment.
Maladaptive behaviors provide scientists the opportunity to identify potential weaknesses in an invasive species that have otherwise thrived in a new environment, Sandfoss said. While maladaptive behaviors are naturally selected out of the population overtime, the native species can also adapt to the invasive species in that time.
Sandfoss said that, given the wide range of prey that adult pythons eat, scientists did no know if native species had learned to adapt to avoid becoming prey or even become a predator.
He said that the range of predators they found in the study was a pleasant surprise. A cottonmouth snake, for example, would never be able to eat an adult python, but did consume one of the juveniles in the study.
Sandfoss also said that this data is part of a long journey to understand the Burmese python's life cycle in Florida to better aid their population mitigation strategies.
"Our role as scientists is to try to tip the scales in the direction of the native species and identify the weaknesses of the invasive species that we can exploit for management purposes," he said.

Spoiler alert! This story includes detailed plot points of the new movie "Killers of the Flower Moon" and the real-life events on which it's based.
The new Martin Scorsese movie “Killers of the Flower Moon” plays like an improbable human horror story, brimming with deceit and death in 1920s Oklahoma.
The 3-hour-and 26-minute film, starring Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone, tells the story of Osage Nation tribal members, newly wealthy from the discovery of oil on their otherwise parched reservation lands, and the duplicitous non-Native Americans who swoop in to steal their bounty.
But while it plays like an allegory, the story is true. Based on the best-selling 2017 book by journalist David Grann, “Killers” is the result of years of research and interviews with Osage elders. The tale explored both the deaths surrounding the family of Mollie Burkhart (Gladstone) as well as the exploits of the nascent Federal Bureau of Investigation.
USA TODAY spoke with Grann to get details on how the movie compares with his book.
“Absolutely,” says Grann. “Because of the vast oil deposits on their lands, by the 1920s the Osage were among the wealthiest people per capita in the world.”
People of the Osage Nation had been moved around by the federal government for years before winding up in a barren stretch of Oklahoma, which wasn’t worth much at the turn of the 20th century. But when oil deposits were discovered, everything changed.
Grann says that in 1923, with roughly 2,000 people on the tribal rolls, the group “collectively got more than $30 million (in payments from oil companies leasing their land),” which translates to about $500 million in today's dollars. And while “few Americans owned a car at that time, many Osage had numerous cars, as well as many servants, often white.”
‘Maybe we’re all capable of this’:Martin Scorsese on ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ movie
Grann says at least 24 Osage tribal members were murdered in order to get their oil rights, so-called “headrights.” A typical way to get these rights was marrying into an Osage family. But as the book and movie explain, sometimes there were shootings or slow poisonings to make the deaths look like mysterious ailments.
While the “Killers” movie focuses on the evil schemes of one man, William Hale (DeNiro), and his hapless nephew Ernest Burkhart (DiCaprio), “the real murders were less about a singular plot or evil figure with henchmen, but rather many killings that were never properly investigated. Many people were complicit: Doctors with their poison, morticians covering up causes of death, lawmen staying silent. Many conclude the real death toll was in the scores, if not hundreds.”
Not likely, says Grann. “There is no evidence that I know of that Mollie spoke to the president about the murders,” he says. “But it needs to be underscored that the Osage did go to Washington, D.C., and she might have been on a trip.”
Grann says Burkhart, as the movie shows, was so distraught by the deaths of her sisters that she “vigorously campaigned for justice, offering testimony when needed and hiring private detectives to help find the killers.”
In 1921, a young J. Edgar Hoover, who would wind up as the notorious and longstanding director of the FBI, took over a new office then simply called the Bureau of Investigation. Hoover was eager to put his new group on the political map, so he eagerly dispatched a former Texas Ranger, Tom White (Jesse Plemons) to Oklahoma to investigate the mysterious Osage murders after local law enforcement hadn't solved the case.
“This was among the first big complex homicide investigations by the fledgling Bureau of Investigation, which would become the FBI,” says Grann. “At the time, this office had limited jurisdiction over crimes nationally, but it did have jurisdiction over crimes on federal (Native American) lands.”
Grann adds that thanks in part to this case, laws were passed in the 1930s that gave the FBI greater reach.
“There was something unquestionably evil about Hale, at his core,” says Grann. “According to the records he did show no remorse. He had created and was reflective of a pathological ideology of western expansionism, a boosterism and a conviction' that the Native American way of life was ending. world was going.”
Hale served his time and died at 87 in Arizona in 1962.
Our critic says:In 'Killers of the Flower Moon,' Martin Scorsese crafts a gripping story of love, murder
At the end of Scorsese’s “Killers,” the director makes a cameo appearance as an actor in a Lucky Strike cigarette-sponsored radio play about the Osage murders, years after the case was closed..
Grann says the story was the subject of a radio play, but its purpose was less about sharing outrage of the treatment of Native Americans as glorifying the FBI's work.
“Hoover wanted it to burnish his and the Bureau’s reputation, so he organized these propagandistic retellings of what happened,” says Grann. “The scene in the movie is getting at the issue of how history is recorded, and often misrecorded. Sure, Hoover closed the case, but there was a deep conspiracy surrounding the murders that the Bureau never exposed.”
Ohio State's defense blanketed Penn State to deliver a 20-12 win in one of the most important games of the regular season.
Five years after James Franklin promised the Nittany Lions would eventually graduate to join the top teams in the Bowl Subdivision, the loss reinforces the program's place: Penn State is very good, but not elite. The Nittany Lions are treading water.
And Ohio State is finding new ways to win games in the Big Ten. Clearly influenced by back-to-back losses to Michigan, the Buckeyes are a physical team defined more so by defensive excellence than by an offense that has top-end skill talent but has taken a noticeable step back from the past two seasons.
Penn State failed to convert a single third-down attempt until there was under a minute left. The Nittany Lions averaged just 2.6 yards per attempt on 25 carries. Drew Allar hit on just 18 of 43 throws for 191 yards, an average of 4.3 yards per pass. A significant portion of his yardage and lone touchdown came on his team's final drive after Ohio State held a 14-point lead.
The Buckeyes' failed fourth-down attempt on the goal line and a turnover on special teams gave Penn State chances to draw even in the second half. When in similar situations in the recent past, Ohio State has pulled away from the Nittany Lions with pure offensive firepower. But the seventh win in a row in this series was sparked by a defense that may be one of the most improved units in the FBS. After Saturday, the Buckeyes are giving up just 3.9 yards per play.
This level of stinginess has been enough to offset a hit-or-miss offense that thrives when delivering the ball to All-America wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr., who had 11 receptions for 162 yards and a touchdown. Going up against the Nittany Lions' own stout defense, the Buckeyes managed to run for 79 yards while Kyle McCord went 23 of 35 for 286 yards.
The win sets up a breezy four-game run before meeting the Wolverines to end November. Next, Ohio State goes to Wisconsin and Rutgers before returning home for Michigan State and Minnesota. This monthlong stretch will give Ryan Day and the Buckeyes' offense more time to develop before heading into the winner-take-all rivalry game in Ann Arbor.
The immediate future is hazier for Penn State. This was an incredible opportunity to end a long losing streak against an Ohio State that has clear flaws relative to the program's recent standard. With the loss, the Nittany Lions are once again no better than a New Year's Six participant with Michigan still to come in November. The disappointment is palpable.
The Buckeyes and Nittany Lions top Saturday's biggest winners and losers:
Basically buried after losing to Texas and struggling to put away South Florida in September, Alabama has put together a series of close victories culminating in a 34-20 win against Tennessee to climb right back into the College Football Playoff race. Like earlier wins against Mississippi, Arkansas and others, beating Tennessee required a toned-down offense built around quarterback Jalen Milroe, who completed 14 of 21 attempts for 220 yards and two scores with an interception. Down 20-7 at halftime, the Crimson Tide outscored the Volunteers 27-0 in the second half to avenge last year's shootout loss. There are fewer style points than in the past but the results in league play have been familiar: Alabama is weighing teams down with a strong defense and doing a better job protecting the football while finding explosive plays downfield. And while the flash is missing, the Crimson Tide have shown extreme mental toughness in weathering the early-season swoon to look like Georgia's biggest threat in the SEC.
Florida State got 330 yards of total offense from quarterback Jordan Travis and remained unbeaten with a closer-than-it-looks 38-20 win against Duke. Riley Leonard was back in the the lineup for the Blue Devils, but he struggled to get things going through the air even before leaving the game in the third quarter after apparently reinjuring the ankle he hurt in last month's close loss to Notre Dame. But the game turned at the moment Leonard left: FSU trailed 21-17 when Leonard went down but was in total control from that point forward. While Duke continues to impress even in defeat, the Seminoles managed to pull out another resourceful win against one of the top teams in the ACC and remain on track for a conference championship game appearance and potential playoff berth.
Missouri is good. Not win-the-SEC good, obviously, but this is a very improved team that is playing the best football to date under coach Eli Drinkwitz. The Tigers are now 7-1 after dispatching South Carolina, taking a 24-3 lead at halftime and then sleepwalking through the second half to win 34-12. Missouri's defense did a nice job with Spencer Rattler, limiting him to just 5.4 yards per attempt, while the offense drew 159 yards and two touchdowns from running back Cody Schrader and a team-leading 90 receiving yards from potential All-America pick Luther Burden. Up next are Georgia, Tennessee and Florida, as Missouri prepares for meaningful November football for the first time in several years.
Matt Rhule has Nebraska pointed toward bowl play after another strong performance from a rejuvenated defense sparked a 17-9 win against Northwestern. Now 4-3, the Cornhuskers will have chances to get to six wins against a very friendly home stretch of games — Purdue, Michigan State, Maryland, Wisconsin and Iowa — and could conceivably make the Big Ten title game. While deeply flawed team from an offensive perspective — the whole offense is taped together with sticks and branches, making every positive gain an absolute adventure — that Nebraska could end the longest bowl drought in the Power Five in Rhule's first season would be an achievement that breathes enormous life into the program heading into 2024.
Kansas State was all over TCU from the opening whistle of a 41-3 win that's probably the Wildcats' most complete performance of the season. While two tough setbacks against Missouri and Oklahoma State have knocked them out of the Top 25, the Wildcats have moments when they look like one of two or three best teams in the Big 12 — Saturday being one of them. Kansas State continues to use a very interesting two-quarterback rotation of upperclassman Will Howard and true freshman Avery Johnson, with the pair combining for 244 yards and four touchdowns without an interception with another 135 yards on the ground. Coach Chris Kleiman may have steered his team throughout a rough patch and pointed the Wildcats back toward the conference championship game.
Saturday's loss drops Franklin to 1-9 against Ohio State and 4-15 combined against the Buckeyes and Michigan, the Nittany Lions' opponent on Nov. 11. For all of the program's wins, major-bowl appearances and overall success, there is a sense of missed chances and unrealized expectations that grows even stronger with every successive failure against the best of the best in the Big Ten. The Nittany Lions could end up with double-digit wins but losing to the Buckeyes and Wolverines would only be a reminder of how far the program still has to go before truly competing for national championships.
Another week, another awful loss. And unlike last week's blowout defeat at Notre Dame, this one came at home and featured more traditional heartbreak: Utah drove 54 yards in the final 1:46 and made a 38-yard field goal as time expired to beat Southern California 34-32. Quarterback Bryson Barnes had 235 passing yards, four total touchdowns and a crucial scramble on the final drive to offset Caleb Williams' 256 passing yards and one rushing score. While this was a better performance overall than against the Fighting Irish and one that saw more moments of effectiveness from the USC defense, these two losses in a row have caused the floor to give way for the Trojans, and this year could get even worse with games ahead against Oregon, Washington and UCLA.
There was always this sense that unbeaten North Carolina was living on borrowed time. And then Drake Maye would throw for 350 yards and three scores to lift the Tar Heels to another high-scoring win. Luck finally ran out against an unexpected opponent, Virginia, which captured the biggest win of coach Tony Elliott's tenure by controlling the ball and keeping Maye on the sidelines in a a 31-27 upset. The Cavaliers had possession for more than 37 minutes and ran the ball 54 times for 228 yards, offsetting the production of a UNC offense that still had 26 first downs and nearly 500 yards despite the limited touches.
Clemson continues to drift toward its worst season since 2010 after a 28-20 overtime loss to Miami. The Tigers turned the ball over three times, had a nonexistent running game and were still in position to win this game late into the fourth quarter, only to allow the game-tying field goal with under two minutes left and fail to punch it in from inches away from the end zone in the second overtime. The win basically saves Miami’s season at a possible breaking point after losses to Georgia Tech and North Carolina, and should temporarily quiet the increased scrutiny around coach Mario Cristobal. The loss is a devastating one for Clemson, essentially ending any hope of regaining the ACC crown and officially signaling a second year in a row out of the playoff.
This is the worst team in the SEC West and the worst offense in the SEC, and that's combined to leave Sam Pittman on some shaky ground heading into the final four games of the regular season. You can write off any legitimate shot at the postseason after a 7-3 loss to Mississippi State, the Razorbacks' sixth loss in a row and worst of the bunch. An way-too-empty stadium reflects the current state of affairs: Arkansas has gone from trendy to a total bore under Pittman.
It was fun and games when Iowa was winning. But the jokes and eyerolls at the state of Iowa's offense will become a more serious concern after a 12-10 loss to Minnesota that saw the Hawkeyes deliver just 127 yards and fail to win despite keeping the Golden Gophers out of the end zone. Even worse, the potential game-winning touchdown on a punt return from Cooper DeJean with under two minutes left was taken off the board after officials ruled DeJean had a made a fair-catch signal. One week after the Hawkeyes had seemed to put a headlock on the Big Ten West with a win against Wisconsin, the division is back up for grabs.
Wake Forest faced Pittsburgh without its starting quarterback and his backup, leaving Dave Clawson to the turn the offense over to redshirt sophomore Santino Marucci, whose career experience before Saturday consisted of six garbage-time snaps against Norfolk State two years ago, all on special teams. You know exactly where this going. The Panthers were up 17-14 with 1:30 left after a 75-yard touchdown drive and then intercepted Marucci with just over a minute left. Even after punting back to Wake Forest only 23 seconds later, Pittsburgh needed just one last defensive stop to secure a second win in a row. But Marucci marched the Demon Deacons 48 yards in 33 seconds, connecting with Cameron Hite on a 15-yard score with seven seconds left, to hand out the Panthers' worst loss in what has been a brutal season.
FORT DODGE, Iowa — Allison Roderick has a warning and a pledge for rural residents of her county: The water from their wells could be contaminated, but the government can help make it safe.
Roderick is the environmental health officer for Webster County in north-central Iowa, where a few thousand rural residents live among sprawling corn and soybean fields. Many draw their water from private wells, which are exempt from most federal testing and purity regulations. Roderick spreads the word that they aren’t exempt from danger.
A former Connecticut postmaster could face 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to defrauding the U.S. Postal Service of $875,000 through bribery and embezzlement schemes.
Ephrem D. Nguyen, a postmaster for a postal office in Danbury, Connecticut pleaded guilty on Oct. 13 to multiple schemes involving using USPS credit cards to pay a vendor about at least $760,000 more than necessary for maintenance and repair work, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Additionally, he said he embezzled over $80,000 with credit cards to rent vehicles for personal use and approved fraudulent travel expense reimbursement claims exceeding $8,000 for a co-worker.
The former employee's work responsibilities included supervising maintenance and repair for USPS equipment, facilities and vehicles.

In late 2020, Nguyen required that all maintenance and repair for the postal services go through a specific vendor despite knowing another vendor had been contracted for the office, the news release states. He also demanded the vendor provide free vehicle maintenance and repairs for himself, a co-worker, one of his children and an employee of Nguyen's personal business.
In 2022, the former employee asked for and received $90,000 from the same vendor through cash bribes causing USPS to overpay the vendor for vehicle service that he called a "raise," according to the news release.
The accumulation of these defrauding schemes adds to about $874,930.59, the release states.
"As federal employees, we take an oath to protect the public, including funds that have been allocated for federal services,” U.S. Attorney Avery said in the release. "This corrupt employee operated a brazen bribery, kickback, and embezzlement scheme that defrauded the U.S. Postal Service of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  I commend the USPS Office of Inspector General and the FBI for their excellent work in this investigation."
The federal public defender representing Nguyen has declined requests for comment, according to the Associated Press.
"The public must have confidence that Postal Service employees will conduct their work in an honest manner," Kenneth Cleevely, a Special Agent for USPS' Inspector General, said in the news release.
Nguyen was released on a $100,00 bond and currently resides in Quincy, Massachusetts where he awaits his sentencing.
The hearing is scheduled for Jan. 5 and the honest service wire fraud he admitted to carries a maximum imprisonment term of 20 years, according to the news release.

HOUSTON – If Adolis Garcia had simply winced, tossed his bat aside and taken his base, Bryan Abreu might still be eligible to pitch in the American League Championship Series.
Instead, Garcia, the Texas Rangers slugger, got in the face of Houston Astros catcher Martin Maldonado, inciting a benches-clearing incident that resulted in Abreu’s ejection from Game 5 of the ALCS.
Saturday, Abreu learned he’d be suspended for the remainder of the series.
Major League Baseball suspended Abreu for two games, agreeing with the umpiring crew that Abreu threw intentionally at Garcia and taking “into account the dangerous nature of the pitch and its potential impact on player safety.”
Abreu can appeal the suspension and is expected to do so. If the suspension is upheld, Abreu would miss Sunday’s Game 6 and a potential Game 7 – or be out for Game 1 of the World Series. The Astros lead the ALCS 3-2 and can clinch the AL pennant at Minute Maid Park on Sunday.
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
Inactive players Lance McCullers and Matt Bush have also been barred from the dugout during games because they left the bench during the incident.
Abreu’s loss is significant for the Astros. He is perhaps their most dominant reliever and typically works the seventh or eighth inning setting up closer Ryan Pressly. Abreu struck out 100 batters in 72 innings and recorded a 1.75 ERA. 
Friday’s Game 5 incident occurred after Garcia hit a go-ahead three-run homer off starter Justin Verlander and punctuated it with a bat spike and a deliberate walk down the first base line. Garcia, Maldonado and Rangers second baseman Marcus Semien were also involved in a fracas during a July game.
But the Astros were adamant that Abreu would not intentionally hit Garcia in a playoff game, especially as they trailed 4-2 in the eighth inning of a pivotal game. An inning later, Jose Altuve hit a three-run homer to give the Astros a 5-4 victory.
“I’m the kind of guy, I don’t care about celebrations. That was a big, big moment for him. He got the chance to celebrate, do whatever he wants,” Abreu said after Game 5. "I know that was a really hot moment. OK, I get it. But obviously, you’ve got to give me a warning or something. We’re just trying to compete.
“I didn’t do anything wrong. It meant a lot to me.”
And Garcia obviously inflamed the situation, earning an ejection himself after he jawed at Maldonado and forced home plate umpire Marvin Hudson to wedge himself between them. 
Astros manager Dusty Baker, who was also ejected from Game 5 after angrily reacting to Abreu’s dismissal, says he expects tensions may remain high in Sunday’s Game 6. How that manifests, he does not know.
“The players don't want to get into fights and skirmishes. And most of these guys know each other,” Baker said Saturday at Minute Maid Park. “Especially Latin guys are closer than anybody. But when emotions get high – have you ever gotten in an argument with your mom or your dad or your brothers?
“It happens. And you don't script it. It's a spontaneous, combustible reaction that gets out of control.”
This is the second time this year that Neena Nizar’s wheelchair was damaged on a flight, and she said it’s much worse now.
“My wheelchair is totaled. I’ve had it break before but not like this,” she told USA TODAY.
Nizar was flying home to Nebraska from Vancouver via Denver on United Airlines on Oct. 13, and she said she watched her wheelchair fall off the baggage belt after landing in Omaha.
“There was nobody holding it, and there was nobody there to receive it so it fell right off,” she said. “That’s crazy, it’s like, are you kidding me?” 
In May, the chair’s armrests were damaged after a flight on Southwest Airlines, but the device was still usable. Now, Nizar said, her wheelchair won’t even turn on.
Nizar realized the extent of the damage on the jet bridge and ultimately spent hours in the Omaha airport after her flight trying to see what recourse was available before eventually being pushed in her non-functioning wheelchair to the airport entrance and carried and driven home by her husband.
“I just started crying, I was so upset, I said, ‘how could you do this?’ ” she said. “I was numb, I was just in shock.”
United Airlines acknowledged the incident in a statement to USA TODAY.
“We’ve been working with Ms. Nizar to get her a high-end loaner chair and her preferred vendor is currently assessing her wheelchair. We’ve apologized to Ms. Nizar and will cover the cost of repairs or a replacement, depending on the final assessment,” the statement said.
But Nizar said simply replacing her chair isn’t nearly sufficient compensation.
“I can’t walk my dog. I can’t go to the grocery. It was my son’s birthday the other day and I needed to go to the store multiple times and I couldn’t … I teach and I need to be able to go out and teach as well and I can’t do that,” she said. “I have to rearrange everything and they're not going to compensate for any of this.”
For now, Nizar said, she’s stuck at home until she gets her chair replaced or a fully-functional loaner.
“I asked them how am I going to get to work, how am I going to continue to be able to put food on the table for my family if I can’t get around?” she said. “The response from one of the customer service people was ‘have someone drive you’ and it’s like, ‘what? This isn’t my car that broke down, this is my wheelchair, this is like my legs.’ They just don’t understand.” 
Nizar said it could take up to a year for her chair to be fully replaced, because the device needs to be custom fit to her body. She said the whole situation makes her feel unwanted by the travel industry.
“I just feel even more angry that we are isolating this whole section of society who otherwise would be productive and moving around and working … It’s almost like a fear mechanism you’ve created that prevents people from doing what they need to do,” she said. “It’s not an option for me to stop traveling and I don’t want to stop traveling because it’s my right to travel.”
According to the Department of Transportation, airlines "mishandle" on average about 1.5% of the mobility equipment they transport. In 2022, that translated to 11,389 incidents reported by U.S. airlines, up from 7,239 in 2021.
This year, USA TODAY wants to highlight what those figures mean for travelers with disabilities. We're looking to track these incidents throughout 2023 with the goal of bringing light to an all-too-common problem.

Editor's note: Part one of a five-part USA TODAY series revealing why America hasn't solved its long struggle with Type 2 diabetes.
For chef Robin Ray, newly married with young stepchildren, the turning point came when a stabbing chest pain sent her rushing to the emergency room. 
For Brian Castrucci, the gravity hit when the ER doc who had treated him for a near-heart attack a few weeks earlier gave him a big bear hug. “I didn’t think you’d make it,” the doctor said.
The crisis unspooled more slowly for James Haynes but started in 2019 when he stepped on a rusty nail and didn’t notice. 
The moments were turning points for all three to get serious about addressing their diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can’t properly regulate blood sugar, has become so common it’s almost considered inconsequential. More than 1 in 10 Americans have the disease (though many don't know) and another nearly 4 in 10 are at risk for it. In total, half of all adults and a quarter of teenagers have diabetes or pre-diabetes.
Its financial costs are astronomical. The country spends more than $300 billion a year to address diabetes, accounting for $1 out of every $4 spent on health care. 
And its personal tolls are even worse: heart attacks, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, double the risk of premature death. It also causes what’s known as “diabetes distress,” the daily burdens and emotional toll of living with and managing a chronic ailment that can lead to regular dips in energy, foggy thinking and depression, and a sense of isolation.
The most frustrating aspect of Type 2 diabetes, experts say, is that it has long been largely preventable and controllable. 
“We have made tremendous gains in understanding diabetes,” said Dr. Donald Berwick, a pediatrician and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “The best diabetes care can make a very big difference. You can’t say we don’t know what to do.”
And yet, diagnosed rates of Type 2 diabetes have soared over the past 25 years, and especially over the past dozen – particularly among working-age adults like Ray, Castrucci and Haynes. 
Roughly 40% of people who died early in the coronavirus pandemic had Type 2 diabetes, a rate four times higher than people without the disease. Even when elevated blood sugar levels are below the threshold for type 2 diabetes, the risk for heart disease jumps 30% to 50% compared with people with normal blood sugar levels. (Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 5% to 10% of diabetes, is caused by the immune system and is unrelated to diet or lifestyle.)
America’s failure to address Type 2 diabetes highlights larger problems with our food and medical systems, Berwick and other experts said.
A soda costs less than a bottle of water, a double cheeseburger and fries less than a carton of blueberries. Patients wait months for medical appointments only to see the back of a white coat for the short time they’re allotted. Treating disease costs society far more than preventing it but typically provides more profit for insurance companies, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry.
The USA TODAY Health team spoke with scores of health care providers, researchers, community leaders and patients for this five-part series to understand why Type 2 diabetes continues to worsen in America despite known solutions.
The answer isn't simple. It involves systemic problems facing everyone in society, not just those with diabetes: a food system designed to sell products; a medical system in which cutting off a leg is less expensive than saving it; the high cost of healthy living and the fact that breaking habits takes a lot more than just personal willpower.
This first story looks at what it takes for people to cope with or overcome the disease.
Then, we explore one community in a David vs. Goliath battle against a food system that fails to prioritize people's health.

The system is fixable, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.
But it will take "sensible action" from across many sectors, including health care, science, nutrition, business, public health and politics to change the financial and other incentives that drive so many Americans toward sickness instead of health.
"If we do it all, we could fix a lot of this in 10 years," said Mozaffarian, who serves on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. "If we do it incrementally or don't do it at all, we're all going to be toast in 50 years from diet-related illnesses and a depleted environment."
There’s no question personal responsibility plays a role in fighting diabetes. 
Haynes, Ray and Castrucci radically changed their lifestyles and sought help after their come-to-Jesus experiences. They’ve reduced their dependence on daily medication and hope to have saved themselves the horrors of more amputations, blindness and dialysis. They’ve extended their lives and improved the quality of that time.
But like many medical problems, the challenges of diabetes go well beyond individual responsibility and blame. 
“There are structural issues that we have to start paying attention to and addressing,” said Dr. Shivani Agarwal, an endocrinologist who specializes in research and treating young adults with diabetes at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Agarwal recently led a series of studies in the journal The Lancet that looked at diabetes rates around the world. 
Poverty, the studies showed, was a major driver of diabetes, along with racism and unequal access to healthy food and high-quality medical care.
Personal stories illustrate how these structural issues play out in the lives of so many Americans.
Ray, 45, director of culinary operations at HOSCO/North Sarah Food Hub in St. Louis, got weight-loss surgery and then put her culinary expertise to good use.  
Castrucci, 49, who runs a public health nonprofit outside Washington, D.C., used his advantages provided by his work, salary and insurance to “buy” himself better health.
 “I’m healthy because of privilege – not diet, not exercise, not determination,” he said.
Haynes, 58, a former truck driver and maintenance technician in Gulfport, Mississippi, has fewer material assets, but his attitude and the advantages he does have explain why he's still around, despite all he has been through.
“It’s going to be all right after a while, as long as I keep this spirit,” he said.
Ray’s love for food began when she was 8 years old, watching Julia Child on TV. During family gatherings, she would run around taking everyone’s dinner order. Then she’d scurry back to the kitchen with a notepad full of scribbles. 
Throughout her life, she made fried chicken, pork chops, baked mac and cheese, collard greens, and even a whole roasted chicken filled with wild rice and two sticks of butter – everything that made her soul sing. 
In her world, food was home. Food was family. Food was love. 
But that was some pretty tough love. 
In 2002, Ray was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Her father, grandmother, aunts and uncles all had diabetes. She knew what it meant.
“For you to tell me I can’t have ice blue raspberry Kool-Aid was like you shut down my world,” Ray said. “I didn’t want to accept it. So, I ate, because you eat through your emotions.” 
She didn't dwell on the diagnosis and continued with life. Her culinary career took her to Italy, where she learned and fell even more in love with food. She returned to St. Louis, got married and became a mom to her husband’s two children ‒ “beautiful bonus babies,” as she described them. Through the years, she continued to express love through cooking and eating. 
In 2015, a stabbing chest pain sent her to the emergency room. Doctors assured Ray she hadn’t had a heart attack, but they warned that her life was on the line. At 5-foot-2, she weighed 334 pounds and had an A1C, a measure of average blood sugar of 11%, well above the 6.5% cutoff to be considered diabetic. Her diabetes – and her diet – were out of control. 
“That scared me. … It was gut-wrenching and terrifying,” she said. “I’m fighting against something that’s fighting me back and I did not know how to win.” 
She and her primary care doctor decided she would pursue weight loss surgery. 
But she also decided to use her culinary prowess to transform her diet. She reconfigured favorite foods, substituting healthier ingredients: Collard greens cooked in smoked fats or ham hocks turned into a kale, turnip and rutabaga recipe flavored with natural chicken broth fat, oils and seasonings. 
She fostered her feelings into new recipes and brought them to North Sarah Food Hub, which partnered with Barnes-Jewish Hospital to make packaged, pre-made meals for St. Louis residents with diabetes and limited access to fresh food.
“I had to restructure the food that I put in my mouth. I had to think about what I was eating and how I was eating and how it was going to be good for my body,” she said. “I became excited about food again, and food became a joy.” 
It isn’t always easy, of course. Ray admits to an occasional cookie craving. But now she takes the time to think about how her body processes that cookie and whether it’s worthwhile. 
She hopes her cooking can help other people make the same transformation she did. Her staff at North Sarah helps her create new recipes for others. She wants to provide nourishment that allows people to avoid illness and medicine. 
“Nobody wants to take 55 pills, nobody wants to feel like a patient, but how do you fix that? It’s by our food,” she said. “That should be what we’re teaching our community and our culture and our children. … It’s not always about the macaroni noodle with a smile, it’s about what’s good for your body.” 
Castrucci is a third-generation diabetes patient. The lifetime risk of developing Type 2 diabetes if a parent has it is 40%. If both parents have it, the risk jumps to 70%.
He knew he was at risk, but he pushed his luck, he said, by eating poorly during the pandemic and falling out of his exercise routine. With the luxury of working from home, walking to the kitchen and bathroom was often the extent of his daily activity.
On Feb. 14, 2022 – Valentine’s Day – he went to an urgent care clinic, concerned his breathing trouble meant he had bronchitis. His blood pressure measured 210 over 110, well above normal levels that top out at 120 over 80. A chest X-ray showed fluid filling his lungs, leading to congestive heart failure. 
The clinic sent him straight to a local emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a blockage of the left descending artery – a clogged artery made worse by diabetes. If he had waited any longer, he would have had a massive heart attack, his doctor later told him.
After his release from the hospital, he went to the drugstore to fill his new prescriptions. The pharmacist told him she couldn’t fill one because it would cost $1,000. He’d have to wait until his insurance approved it. “Please fill it,” he said. She stressed the cost. “Fill it,” he pleaded, putting the charge on his credit card.
Medication helped him lose 70 pounds in three months. When his local drugstore ran out of the weight-loss drug, he easily drove to another pharmacy and then another to find what he needed. 
His 100 hours of high-quality cardiac rehabilitation were fully covered by insurance.  
"For my midlife crisis, I got healthy," Castrucci said.
He could devote all his energy to getting well because he didn’t have to focus on how to afford his care. “(I) paid almost nothing for the whole episode,” he said, “and never worried about it because I have really good insurance.” 
Even so, Castrucci pays out-of-pocket for a cardiologist and an endocrinologist because the best ones near him don’t accept insurance.
Every time he goes to Walgreens to refill his medications, Castrucci said, he sees someone turned away because they can’t afford their prescriptions. When they finally show up in the emergency room, “because they will,” they will cost the system far more, he said.
“Health outcomes are dictated by economics. It’s a whole side of privilege that we don’t always talk about.”
On the day Haynes stepped on a rusty nail in 2019, he walked all day as the nail pierced the sole of his sneaker and then his foot. By the time he took off his shoe that night, his foot was infected. He landed in the hospital for two months as doctors and nurses tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to get the infection and Haynes’ blood sugar under control.
By the time he was released, he knew enough about Type 2 diabetes to realize his daily blood sugar levels – typically in the mid-400s – were four times above what he had been told to shoot for.
But nothing he did or ate seemed to make a difference. He had long since traded ribs for salads, beer for water. 
His wife, Angela, barely noticed when James started wearing multiple pairs of socks, pouring powder on his feet and buying bigger shoes. His feet tingled a lot, he said, but he was coping with it. 
James ended up in the emergency room again, dehydrated and in need of antibiotics. The doctor amputated the baby toe on his right foot, leaving a large open wound. 
"We're going to leave this open because we'll probably have to take more,” Angela remembered the doctor saying. “I didn't like that we're not going to try to save anything, we're just going to start cutting.”
James was fading.
His arm muscles shriveled and he lost his Popeye physique. Antibiotics left him looking sickly, his voice so weak Angela could barely hear him. “I felt like I was watching my husband slowly dying,” she said.
Finally, taking her doctor sister’s advice, Angela emailed Dr. Foluso Fakorede’s office to ask for an appointment. She thought it would take months to get James in to see the heart disease specialist, but the office called and asked if they could come the next day. 
The Hayneses would end up going back to see Fakorede many times − sometimes twice in one week, driving more than five hours each way from Gulfport north to Cleveland, Mississippi.
“We started looking forward to these visits because there was always hope,” Angela Haynes said, though she felt guilty they were taking up so much of the important doctor’s time. 
Fakorede, who is on a personal mission to save people with diabetes from amputations, noticed what other doctors had missed. Haynes had blockages in blood vessels on both legs. 
Once he got the blood flowing again, Haynes began to feel better. His flesh returned to its normal color. The wound started healing at last. Walking became easier.
Then disaster struck again. 
On July 2, 2022, Haynes caught COVID-19. "Everything went downhill after that," he said.
During his 13-day illness, the bacteria in his foot raged out of control. He ended up back in the hospital and unable to withstand the long drive to Fakorede’s office.
Every week, a surgeon would come to the door of his hospital room and before even stepping all the way in ask Haynes whether he had decided to get his leg amputated. 
"This is my leg. I was born with this. And you're walking in like you're cutting a piece of cake," Haynes said.
He was worried about how he’d get around, how he’d be able to work to support his family if he had only one leg. No one took the time to explain why they thought the leg needed to come off or how he’d cope without it, Haynes said. 
In late November, he was finally sent home in a wheelchair. But just three weeks later, as he was getting out of the car after wound care, his right leg gave out and he fell to the ground. Back at the hospital, Haynes was told his foot was broken, essentially beyond repair. He agreed to a below-the-knee amputation.
Released right before Christmas, he spent the next three weeks in bed wondering how he’d manage the rest of his life.
Finally, it looked as if his luck might be turning around.
With the leg gone, his diabetes improved. His blood sugar dropped into the 120s or one-teens. His blurry vision cleared up.
During his long hospital stay, he befriended nurses and learned about a program for people who needed prostheses. The man who ran it called early in the year and said he had received a donated leg. If it fit Haynes, he could have it while waiting for insurance to pay for a personalized one. Miraculously, it did. 
Haynes spent the next six months teaching himself to walk again. The donor leg was heavy and uncomfortable. He wasn't mobile enough to hold down a job.
One late spring night, picking up dinner at a nearby restaurant, he headed to the bathroom for a pit stop. A sink had been leaking all day and Haynes slipped in the puddle, falling backward.
He's still recovering from the resulting wrist surgery.
He and Angela are living – barely – off her part-time salary as a secretary and a church organist.
Haynes has tried "at least three or four times" to receive government assistance, but they keep losing his paperwork, or not believing he's disabled, though he once checked himself out of the hospital and arrived at an appointment in his wheelchair to prove he didn't have a leg.
Still, he clings to his faith and the positive attitude he has long used to cheer up himself and others. These are his secret weapons against diabetes and everything else life throws his way.
"I try to put a smile on other people's faces," he said. "It keeps my day going."

Since the Israeli military ordered civilians to flee Gaza as it pursues Hamas militants, more than 1 million Palestinians have left their homes in the face of mounting airstrikes.
Vehicles carrying relief supplies stood motionless at Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip this week while locals and aid organizations begged for food, water and fuel for generators. They said the tiny territory sealed off by Israel after last week’s rampage by Hamas was near total collapse.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who had been forced from their homes were searching for bread. Hospitals in Gaza were on the brink of power outages, endangering the lives of thousands of patients. As an Israeli ground invasion seemed a certainty, Hamas militants continued their relentless rocket fire, and tensions grew along the Israel-Lebanon border to the north.
The Gaza power plant and power cables from Israel, which were Gaza's two primary suppliers of electricity, are no longer operational. At the beginning of the siege, Israel cut off its supply of electricity to the city, and the power plant ceased operations almost a week ago because of a shortage of fuel.

On Oct. 11, the Gaza Power Plant in Deir al-Balah, immediately south of the evacuation area, closed for lack of fuel. And with the suspension of Israeli supplies, Gaza is now without energy. 
Hospitals and other large facilities have backup generators, but when the fuel runs out, Israel's blockade will prevent new supplies from coming in.
Hospitals in Gaza "risk turning into morgues" without electricity, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The death toll on both sides has surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five wars involving the narrow, densely populated strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.

The Israeli military ramped up its reach Sunday, striking targets in Syria, the West Bank and Gaza amid growing concerns the war will spread more widely across the Middle East.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian warned Israel and the U.S on Sunday that "if they do not immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza, anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control."
The intensified military actions came as a convoy of humanitarian aid trucks made its way into Gaza from Egypt for a second day. But the U.N. warned the aid is about 4% of the daily average of imports into previous conflicts and a fraction of what is needed.
Israel has been pounding Gaza relentlessly since Hamas' stunning, brutal attack Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,000 Israelis and saw the seizure of more than 200 hostages.
"Bombardments continue almost unabated as hostilities enter the 15th day in Gaza," the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in its latest situation report.
First humanitarian aid reaches Gaza:Convoy arrives after 2 weeks of Israel-Hamas war
Developments:
∎ The Rafah crossing from Egypt, which opened Saturday with the passage of 20 aid trucks, saw 17 more trucks carrying food, water and medical supplies enter Gaza on Sunday. The U.N. humanitarian affairs agency says it is "imperative" to increase the number to at least 100 trucks per day.
∎ Hezbollah’s deputy leader in Lebanon, Sheikh Naim Kassem, warned that Israel would pay a high price going forward if it commences a much-anticipated ground offensive in Gaza.
Syria said it was forced to shut down international airports in Damascus and Aleppo because of the Israeli strike. The Syrian Transport Ministry said landing strips at both airports were damaged by missiles and one civilian worker was killed and another wounded at Damascus International Airport. Israel has carried out several strikes in Syria since the war began, citing the need to prevent Hezbollah and other militant groups from bringing in arms from Iran, which also supports Hamas.
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed at least five people there early Sunday, according to the local Health Ministry. Two were killed in an airstrike on a mosque in the town of Jenin, which the Israeli military said belonged to Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who had carried out several attacks and were planning another one.
Palestinian militants have fired over 7,000 rockets into Israel since the war began, the Israel Defense Force says, and tens of thousands of Israeli's have been forced to flee their homes. Hamas says it targeted Tel Aviv early Sunday.
The Israeli death toll has surpassed 1,400, most of the civilians killed in the first hours of Hamas' bloody attack on border villages. At least 212 people were taken hostage; two Americans were released Friday in what Hamas described as a humanitarian gesture. The Gaza Health Ministry put the Palestinian death toll at 4,385; almost two-thirds of the fatalities are children and women. More than 1,000 people have been reported missing and are feared trapped or dead under the rubble.
Israel repeated its calls Sunday for Palestinians to leave northern Gaza. Israeli authorities say an estimated 700,000 have already fled, but hundreds of thousands remain. Fleeing to southern Gaza has provided little relief as Israeli airstrikes there have also battered cities and infrastructure. Gaza's Housing Ministry says more than 160,000 homes and apartments − more than 40% of all dwellings − in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the war began two weeks ago.
The result is that about 1.4 million of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been "internally displaced," and 566,000 of them are staying in U.N. emergency shelters, the U.N. says.
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, and several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for the establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material, and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.

The blood libel isn’t new – but it is terrifying to see it spread across the world in the wake of the Hamas massacre, its reach expanded and its impact intensified by shoddy news coverage of this crisis.
Palestinian terror groups’ false accusation that Israeli forces destroyed a hospital in Gaza was instantly covered as fact by journalists. As the unconfirmed allegation was highlighted in headlines, news feeds and push notifications, the reaction was immediate, threatening Jewish communities around the world.
This happened even as the allegation was quickly rebutted by the Israeli government. And U.S. sources have said that the missile likely was fired from within Gaza by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a local terror organization that essentially serves as a junior version of Hamas.
As the sun rose, it became clear that, while the misfired missile had claimed casualties, the hospital had not been flattened. Indeed, independent experts assessed that it had been set ablaze by an explosion on the ground.
Based on overhead imagery, communications intercept and open-source data, governmental and nongovernmental sources confirmed that the damage likely had been caused by a rocket fired by terrorists inside Gaza. But it was far, far too late.
Journalists' knee-jerk assumption that Israel bombed a hospital already had attained escape velocity, traveling around the world and inflaming hatred along the way.
It was expected for Arab media to report the lie. Outlets like Al Jazeera has dispensed with any pretense of objectivity.
But it was even more damning to see Western media, including the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, jump on the Hamas-driven charge and spread it without the normal processes that ensure the integrity of their reporting.
“Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinians Say,” blared a headline in The Times (later changed to “Israelis and Palestinians Blame Each Other for Blast at Gaza Hospital That Killed Hundreds.”)
In addition, reputable newspapers such as The Washington Post and news organizations such as The Associated Press and Reuters amplified the accusatory claims.
The level of incompetence was staggering – and dangerous.
In the 24 hours after the incident, the misinformation fueled a wave of antisemitic hate. There are almost too many examples to count. A synagogue in Germany was firebombed. Anti-Israel protesters descended on the U.S. Capitol and flooded Amman, Jordan; Beirut, Lebanon; and other capitals. This is just the beginning. 
Some, but not all, news outlets have backtracked on the claim and corrected the record. Fortunately, no one has been killed as a direct result of this irresponsible coverage. But the odds seem likely that people might be killed if this kind of misreporting reoccurs.

How does this happen?
When Hamas makes a claim, media outlets must ask hard questions. As a terrorist organization that forbids free speech and outlaws open expression, it has a track record of spreading lies and propaganda. Its leaders actively engage in information warfare, using all the means at their disposal.
For example, rather than cite the Ministry of Health in Gaza as a source, it would be more accurate to reference it as the Hamas Health Ministry, because it is an arm of the terrorist government. Outlets also should stop referring to Hamas operatives as “fighters” or “militants.” They are unrepentant terrorists whose malevolence is confirmed by more than 1,400 body bags in Israel, let alone the over 200 hostages, ranging from infants to the elderly, held against their will in the Gaza Strip.
Hamas invaded my brother's home.Now, my family is held hostage in Gaza.
But the problem is not just the official Hamas line. Western news agencies cannot operate bureaus in Gaza as they do in Israel and other democracies around the world. Reporters are not allowed to roam around and pursue stories at will. Instead, Hamas restricts who can report on the situation – and who cannot.
It is time for journalists to acknowledge their accountability in this crisis. Irresponsible reporting can enable the spread of a modern-day blood libel. The blood libel is an ancient charge, a pernicious myth that Jewish people intentionally kill non-Jews for any number of reasons.
An ancient form of fake news, the blood libel fueled antisemitic pogroms in Europe and was later imported to the Middle East.
Today, we see the blood libel in full effect when the world recklessly blames Israel for any number of crimes. It proliferates when, in this delicate moment, major media outlets fail to apply the normal checks and balances used to minimize misinformation. It has always been dangerous, but it is even more explosive in the Information Age because Jews around the world will be the victims.
As the Hamas war rages and tensions rise, media services around the world must take responsibility and prevent false information from spreading and fanning the flames of hate.

As we can see in Ukraine and now the Middle East, wars of aggression, acts of genocide, tyranny and terrorist atrocities do not happen in isolation.
From the seeds of a strong-arm regime in Germany, sprouted with virulent antisemitism, came the continentwide extermination of Jews. The shadows of the Holocaust loom large, with contemporary Western society constructed upon the principle of "never again." Yet, disturbingly, echoes of the past resurface as Jewish populations face vile antisemitism in Europe and America, and calls for "peace" mask veiled justifications for Hamas' heinous acts, which, at their core, revel in cruelty and degradation.
The Soviet Union's oppressive legacy endures. Bosnian genocide, Yugoslav wars, poverty, oligarchism, Russian invasions of Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine – all of these didn’t happen out of nowhere. Countless individuals, particularly in Eastern Europe and notably Ukraine, grapple with fractured family histories and tales of ancestors deported, killed or incarcerated. Such generational trauma requires immense time and understanding to be fully addressed and healed. 
The Syrian war, with its novel brand of horror, did not emerge spontaneously. The alliance between Hezbollah, a notorious Lebanese terrorist entity, and Russia, which at that point was a widely accepted partner of the free world, started in 2015 in Syria and has not stopped.
Now, the repercussions of every past atrocity reverberate globally. The same culprits, repeatedly emboldened, perpetrate murder, torture and degradation as the world seeks reassurance and the illusion of peace.
Hamas, responsible for the deaths of entire Israeli families, finds camaraderie in Moscow. Syria's Assad regime deploys chemical warfare on its populace, bolstered by Hezbollah and Russia. Hezbollah launches assaults on Israel, underpinned by its intricate ties with Iran, Syria and Russia.
Russia's savage invasion of Ukraine persists, with Iranians providing applause and weaponry. African nations are inundated with propaganda, giving a stage to ruthless Russian mercenaries – while China quietly acquires the continent piece by piece. And China's menacing stance toward Taiwan, combined with its support for Russia's aggression toward Ukraine, signals a broader threat to the free world.
This vicious cycle offers no genuine peace. 
Ukraine working to document war crimes:Ukrainians need America's help to hold Russian war criminals accountable for atrocities
Regrettably, the free world isn't merely an idle observer. Much of the technology utilized by Russia and terrorist factions originates in the West.
Billions in humanitarian aid have flowed into Gaza, only to line the pockets of Hamas leaders living lavishly in Qatar or to finance militants who funnel these funds into weapon smuggling. European aid items, including water pipes, have been repurposed by Hamas to fashion missiles aimed at Israel. 
Microelectronics are incorporated into missiles that wreak havoc upon civilians in Ukraine and anywhere else terrorists enact their terror. Despite bans, embargoes and sanctions on international companies, Russia continues to utilize Western tools to manufacture advanced weaponry – the very same machines that still benefit from maintenance by their manufacturers, such as German-Japanese DMG Mori or American Haas Automation.
Why do these companies persist in servicing equipment instrumental in aiding a nation led by an accused war criminal to produce arms? Greed appears to be the likeliest culprit. Such convenient "ignorance" of the end-users (Russian arms manufacturers) does not make an excuse for silent war crimes enablers.
To those who argue that Europe or the United States should abstain from intervening in distant conflicts, a sobering reality check is due: Their involvement is already apparent, just not in a way most of the people imagine. This is evidenced by the surging exports to nations that orbit Russia – for instance, German exports to Kyrgyzstan soared by 949% last year, according to a Reuters analysis, with a significant proportion finding its way to Russia.
Moreover, the inability to curtail purchases of Russian resources, such as the U.S. acquisition of uranium from Rosatom, effectively bankrolls the adversary's military operations.
Concurrently, China capitalizes on its position as the manufacturing hub for Western tech, striving to replicate and pilfer Western innovations. 
Stop following China.United Nations is ruled by 'we the peoples,' not authoritarian regimes.
The sobering truth is that countries such as China, Iran, Belarus and Russia are already waging a covert war against the free world, and it's high time the latter acknowledged this reality and stopped fighting against itself.
True global tranquility remains elusive until the world recognizes that witnessing brutality is never a standalone event. The civilizational war has started, and it’s time for all to choose their allegiance.

Take it from Jim Schwartz. It’s way too early to consider the Cleveland Browns' defense as one of the best in NFL history.
That’s no kind of knock on the amazing pace the NFL’s stingiest defense has established through five games this season. The Browns – leading the league for fewest yards, passing yards, points, first downs and third-down conversions allowed – have some of the best numbers ever produced at this point in a campaign. If this holds up, the comparisons to great defenses of yesteryear will be validated.
Yet it’s still early. 
“Well, they don’t give out any trophies for five weeks,” Schwartz, Cleveland’s defensive coordinator, said during a news conference this week. “I think we all know that. It’s a long season, and we’re going to have to survive a lot of highs and lows throughout the season.
“We have some experienced players. We have some experienced coaches that have been there, that know that. And I think that’s one of the things that keeps us grounded. So let me know when the five-week stats are part of the tiebreaker. When they are, we’ll really concentrate on that.”
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
Schwartz – whose perspective includes landing his only NFL head-coaching shot with the task of taking over a Detroit Lions squad that finished 0-16 the season before – has long been established as one of the league’s premier defensive strategists.
MORE:Five NFL players who need change of scenery as trade deadline approaches
That’s being proven again already during his first year with the Browns, as he has employed a wide-nine front and other wrinkles and surprises (see Myles Garrett’s feigned “crossover dribble” while lined up as a stand-up middle linebacker against the Bengals) to help a talented unit reach new heights.
Getting a glimpse of Schwartz fielding questions as he prepared for Sunday’s game at Indianapolis, though, showed that in addition to pushing the right buttons when it involves the X’s and O’s, he also set the proper tone against the landscape of the what-have-you-done-lately NFL.
Someone asked Schwartz to assess how defensive end Ogbo Okoronkwo is faring. The response was classic, given that for all of the defensive superlatives, the Browns (3-2) are in third place in the A-North.
“He’s playing 3-2, right?” Schwartz said. “I mean, we’re all playing 3-2. Our defensive stats are 3-2, everything else, and he’s doing his job within – I don’t want to downplay it. I just don’t want to get into the whole rate of everybody’s play. It’s not about individuals. We talked about that last week. It’s about the group. It’s about all 11.”
He praised Okoronkwo’s effort and physicality, then finished by stating, “We’ll leave PFF (Pro Football Focus) to grading the players and where they rank in the league and all those things.”
In any event, the “all 11” and additional role players on Schwartz’s unit can certainly take a bow for how they handled one of the hottest offenses in the league in the 19-17 upset of the previously unbeaten San Francisco 49ers last Sunday. The 49ers, who scored at least 30 points in their first five games, were limited to 215 total yards.
For the season, Cleveland has allowed just 1,002 yards – third-fewest in the NFL through five games since 1970, after the 1971 Colts (836) and 1970 Vikings (945). This is connected to the league’s best rate on third downs, with just 15 conversions on 65 attempts (23.1%).
So many of the numbers are staggering. The Browns have allowed just 52 first downs, even more impressive when considering the team with the next-fewest, Tampa Bay, has allowed 94 first downs.
While the sack total (15) is average and the takeaways (four) way on the low end, that’s covered by the minimal yards (220.4 per game) and points allowed (77).
So maybe it’s a bit early to rank the Browns' defense among the best ever. But even Schwartz doesn’t mind his talented unit rolling with a fair amount of swagger.
“That would look foolish if we’re out there giving up 42 points,” Schwartz said. “If we’re last in the league on third-down percentage and things like that, then it just becomes clownish behavior. But I think a lot’s being said with if you’re going to have some personality and some swagger, then you better back it up on the field. And I like our guys’ ability to do that.”
The scrutiny on new quarterback Derek Carr was intense enough when considering the disastrous results the New Orleans Saints have produced when getting near the goal line this season.
Now the heat has gone up a few notches – by Carr’s own actions during the 31-24 loss against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday.
Carr was shown blowing a gasket after an ugly incompletion – receiver Chris Olave stopped while apparently running a third-down go route – during the nationally televised game on Amazon. It was not a good look, and not the only example of questionable body language to express frustration.
“I’ve been showing my emotion a little bit too much on my sleeve,” Carr told reporters during his postgame news conference. “You know, like, I kind of got to kind of chill out, and that’s me holding myself accountable. Because that’s not going to help anything.
“I can do a better job as a leader to calm everybody down.”
He can also help the Saints reverse their red-zone patterns. New Orleans entered Week 7 ranked 28th in the NFL for TD rate after reaching the red zone (36.8%, seven TDs on 19 possessions), then scored just two TDs on five red-zone trips against the Jaguars.
Carr, though, couldn’t be blamed for the result of a perfect pass that slipped through the fingers of tight end Foster Moreau in the end zone in the final seconds. And what he said afterward, when it was mentioned that teammates rallied around a distraught Moreau, suggests that he gets it when considering how his response can make a difference.
“I’ve been in that moment, when you miss a throw or you throw a bad pick or something like that, you feel like everybody hates you,” Carr said. “Our job as teammates is no matter what the situation, good or bad, is that you put your arm around him and keep ‘em going.”
In other words, pointing fingers is not the ticket.
The trade that brought Mecole Hardman back to Kansas City from the New York Jets could be huge for a Chiefs offense that has struggled to get consistent production from its wide receivers. Hardman, a second-round pick by the Chiefs in 2019, left in March on a one-year, $4 million free-agent deal. But he was lost in the wash, so to speak, with a Jets offense trying to recover from Aaron Rodgers’ torn Achilles tendon. In five games with the Jets, Hardman caught one pass for six yards. Now he’s back, essentially for the price of a sixth-round pick.
Hardman certainly won’t be lost in reuniting with Patrick Mahomes for at least two reasons: 1) opportunity and need. 2) familiarity.
Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy likened the expectation of Hardman flowing in KC’s offense to “riding a bike.”
“It’s not always just super simple,” Nagy said during a Thursday news conference, “but it is certainly easier for somebody like him that’s been here to come back in and go.”
Especially with Kansas City wideouts Marques Valdes-Scantling, Kadarius Toney and Skyy Moore combining for 35 catches and two TDs, behind second-round rookie Rashee Rice’s 21 receptions and two TDs.
The Chiefs found multiple ways of using Hardman’s top-end speed in recent years, including as a weapon in running jet sweeps and as a returner. His 2022 season, though, was cut short after eight games due to a pelvic/abdominal injury that had him hospitalized for 10 days.
“Scary as hell,” is how Hardman described his injury last year.
If he regains his groove in the Chiefs' offense, Hardman could reflect a different type of fear factor for opposing defenses.
For all the woes that have struck the New York Giants' offensive line – four linemen this week were added to the roster from various practice squads, while the G-men scramble to settle on a left tackle with Joshua Ezeudu placed on IR due to a toe injury – it’s notable the unit still hasn’t allowed the most sacks in the NFL. That dubious distinction belongs to Washington, which heads into the matchup against the Giants on Sunday having allowed 34 sacks. New York has yielded 33 sacks. Considering that the league average is 15 ½ sacks allowed, it’s reasonable to project a sackfest for MetLife Stadium this weekend.
As of Friday, Giants coach Brian Daboll wasn’t ready to declare a starting left tackle, with the candidates including Justin Pugh, Josh Myles and Tyre Phillips. Pugh re-joined the team two weeks ago, while Myles and Phillips were signed this week off practice squads for Atlanta and Philadelphia, respectively, with New York losing seven of its original nine offensive linemen this season to injuries.
“Yeah, we have four new players on the offensive line that have been here for some less than a week, some less than two weeks, and we’re working tirelessly with them in terms of meetings, getting them up to speed on calls, practicing them at different spots,” Daboll told reporters. “You have to have plans, too. If one guy gets hurt, then here’s the next guy, they’re not playing that spot. There’s been a lot of shuffling. We’re trying our best to have as best continuity as we can, but those are the circumstances we are faced with.”
The Eagles signing of veteran wide receiver Julio Jones offers the promise of a playmaker with seven Pro Bowl selections on his resume … and caution. Jones, 34, is with his fourth team in as many seasons, and has missed seven games in each of the past three seasons with Tampa Bay, Tennessee and Atlanta, due to assorted injuries.
Philadelphia coach Nick Sirianni, whose offense could use a jolt as receiver DeVonta Smith nurses a hamstring injury, liked what he saw from Jones on the practice field this week. But he must weigh that against the notion of expecting too much, too soon.
“You’re going to be tempted to want to put him in because he’s a phenomenal player that’s done a lot in this league,” Sirianni said. “We are going to have to make sure that we’re not putting him in danger.”
The NFL trade deadline is a natural catalyst for some fun hypotheticals.
Of course, most of the deals thrown around will never materialize, and the overwhelming bulk of teams will stand pat or make minor tweaks rather than attempt to make major changes at midseason. But with the cutoff for making deals now is 11 days away, it's only natural to ponder the possibilities, even if a majority of the league's biggest stars will remain in place.
With that in mind, we asked USA TODAY Sports' NFL writers and columnists: Which NFL player – regardless of whether actually on the trade block – is most in need of a change of scenery?
Their answers:
Things have changed dramatically since Davante Adams was traded to his favorite childhood team. His good friend Derek Carr was released, Chandler Jones was exiled, and the Raiders are hovering around the basement of the AFC. Adams has already caught passes from Jimmy Garoppolo, Aidan O'Connell and Brian Hoyer this season.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
The six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver stated last month that it’s not in his "mentality to sit here and try to take all season and figure it out." But it’s become apparent that the Raiders are closer to a being in a rebuild than they are to being a contender, and they don’t have a franchise quarterback on their roster.
Adams was considered by many to be the best wide receiver in the NFL not too long ago. Now it seems as though he’s stuck in the Raiders' black hole, one Las Vegas likely won’t escape for the next few seasons. And the 30-year-old wide receiver doesn’t have all the time to “figure it out.” – Tyler Dragon
Davante Adams is the easy answer here as he’s publicly voiced his frustrations this week. And he’s right. Jimmy Garoppolo has replaced the quarterback he first joined the Raiders to play with in Derek Carr, and Adams is not getting the ball as much as he should. It’s felt like Adams has been working on his cardio in his last two games, producing just six catches on nine targets for 74 yards and no scores. Adams should be the most targeted receiver in the NFL, like he was in Weeks 3 and 4 when he had 33 targets, producing 21 catches for 247 yards and two touchdowns. I don’t see Adams or the Raiders parting ways because of his immense value. Hopefully, Raiders coach Josh McDaniels hears Adams loud and clear, and will find ways to feed his best player. The Raiders are second in the AFC West and could reach the playoffs if Adams is as involved as he wants to be. – Safid Deen
The Denver Broncos are going nowhere fast. They haven’t been helped much at all by 2020 first-round WR Jerry Jeudy, who still doesn’t seem to be vibing with QB Russell Wilson – the results equating to four catches per game for Jeudy and a career-low 44.4 receiving yards per. And with outsiders like NFL Network analyst Steve Smith living rent-free in Jeudy’s head, it just seems like a new team, new mentors, new advisors, new quarterback, et al. might help him reboot what’s largely been a disappointing career to date for the former Alabama star. – Nate Davis
Jeudy, the former Alabama star, could use a fresh start after falling way short of living up to his status as a first-round pick in 2020. While it was reasonable to think that the arrival of Sean Payton earlier this year might ignite the wide receiver's production, that hasn't happened.  In five games, Jeudy's tallied 20 catches for 222, and has zero TDs. The rebuilding Broncos would be gambling big if they invested a fifth-year option on Jeudy, who still hasn't produced a 1,000-yard season in the NFL while being outplayed by fellow first-round receivers in his draft class:  Justin Jefferson, CeeDee Lamb and Brandon Aiyuk. Denver's best option is to deal Jeudy for some future draft capital – and there's no reason that Jeudy should object to that while trying reboot his NFL potential. – Jarrett Bell
I’m also going to go with a receiver, but a different one. We’ve got to get Justin Jefferson into a winning organization. If he’s not the most electric wideout in the game — Tyreek Hill of the Dolphins may have a claim here — Jefferson's not third, we can say that with confidence. Kirk Cousins has been a fine and serviceable quarterback and he has actually developed a solid rapport with Jefferson; last season, Jefferson led the NFL with 1,809 receiving yards and flirted with Calvin Johnson’s single-season record of 1,964. But the problem is what’s happening in the win-loss column.
Minnesota has made the playoffs just once in Jefferson’s three seasons there. That came last year and the Vikings got bounced by a flawed Giants team in the wild card round. The Vikings are now 2-4 and falling behind the Lions in the NFC North. Jefferson is on injured reserve with a hamstring injury. His frustrations with losing are clear on the sideline. He's 24 and is an absolute game breaker. He appears to be craving bigger moments and would thrive on a legitimate contender. Now in the final season of his rookie contract, the Vikings hold leverage via the fifth-year option and, potentially, the franchise tag. If the Vikings can’t turn their performance around, hopefully they can swing a deal and get him to a contender because it would be a treat to watch Jefferson go off in the postseason. – Lorenzo Reyes
Missing the first three games of the season suspended for his role in a Las Vegas assault, Kamara returned to a Saints offense that through six weeks averages 4.6 yards per play (26th in the NFL). Kamara still has a sizable role in the Saints offense, but with quarterback Derek Carr, he is a sitting duck in the passing game. Prior to Thursday night's loss to the Jaguars, his average yards per target was 3.4. His average yards per reception? 3.7, essentially meaning that Kamara has no room to run the ball. Watch one Saints drive and it becomes clear Carr has zero issue using his safety valve in the flat or underneath in Kamara. Unfortunately for the five-time Pro Bowl running back, his touches are baked-in surrender rather than an effort to move the ball. New Orleans should be in playoff contention – thanks to its defense – all season, but Kamara’s effectiveness in both the passing and rushing attacks would be better-suited for a team interested in playing modern offense. – Chris Bumbaca
The Dallas Cowboys won't – and shouldn't – move their No. 1 receiver this year. That much is clear. But it's still a real drag to see a target as dynamic as Lamb get bogged down in a stagnant, uncreative attack that ranks last in the NFL in rate of motion at the snap, according to ESPN. A seven-catch, 117-yard performance in Monday's win over the Los Angeles Chargers helped get the fourth-year pass catcher back on track this season. But the lack of a contract extension for Lamb – as well as Jerry Jones' response of "I don't know about that" when asked last week if he wanted more targets for his top weapon – underscores some troubling signs about Dallas' level of commitment. Don't make the same mistake you did with Amari Cooper, 'Boys. – Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz
Week 7 of the 2023 NFL schedule comes in light, six teams (Bengals, Cowboys, Jets, Panthers, Texans and Titans) breaking for byes.
But a decent slate of games kicks off Thursday with the New Orleans Saints hosting the AFC South-leading Jacksonville Jaguars. No international games this week, so Sunday starts at 1 p.m. ET with a juicy matchup in Baltimore, the Ravens facing the Detroit Lions in a battle of first-place squads.
The "Sunday Night Football" nightcap is the biggie, the Miami Dolphins (5-1) visiting the Philadelphia Eagles (5-1) – decked out anew in Kelly Green – in the latest candidate for game of the year.
Who's 6-1 on Monday? Read on:

FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. – Desmond Ridder was the picture of NFL growing pains as he talked about turning the page on a disastrous ending last weekend while, well, looking ahead to a chance to make a claim on first place.
Ridder, the green Atlanta Falcons quarterback, is coming off the first three-interception game of his young NFL career. That left a lot of explaining for his media session before Wednesday’s practice.
"You try to obviously learn from the mistakes that were made … but you don’t dwell on those interceptions," said Ridder, whose next chance to make amends comes on Sunday at Tampa Bay (3-2) in a matchup that will determine the lead in the NFC South.
Survive long enough as an NFL quarterback and there will be weeks like this. Heat like this, with hot-take analysts suggesting the quarterback take a seat on the bench. The Falcons (3-3) lost an eight-point game against Washington after two of their final three drives ended with picks by the second-year quarterback. The other possession was rather ugly, too; the ball was turned over on downs that included a sack and two incompletions.
Talking turnovers, Ridder, 24, insisted there wasn’t a connecting thread. Was it accuracy or the play design? Bad decisions or bad routes?
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
"There were a couple things on each, where I could’ve made a better read, we could’ve ran a better route, or miscommunication," he said. "Or all three. So, there’s little parts in that entire game – not only with myself but with the whole offense. It’s got to be all 11 guys working on the same page."
In rolling with a young quarterback, the Falcons knew there would be some turbulence along the way with this learning curve. Ridder is surrounded by a strong cast of supporting weapons including first-round picks Bijan Robinson, Kyle Pitts and Drake London. And the defense has improved, allowing them to stay in games.
Yet as natural as it is for the quarterback to attract scrutiny, the crunch-time meltdown on Sunday – which included glaring clock management issues on top of the picks – wasn’t all on Ridder. Arthur Smith, the Falcons coach and play-caller, has fingerprints on this, too.
The Falcons’ operational process during the final minutes was a mess. On at least three occasions, the play-clock nearly ran out as Ridder prepared to call for the snaps. Atlanta probably uses as many personnel packages as any team in the league, which can help create matchup advantages but also requires frequent substitutions. And the unit uses an extensive amount of pre-snap motion, which can also chew up time.
In any event, this stuck out as the issues piled up on Sunday. During one sequence, the flow was so sloppy that after Ridder spiked the football to kill the clock, the Falcons still had to use a timeout as the 25-second play-clock was about to expire.
Asked about the operational issues, Smith fired back with arithmetic.
"Two-thousand plays the last two years," Smith said. "Things happen. They are all different. I wouldn’t call that some catastrophic trend. Now they shouldn’t happen. But they’re all different, why they happened. You identify the problem. But you take three plays out of 2,360…"
But still. It’s what happened lately. The mishaps on Sunday came with the game on the line.
"We can play this game all day," defended Smith, in his third season at the helm. "What about Houston? What about New York?"
In Week 5, the Falcons used a 10-play, 56-yard drive to beat the Texans 21-19 with a Younghoe Koo field goal as time expired. In Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, they executed a 12-play, 66-yard drive for Koo’s game-winning field goal with just under a minute on the clock. The New York game referenced was Smith’s first victory as Falcons coach, in Week 3 in 2021, when his team beat the Giants as then-quarterback Matt Ryan directed a seven-play, 56-yard drive that culminated with a Koo field goal as time expired.
"We’ve won a lot of games handling those situations," Smith added. "Obviously, we didn’t do it last week. We’ve got to get it fixed. This isn’t a trend, a runaway story. Acknowledge what happened. Fix it…Those things happened. That’s not the only reason we lost the game."
Smith pointed to the turnovers, maintaining that NFL teams this season have won just 6% of the games when committing three turnovers.
"Go back to Houston, and those guys executed pretty damn good," Smith said.
Ridder didn’t dispute the mishaps with the operational flow, which typically include the process of getting the play-call from the sideline in addition to the substitutions. He summed it up as a matter of paying better attention to detail, yet he also acknowledged the challenges with communication….especially as the play-clock winds down.
"It makes you speed things up faster," Ridder said. "That’s something we don’t want to do. It goes back to communication. Everybody knowing where they’re supposed to be…just the details with those plays."
Two of Ridder’s teammates, Pitts and London, commended their quarterback for keeping a calm demeanor amid the late-game chaos.
"He’s even-keeled," Pitts said. "When stuff is getting out of control, that’s not when you want to crumble. He’s good at keeping his composure."
Now Ridder – and the rest of his unit – will have to prove capable of growing from the hard lessons.
The soap opera that has consumed members of Congress for nearly three weeks over electing a new speaker is testing the patience of the voters who sent them to Washington, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds.
An overwhelming 67% say the House should elect a speaker as soon as possible, given the need to approve wartime aid for Israel and Ukraine and to prevent a government shutdown that looms next month.
"We got to have a speaker, (but) I don't think we're going to have anybody soon," said George Ramge, 72, of San Diego, a building contractor and political independent. "There's a lot of Hollywood politicians out there getting their time on TV, and I don't think they're really serving the people's purpose."
"They need to be functioning, and that's the only way they're going to function," said Carl Hickey, 85, of Monkton, Maryland, a retired Methodist minister and a Democrat, said in a follow-up interview after being called in the poll.
Just 25% of those surveyed say they don't care whether a speaker is elected, on the theory that the impasse is preventing Congress from wasting more taxpayer money.
"It's not like they do anything anyways," said Dustin Gibbons, 34, a home warranty manager from Queen Creek, Arizona, and a Republican. "I don't think that a speaker in the House is going to do anything other than, you know, just keep kicking that ball along."
The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cell phone Tuesday through Friday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
In a political world where bipartisanship is the exception, there is a broad consensus on this. By double-digit margins, the idea of electing a speaker, and fast, was endorsed not only among Democrats (86%-10%) but also Republicans (57%-34%) and independents (59%-32%).
"How often do you see Democrats, Republicans, and independents agree on anything in DC?" said David Paleologos, director of Suffolk's Political Research Center. "Look at every demographic: gender, geography, age, race, education level, income, political philosophy, even those who trust CNN vs Fox News. They are all speaking the same seven words in unison: 'Elect a speaker and do your job.'"
The previous House speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was ousted from the post by a handful of combative conservatives, just eight of them but enough given the GOP's narrow majority. Since then, no potential successor has been able to command the 217 votes needed. Ohio congressman Jim Jordan was defeated three times before the Republican caucus voted Friday to sideline him.
House Republicans are scheduled to meet late Monday to figure out what to do next.
The scenes of Capitol chaos displayed on cable TV last week may be eroding voters' confidence in the ability of the nation's leaders in the White House and Congress to address the nation's major challenges.
Just 4% of those surveyed express "a lot" of confidence in leaders; another 32% had "some" confidence. But the largest group, 35%, have "very little" confidence and another 27% had none at all.
"If I could go negative five, I would give it a negative 100," Gibbons said.
Democrats, who traditionally have supported a bigger role for government, have more confidence in its ability to solve problems; 63% had "a lot" or "some" confidence.
But Republicans, whose leaders in recent years have portrayed the government as either incompetent or dangerous, were overwhelmingly skeptical that Washington could be trusted to do anything right. A plurality of Republicans, 42%, said they had no confidence in government; another 38% had "very little."
Ratings for the Senate are nothing to brag about, with 36% having a favorable view, and 42% an unfavorable one.
But ratings for the House are even worse. Just 25% see it favorably; more than double that, 54%, view it unfavorably.
Once there is a speaker, most voters have a suggestion of what they want them to do next: A compromise that avoids a government shutdown when the latest temporary funding bill expires Nov. 17.
More than six in 10, 61%, want negotiations to reach a deal. "I mean, don't we live in a bipartisan world?" said Desiree Whitney, 64, of Boerne, Texas, an independent who voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020. "Why should it stop, you know at our government, or does it begin there? I mean, it's all about negotiations."
But there's a catch. While just 31% want their representatives to stand firm on demands to cut spending, even if it means a government shutdown, that group includes a 55% majority of Republicans. Only 37% in the GOP endorse a negotiated compromise.
And Republicans control what happens in the House − assuming, of course, they succeed in electing a speaker.
CORALVILLE — U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, standing on the bed of a bright red truck, delivered a passionate defense of her votes opposing U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan's bid for House speaker — a high-profile break from the majority of House Republicans that she said spawned death threats against her.
“I am never going to quit fighting for Iowa, and I am never going to quit fighting for this country," Miller-Meeks yelled at her annual fundraiser event Friday night. "So if you think you can intimidate me, go … suck it up, buttercup!"
Washington, D.C., was gridlocked this week as House Republicans failed to elect a new speaker. The caucus nominated Jordan, an ultraconservative representative from Ohio.
In the first round of votes, Miller-Meeks and the other three members in Iowa's delegation cast their votes for Jordan — but holdouts from 20 Republicans tanked Jordan's bid. Miller-Meeks explained Friday that she voted to Jordan out of respect for a House rule that members vote on the floor for whoever gets the majority vote in a closed-door conference.
But, she told reporters, she had concerns about whether Jordan could unify the party, and she was worried about the looming threat of a government shutdown.
"I wanted assurances that Republican members of Congress were not going to be attacking other Republicans," Miller-Meeks said. "As soon as the vote was had in conference, and then, not two hours later, we had that coming out."
In the second round of votes on Wednesday, Miller-Meeks withdrew her support for Jordan. She cast her vote Wednesday for U.S. Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, a Republican who chairs the Appropriations Committee.
"Since my vote in support of Chairwoman Granger, I have received credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls," Miller-Meeks said in a statement Wednesday night. "The proper authorities have been notified and my office is cooperating fully."
On Friday, Jordan lost a third floor vote for speaker, with Iowa's delegation voting for him except for Miller-Meeks. Jordan then lost a secret ballot and withdrew his nomination.
Miller-Meeks did not mention the death threats specifically during her speech Friday, but she delivered a passionate defense of her Congressional record.
“I’m not a Democrat. I am a proud Republican," Miller-Meeks said. "Why do I want to get appropriations bills across? … It’s because every one of those appropriations bills has Republican priorities and Republican policies."
Miller-Meeks thanked her office staff for dealing with a "very stressful week." She anticipates House Republicans will successfully choose a speaker "next week."
"We had a vote for speaker, and then I had to rush here to make my own tailgate. And so, there are candidates who have thrown their name into the ring," Miller-Meeks told reporters. "I have told everybody I’m not doing anything until Sunday."

The latest guilty pleas from two key allies in Donald Trump's high-profile Georgia election interference case put new pressure on the former president and raise questions about whether his once-loyal associates may one day flip on him.
Two attorneys, Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell, pleaded guilty to related crimes this week and agreed to testify against other defendants. They had been charged with playing separate roles in an alleged multi-pronged conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Coming after a third defendant, Scott Hall, pleaded guilty in September, their deals bolster the weapons in prosecutors' toolbox, and may pressure other defendants to flip -- a move that would raise the legal stakes for Trump.
''Once you get a couple people pleading, it starts sort of an avalanche of pleas," said Chandelle Summer, a Georgia attorney who previously worked as both a prosecutor and public defender in the state.
In addition to agreeing to testify, Chesebro, Powell, and Hall will turn over relevant documents to the state of Georgia, and are prohibited from communicating with witnesses or defendants in the case.
Norman Eisen, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2020, said information from the three former Trump associates, could bolster the government's evidence in another pending Trump trial -- federal election meddling case, which is scheduled to start in March in Washington.
"Both Powell and Chesebro were unindicted co-conspirators in the federal case, so they're central to it," Eisen said. "It is ominous for the other defendants in the state or federal cases, above all Donald Trump."
Chesebro, an election lawyer, pleaded guilty Friday in the Fulton County Superior Court to a felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. Chesebro offers an inside view of the development of the scheme to recruit fake presidential electors to vote for Trump in states that President Joe Biden won.
Chesebro created and distributed false documents in Georgia and other states for people to submit to the National Archives and Congress posing as presidential electors, according to Daysha Young, the executive district attorney in Fulton County.
"The defendant provided detailed instructions to co-conspirators in Georgia and other states for creating and distributing these false documents," she said.
Chesebro's deal gets the prosecution closer to John Eastman, who around that time appears to have been in "constant communication" with Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump, said Melissa Redmon, a former Fulton County prosecutor who directs the University of Georgia School of Law's Prosecutorial Justice Program.
Those connections will help the state paint a picture for the jury of the false elector activity being ultimately motivated by a desire to make sure Trump retained the presidency "by any means necessary," Redmon said.
Sixteen co-defendants in the Georgia case, including Trump, Eastman and Giuliani, have pleaded not guilty.
Powell, an election lawyer who spread baseless claims of voter fraud, pleaded guilty Thursday to a half-dozen misdemeanors associated with tampering with election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia.
Legal experts said Powell's agreement to provide testimony could have a weighty impact on the wider case because she had significant dealings with Trump, Giuliani, and others.
Powell can also describe how co-defendants tried to overturn the 2020 election. She and Giuliani attended a raucous meeting at the White House with Trump, where they discussed having the military seize voting machines. Trump never acted on the proposal.
Hall, a bail bondsman who served as a go-between for several of the co-defendants, pleaded guilty in September to five misdemeanors dealing with interfering with election duties.
Hall helped SullivanStrickler employees tamper with the Coffee County equipment.
Hall also made multiple calls to co-defendants in the case. For example, Hall spoke with Jeffrey Clark, a former assistant attorney general, for more than an hour Jan. 2, 2021, according to the indictment.
Clark, who pleaded not guilty, is charged with drafting a letter of false statements about Justice Department concerns with the 2020 election, to be sent to Georgia officials. Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to sign or send the letter.
Hall also spoke repeatedly with co-defendants accused of trying to intimidate election workers to change their stories about what happened with ballot counting at State Farm Arena on election night 2020.
Although the pleas open up several months on McAfee's calendar that had been reserved for Powell and Chesebro's trial, Redmon said typically in Fulton County there are several steps involving pre-trial deadlines before a trial date is set in a case, and she doesn't expect to see a trial date for Trump soon.
Summer said McAfee would have to take the schedules for Trump's other criminal trials into account, as well as his attorneys' scheduling conflicts.
"Assuming he's acquitted in the DC case, I think then they'll probably specially set a trial for sometime after that, maybe the fall of 2024," she said.
Eisen suggested McAfee might aim to hold Trump's Georgia trial sooner.
"If Chesebro and Powell could get ready for trial on an accelerated basis, surely it's not too unreasonable for Trump and possibly other defendants to prepare themselves to face a jury in Atlanta at some point in the coming months," Eisen said.
EXETER, N.H. — GOP presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy is leaning on one major message in his pitch to New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary voters: the need to revive a common U.S. national identity. 
“We don’t have to be a nation in decline,” Ramaswamy said at a Republican presidential town hall hosted by the USA TODAY Network, comparing the U.S. to a teenager. “We are just a little young, going through our own version of adolescence, figuring out who we’re really going to be when we grow up.”  
Ramaswamy, who officially filed Wednesday to appear on the Granite State’s Republican primary ballot, argued that half the job of the next U.S. president is to lead the the country out of its ongoing culture wars. The other half, he suggested, will be to steer the policy agenda in Washington.
So what is the 38-year-old political newcomers vision for America's future? During the Exeter, New Hampshire town hall, Ramaswamy laid out his policy priorities to reduce the federal deficit, support Israel and counter China. Here's how his pitch impacts Americans across the country.  
If elected, Ramaswamy told voters that he plans to shut down some major U.S. federal agencies, including the Department of Education.  
"There are certain people, good people, in this race, that will favor incremental reform of the federal government and the bureaucracy," he said. "I'm not in that camp. I favor quantum leap change. I don't believe it is possible to incrementally reform agencies that have existed for a long time." 
Echoing a common Republican talking point, Ramaswamy argued that education decisions should be put in the hands of parents. He said he’d opt to send the department's $80 billion in funding back to taxpayers to “economically empower” them to choose a school for their children.  
“My view is we have a fourth branch of government that is unconstitutional,” Ramaswamy told voters. “The correct answer is shut it down and give the power and the money back to the people.” 
To reduce the $33 trillion in U.S. debt, Ramaswamy floated a zero-based budgeting approach.  
When drafting the annual federal budget, Ramaswamy said he’d “start with zero as the baseline and then ask what’s actually necessary,” rather than referring to the previous year’s budget as a jumping-off point.  
The same tactic was adopted by former President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s but was not found to reduce costs and was later abandoned by former President Ronald Reagan.  
With tensions rising in the war between Israel and Hamas, Ramaswamy last week defended Israel’s right to protect its homeland but cautioned that, as president, he would put American interests at the center of his foreign policy agenda. 
“We have to provide Israel with diplomatic support, munitions support as needed and further even provide them with intelligence sharing,” Ramaswamy told voters gathered at the Exeter town hall. 
Ramaswamy called for providing the support in a way that “avoids broader regional conflict in the Middle East.” The perspective is largely shaped by his views on prior U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
“The Taliban is still in charge in Afghanistan 20 years later and frankly (there is) a hostile anti-American regime in Iraq that's vulnerable to Iranian incursion,” Ramaswamy said. “That didn't advance American interests and we have to own up to that." 
On Ukraine’s war front with Russia, Ramaswamy expressed support for a “reasonable path to peace,” but did not define his views on what that might entail. Previously, the biotech entrepreneur has proposed allowing Russia to keep the Donbas region and requiring Ukraine to concede its attempts to join NATO. 
Describing Vladimir Putin as a “craven dictator,” Ramaswamy told voters in New Hampshire that “just because Russia is bad doesn’t mean Ukraine is good or perfect.” 
He called for reopening relations between the U.S. and Russia and said that such an alliance would help counter China.  
“Do I trust Putin? No. But I do trust him to follow his self-interest,” Ramaswamy told voters. “China’s top bet right now is that the U.S. won’t want to go to war with two allied superpowers at the same time. But if Russia’s no longer in China’s camp then Xi Jinping is going to actually have to think twice.” 
Other Republican presidential candidates have fiercely criticized Ramaswamy’s foreign policy stances. During a confrontation at the first GOP debate, for instance, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley admonished Ramaswamy for his inexperience.  
“You want to go and defund Israel, you want to give Taiwan to China. You want to go and give Ukraine to Russia,” she said. “Under your watch, you will make America less safe.” 
Imagine a young married couple. One partner invests heavily in his employer’s 401(k), saving for both spouses. The other focuses on paying the bills and contributes nothing to her retirement plan, missing out on the employer's matching funds.
That was how Niv Persaud and her husband handled their finances.
“My income was going toward our expenses, and he was going to focus on retirement,” she said. “And I had a great company match, and I didn’t pay attention to that.”
The marriage eventually ended. Three decades later, Persaud works as a certified financial planner in Atlanta. Her lost retirement savings provide a cautionary tale.

“I don’t even want to think about it,” she said.
In fact, one in four married couples fails to take full advantage of employers who make matching contributions to 401(k) retirement plans, a recent study found. The oversight costs them nearly $700 a year, on average.
Nearly two-thirds of American workers have access to an employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement savings plan, according to the paper, titled “Efficiency in Household Decision Making: Evidence from the Retirement Savings of U.S. Couples,” and released in April by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Most plans offer a match: The employer contributes to a 401(k), matching some or all of the funds paid into the plan by the worker. In one typical model, the employer matches half of every dollar a worker contributes, up to a maximum of 6% of the worker’s pay.
The study found that about 24% of married couples left money on the table by failing to claim some of an employer’s matching funds. Those couples lost $682 a year, on average, money they could recover simply by changing the allocation of their retirement contributions. The findings are based on IRS tax data and retirement plan descriptions.
“There’s a lot of advice around, ‘You should save more,’” said Taha Choukhmane, an assistant professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. “It’s not just how much you save. It’s how you save, and where you save.”
Choukhmane co-authored the working paper with Cormac O’Dea, an assistant professor of economics at Yale, and Lucas Goodman, an economist at the Treasury Department.
The researchers stressed that their focus was not on couples that don’t save for retirement, or don’t save enough. Instead, they looked at couples that could increase their savings merely by shifting contributions from one spouse to the other.
“You don’t need to save more. You don’t need to change how you spend,” Choukhmane said. “It’s all about how you allocate money across accounts.”
In some couples, the researchers found, only one spouse contributed to a retirement plan, while the other ignored a plan with a generous employer match. Other couples split retirement savings equally when they should have put more money into an account with a larger match.
“The 401(k) is really designed around individuals,” Choukhmane said. “And I think a lot of people need to realize that this is not about the individual.”
The new study underscores a lack of cooperation between spouses on an important matter of household finance. The researchers said it also speaks to the broader issue of financial communication in marriage.
“It does open up a question of what other big decisions couples are not coordinating on,” O’Dea, the assistant professor at Yale, said.
The researchers found that couples that had been married longer, and couples with children, tended to do a better job at communicating and coordinating retirement savings. Couples in shorter relationships did worse.
Couples headed for divorce were also less likely to coordinate their retirement contributions. The researchers discovered this by studying the saving patterns of marriages that ended in divorce.
Investment advisers often recommend that American workers save 10% to 15% of their pre-tax income for retirement. They also urge them to max out any matching funds from the employer, which boosts the worker’s effective savings rate.
If a company matches up to 6% of your salary in 401(k) contributions, "maxing out" means contributing at least that much of your annual pay.
“The first priority for any investor should be to save enough to get at least the entire employer match,” said Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at Charles Schwab.
Yet, many partners leave the money untapped. Vanguard, for example, reports that 31% of its retirement plan participants failed to claim some or all of an employer’s matching funds in 2022.
Retirement savings rates are lower for younger workers, whose retirement falls in the more distant future. Among Vanguard participants, the retirement savings rate in 2022 ranged from 5.2% for workers under 25 to 9% for those over 65.
Many Americans of all ages have struggled to save in the last two years when inflation reached a 40-year high.
More on inflation's bite:High costs disrupt life in more ways than we can see
In the 2023 Retirement Confidence Survey, conducted by the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute, 84% of workers voiced concern that the rising cost of living will make it harder for them to save money for retirement.
An employer match may not seem like much money.
“People look at it and say, ‘It’s only 3%,’” said James Gambaccini, a certified financial planner in Reston, Virginia. But “it’s a 100% match up to 3% of your salary.”
The formula Gambaccini describes, matching the employee’s full retirement contribution up to 3% of their pay, would double a 3% contribution to 6% without the worker spending another dollar. An employee with a $50,000 salary would see a $1,500 contribution grow to $3,000.
As the holiday season approaches, two major grocery chains have announced they are reducing prices to help customers deal with inflation.
On Wednesday, Walmart announced it will be "removing inflation," offering Thanksgiving meals at lower prices than in 2022, according a press release. The supermarket giant will offer two Thanksgiving meal options this year: one with ingredients for customers who like to cook from scratch, and one for customers who prefer more ready-to-bake options.
Walmart's Thanksgiving meal basket includes main dishes and sides options from national brands, including turkey for under $1 a pound, ham, stuffing and pumpkin pie. Theses baskets can be purchased through Walmart's website or app for pickup or delivery.
These holiday prices don't just apply to Thanksgiving: Walmart's deals begin Nov. 1 and are valid through Dec. 26, 2023.
Aldi has also turned its focus toward holiday prices, announcing Wednesday that it will reduce the price on over 70 items around the store by up to 50%.
The price reductions include seasonal items like gravy, potatoes, green beans, cranberries and pumpkin pie, according to a press release, but also includes kitchen staples like butter and flour.
Aldi's price reductions will begin Nov. 1 and last through the end of the year.
Food:Kraft Mac & Cheese ice cream is back at Walmart next week along with six new flavors by Van Leeuwen
USA TODAY has reported that annual inflation has fallen this year since hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.
Bu- tit was reported at 3.7% in September, well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
Consumer price increases stayed high in September, and there was a small rise in gasoline and food costs.
Chick-fil-A releases cookbook:will combine fan-favorite menu items with household ingredients
CVS is pulling over-the-counter allergy and cold medicines that contain the most popular decongestant ingredient from its shelves. The ingredient, phenylephrine, was found to be no more effective than a placebo when taken orally by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month.
"We are removing a small number of oral decongestant products that contain phenylephrine as the only active ingredient from CVS Pharmacy stores but will continue offering many other oral cough and cold products to meet consumer needs," a spokesperson for CVS Health told USA TODAY in a statement.
Phenylephrine can be found in name brand decongestants such as Sudafed and Dayquil, and became the primary ingredient in most of these medications after a 2006 law limited access to pseudoephedrine, which can be used to make methamphetamine.
Products like Dayquil will remain on CVS shelves since they have a combination of active ingredients.
More:FDA panel declares decongestant phenylephrine ineffective. What it is and what products contain it
Since 2007, the efficacy of phenylephrine to provide nasal congestion relief has been challenged.
In September, the group of FDA-assembled advisors unanimously voted oral phenylephrine ineffective "a thorough review of" data going back to 1994, and that the drug metabolizes in the body before it reaches the nasal passages. The panel vote is not a medical determination.
There were no safety issues found with taking oral phenylephrine.
The experts said some potential benefits of removing the ingredient include "lowering of overall healthcare costs, and avoiding missed opportunities for use of more effective treatments" like going to the doctor.
Medications with phenylephrine generated $1.8 billion in sales last year, according to the FDA report.
Not all pharmacy chains will remove products. In a statement to USA TODAY, a Rite Aid spokesperson said the company will keep those over-the-counter medications on its shelves:
"Our pharmacists are available to provide guidance to customers on over-the-counter solutions for alleviating symptoms associated with colds and other illnesses."

Many of us have been there before: waking in the middle of the night, often in response to a dream or nightmare, afraid and covered in perspiration. 
While sweating has many benefits, such as being a "natural function that the body uses to regulate body temperature," explains Jewel Kling, MD, assistant director of women's health for Mayo Clinic, it can also be a source of concern. 
For instance, some people worry that their sweat causes body odor, while others fret that their obvious sweating is a sign they're nervous or anxious (which it may well be, but they don't want others to know that). But for people who sweat a lot at night, perspiration can be especially disruptive to a healthy sleep schedule, and even costly due to the amount of laundry it can create. 
Nights sweats are repeated episodes of very excessive sweating that occur during sleep - often heavy enough to soak through nightclothes or bedding, per Mayo Clinic. Such episodes can occur whether one's sleeping environment is hot or cold. 
"Night sweats can range from moderate to excessive with drenching sweats," explains Kling. Like episodes of excessive sweating that can occur during the day, night sweats are usually considered generalized hyperhidrosis, or heavy sweating. Such perspiration can happen on its own or it may be accompanied by an illness such as fever or nausea. 
While various things can cause or contribute to night sweats including medication and medical conditions, "it is recommended that when you frequently experience night sweat, you have it evaluated by your clinician to identify the cause," suggests Kling. 
Another such cause many include hormonal changes like menopause, which can make it hard for the brain to regulate body temperature, often causing night sweat. Infection can contribute as well; as can night terrors or bad dreams. "Stress, increased heart rate, and other stimuli can trigger night sweating," says Anthony Beutler, MD, an associate medical director of sports medicine at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City.
Other culprits of night sweats include vitamin B12 deficiency, excess weight, dysfunction within the autonomic nervous system or certain disorders of the endocrine system such as thyroid disease. 
And each such factor can lead to different degrees of night sweating. "The composition of sweat varies considerably, depending on its cause," explains Loren Fishman, MD, a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Columbia University.  
It's also worth noting that night sweat is not the same as exercise-related sweat in a couple distinct ways. "The chemical composition of perspiration from night sweats, like that from other emotional or endocrine causes, is different in its chemical composition from exercise-induced perspiration," says Fishman. To explain this, he says that sweat from normal activity is higher in lactate - a product of metabolism - than the sweat produced while sleeping.
Kling adds that night sweat and exercise-related sweat also have different functions, even if the mechanisms that lead to perspiration are similar. "Exercise-related sweating is triggered by the body during exercise to control body temperature," she explains. "Night sweats are typically caused by something else."

When you're messaging someone, you don't want to overload them with information. Sometimes, sending a lengthy paragraph can feel like too much. You also may want to avoid the dreaded "double text," or in some cases, triple or quadruple text.
This is where slang and abbreviations come in to help. There is a whole library of examples at your fingertips – from "ily" and "rizz" to "OP" and "fwiw."
"ICYMI", USA TODAY has been breaking down text slang. Now, it's time to learn a new one. Here is the meaning and how to use "fyi."
"FYI" stands for "for your information." When used, the term notifies others about something that is important or significant.
The abbreviation can be used in both formal and informal messaging, such as via email to relay a deadline at work or while texting a friend about some interesting gossip.
The usage of "FYI" can be traced back to the 1930s when it was used by journalists to denote that the messages – or parts of the messages – they sent were for the recipient only, not for public viewing, according to Grammarly.
Here are some examples of how to use "fyi":

While only 12.3% of U.S. adults meet the recommended fruit and vegetable intake, the grains group isn’t one that Americans have trouble getting enough of, MyPlate says. Grains show up in many parts of our day – cereals and bagels in the morning, sandwiches at lunchtime, rice at dinner or popcorn while watching a movie. 
But while the quantity may not be an issue, the quality is: the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends more of your grain intake be from whole grains than refined.
Here are the healthiest options within that whole grain category.
Grains are an important source of fiber, B vitamins, complex carbohydrates and minerals like iron, magnesium and selenium. The carbohydrates in grains are crucial because they’re “direct and easy sources of energy for your body” says registered dietitian Chris Mohr.
While all whole grains will provide these nutrients, there are a few that stand out. Farro, oats and quinoa may be the healthiest grains because of their heavy fiber content. 
“Fiber’s not the sexiest nutrient to talk about because of the benefits, but it’s critical for health,” Mohr says.
Dietary fiber helps you feel fuller, aids in digestion and helps prevent constipation. Research presented at the 2021 American Society for Nutrition conference found fewer than 1 in 10 U.S. adults meet their daily fiber recommendations. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating 28 grams of fiber per day based on a 2,000-calorie diet. 
You’re also getting protein with these three options. A serving of oats (100 grams) contains nearly 17 grams of protein and 10.6 grams of fiber. A serving of farro of the same size contains 15.4 grams of protein and 6.6 grams of fiber. For cooked quinoa, it’s about 3 grams of fiber and 4.4 grams of protein. 
For comparison’s sake, the same portion of white rice contains about 2.7 grams of protein and 0.4 grams of fiber.
But while these three are great options, Mohr says you ideally want to eat a variety of grains to get different nutrients.
The USDA recommends at least half your daily grain intake be whole grains, which contain more vitamins and nutrients than refined grains. Mohr says we shouldn’t be scared of refined grains but should make sure they’re enriched.
The refinement process gives grains a finer texture and longer shelf life – we see this in cereal, white flour, white bread and white rice, for example. Today, many refined grains are enriched, which means they add back nutrients like B vitamins and iron but not fiber. Enriched, refined grains do add folic acid, however, which Mohr says even whole grains don’t include as much of in their natural form.
Folic acid is recommended during pregnancy because of its role in DNA and RNA formation, but it’s important for everyone. The benefits of folate include improved digestive system functioning and preventing common cancers, cardiovascular disease, infertility, stroke, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
“That’s why it’s important to make sure that you are getting even some refined grains because they are enriched specifically with folic acid,” Mohr says. 
Check the packaging or nutrition labels to tell if a refined grain is enriched. Organic products may not be fortified. 
What is the healthiest bread?:One is best, but you've got plenty of options
To understand whole grains, you first have to understand grain kernel anatomy. The kernel is made of three parts:
Whole grains are just as they sound – the entire grain kernel remains intact. When you refine grains, it strips the grain of the bran and germ and uses just the inside endosperm. This removes most of the grain's vitamins, minerals, fiber and protein. 
It’s important to know how to look for whole grains when you’re grocery shopping. You can’t use a darker color as a judge, because breads and other grain products are sometimes dyed with molasses, according to Mohr. You have to look at the ingredient list.
“You want the words ‘whole grain’ to be at the beginning of the ingredient list,” he says. 
The easiest swap is to consciously add in more whole grain products to tip you over to that “more than half” whole grain recommendation. This could be trying whole grain bread instead of whole wheat or white bread, having brown rice or wild rice every once in a while if you normally eat white rice or looking for whole grain bagel options, Mohr says. 
Whole grain cereals can be another good addition to your mornings – routinely consuming ready-to-eat cereals, especially whole grain ones, is associated with significant increases in overall dietary fiber intake.
What foods are high in fiber?:Add these in to get enough

If you struggle with blemished or aging skin, or from a skin condition such as acne, chances are you've tried many natural remedies to help. These may have included apple cider vinegar, vitamin supplements, essential oils or even a viral honey and cinnamon mask you may have seen trending on social media. 
But chances are, you've also turned to prescription and over-the-counter medications or topical applications in an attempt to find a solution. While there are many products offered by the $146-billion-dollar skin-care industry which include vitamin C serum and a host of lotions and creams, few such products or ingredients are more sought after than retinol. 
Retinol is a form of the fat-soluble nutrient vitamin A, and is a popular ingredient in skin cream topicals for its anti-aging effects. It's a type of retinoid - chemical compounds derived from vitamin A or chemically related to it - but is unique in that most retinoids are considered powerful enough to require a prescription while the retinol formula is mild enough to be available in over-the-counter form.
"Retinol is most commonly applied topically and only a small amount is needed," explains Dustin Portela, DO, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Treasure Valley Dermatology in Boise, Idaho. "To my patients, I recommend using a pea-size amount of cream or gel, or about four drops of the serum, to cover the whole face." 
Though retinol is mainly used as a lotion, cream, gel or serum, retinol-related medications can be taken orally as well to treat skin conditions and to help "prevent skin cancers in patients at higher risk of skin malignancies," says Anna Chien, MD, a board-certified dermatologist practicing in Columbia, Maryland, and an associate professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
Retinol is effective in a number of ways. It can unclog pores (and thereby improve acne), neutralize free radicals and exfoliate one's skin. "Retinol acts inside your skin cells on several different molecular pathways to help improve the skin's appearance," explains Portela. In this way, he says it can help boost collagen production and also minimize wrinkles and fine lines. 
Chien says that retinol can also improve skin turnover, decrease the size of sebaceous glands (glands found in hair follicles that secrete the oily substance sebum), even out pigmentation, decrease skin proliferation, improve skin texture and protect against signs of aging. Because of such varied functions, "it's used topically for acne, skin aging, discoloration and for certain skin diseases such as psoriasis," she says. 
While many people reap such benefits without experiencing side effects, "retinol does come with some risks," says Portela. He says the most common one is irritation of the skin. "It can disrupt the moisture barrier if you use too much or too strong of a retinol for your skin type," he cautions. 
Another area of concern is that it's possible for retinol to increase one's sensitivity to the sun. Because of this, "it is especially important to wear a daily sunscreen if you have incorporated retinol into your skin care routine," Portela advises. Retinol is also not generally recommended for use while pregnant.
When it comes to decreasing retinol's side effects related to skin irritation, Chien says that can "be managed with careful titration of its usage (combined with) a gentle skin care routine."

The blood libel isn’t new – but it is terrifying to see it spread across the world in the wake of the Hamas massacre, its reach expanded and its impact intensified by shoddy news coverage of this crisis.
Palestinian terror groups’ false accusation that Israeli forces destroyed a hospital in Gaza was instantly covered as fact by journalists. As the unconfirmed allegation was highlighted in headlines, news feeds and push notifications, the reaction was immediate, threatening Jewish communities around the world.
This happened even as the allegation was quickly rebutted by the Israeli government. And U.S. sources have said that the missile likely was fired from within Gaza by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a local terror organization that essentially serves as a junior version of Hamas.
As the sun rose, it became clear that, while the misfired missile had claimed casualties, the hospital had not been flattened. Indeed, independent experts assessed that it had been set ablaze by an explosion on the ground.
Based on overhead imagery, communications intercept and open-source data, governmental and nongovernmental sources confirmed that the damage likely had been caused by a rocket fired by terrorists inside Gaza. But it was far, far too late.
Journalists' knee-jerk assumption that Israel bombed a hospital already had attained escape velocity, traveling around the world and inflaming hatred along the way.
It was expected for Arab media to report the lie. Outlets like Al Jazeera has dispensed with any pretense of objectivity.
But it was even more damning to see Western media, including the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, jump on the Hamas-driven charge and spread it without the normal processes that ensure the integrity of their reporting.
“Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinians Say,” blared a headline in The Times (later changed to “Israelis and Palestinians Blame Each Other for Blast at Gaza Hospital That Killed Hundreds.”)
In addition, reputable newspapers such as The Washington Post and news organizations such as The Associated Press and Reuters amplified the accusatory claims.
The level of incompetence was staggering – and dangerous.
In the 24 hours after the incident, the misinformation fueled a wave of antisemitic hate. There are almost too many examples to count. A synagogue in Germany was firebombed. Anti-Israel protesters descended on the U.S. Capitol and flooded Amman, Jordan; Beirut, Lebanon; and other capitals. This is just the beginning. 
Some, but not all, news outlets have backtracked on the claim and corrected the record. Fortunately, no one has been killed as a direct result of this irresponsible coverage. But the odds seem likely that people might be killed if this kind of misreporting reoccurs.

How does this happen?
When Hamas makes a claim, media outlets must ask hard questions. As a terrorist organization that forbids free speech and outlaws open expression, it has a track record of spreading lies and propaganda. Its leaders actively engage in information warfare, using all the means at their disposal.
For example, rather than cite the Ministry of Health in Gaza as a source, it would be more accurate to reference it as the Hamas Health Ministry, because it is an arm of the terrorist government. Outlets also should stop referring to Hamas operatives as “fighters” or “militants.” They are unrepentant terrorists whose malevolence is confirmed by more than 1,400 body bags in Israel, let alone the over 200 hostages, ranging from infants to the elderly, held against their will in the Gaza Strip.
Hamas invaded my brother's home.Now, my family is held hostage in Gaza.
But the problem is not just the official Hamas line. Western news agencies cannot operate bureaus in Gaza as they do in Israel and other democracies around the world. Reporters are not allowed to roam around and pursue stories at will. Instead, Hamas restricts who can report on the situation – and who cannot.
It is time for journalists to acknowledge their accountability in this crisis. Irresponsible reporting can enable the spread of a modern-day blood libel. The blood libel is an ancient charge, a pernicious myth that Jewish people intentionally kill non-Jews for any number of reasons.
An ancient form of fake news, the blood libel fueled antisemitic pogroms in Europe and was later imported to the Middle East.
Today, we see the blood libel in full effect when the world recklessly blames Israel for any number of crimes. It proliferates when, in this delicate moment, major media outlets fail to apply the normal checks and balances used to minimize misinformation. It has always been dangerous, but it is even more explosive in the Information Age because Jews around the world will be the victims.
As the Hamas war rages and tensions rise, media services around the world must take responsibility and prevent false information from spreading and fanning the flames of hate.

As we can see in Ukraine and now the Middle East, wars of aggression, acts of genocide, tyranny and terrorist atrocities do not happen in isolation.
From the seeds of a strong-arm regime in Germany, sprouted with virulent antisemitism, came the continentwide extermination of Jews. The shadows of the Holocaust loom large, with contemporary Western society constructed upon the principle of "never again." Yet, disturbingly, echoes of the past resurface as Jewish populations face vile antisemitism in Europe and America, and calls for "peace" mask veiled justifications for Hamas' heinous acts, which, at their core, revel in cruelty and degradation.
The Soviet Union's oppressive legacy endures. Bosnian genocide, Yugoslav wars, poverty, oligarchism, Russian invasions of Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine – all of these didn’t happen out of nowhere. Countless individuals, particularly in Eastern Europe and notably Ukraine, grapple with fractured family histories and tales of ancestors deported, killed or incarcerated. Such generational trauma requires immense time and understanding to be fully addressed and healed. 
The Syrian war, with its novel brand of horror, did not emerge spontaneously. The alliance between Hezbollah, a notorious Lebanese terrorist entity, and Russia, which at that point was a widely accepted partner of the free world, started in 2015 in Syria and has not stopped.
Now, the repercussions of every past atrocity reverberate globally. The same culprits, repeatedly emboldened, perpetrate murder, torture and degradation as the world seeks reassurance and the illusion of peace.
Hamas, responsible for the deaths of entire Israeli families, finds camaraderie in Moscow. Syria's Assad regime deploys chemical warfare on its populace, bolstered by Hezbollah and Russia. Hezbollah launches assaults on Israel, underpinned by its intricate ties with Iran, Syria and Russia.
Russia's savage invasion of Ukraine persists, with Iranians providing applause and weaponry. African nations are inundated with propaganda, giving a stage to ruthless Russian mercenaries – while China quietly acquires the continent piece by piece. And China's menacing stance toward Taiwan, combined with its support for Russia's aggression toward Ukraine, signals a broader threat to the free world.
This vicious cycle offers no genuine peace. 
Ukraine working to document war crimes:Ukrainians need America's help to hold Russian war criminals accountable for atrocities
Regrettably, the free world isn't merely an idle observer. Much of the technology utilized by Russia and terrorist factions originates in the West.
Billions in humanitarian aid have flowed into Gaza, only to line the pockets of Hamas leaders living lavishly in Qatar or to finance militants who funnel these funds into weapon smuggling. European aid items, including water pipes, have been repurposed by Hamas to fashion missiles aimed at Israel. 
Microelectronics are incorporated into missiles that wreak havoc upon civilians in Ukraine and anywhere else terrorists enact their terror. Despite bans, embargoes and sanctions on international companies, Russia continues to utilize Western tools to manufacture advanced weaponry – the very same machines that still benefit from maintenance by their manufacturers, such as German-Japanese DMG Mori or American Haas Automation.
Why do these companies persist in servicing equipment instrumental in aiding a nation led by an accused war criminal to produce arms? Greed appears to be the likeliest culprit. Such convenient "ignorance" of the end-users (Russian arms manufacturers) does not make an excuse for silent war crimes enablers.
To those who argue that Europe or the United States should abstain from intervening in distant conflicts, a sobering reality check is due: Their involvement is already apparent, just not in a way most of the people imagine. This is evidenced by the surging exports to nations that orbit Russia – for instance, German exports to Kyrgyzstan soared by 949% last year, according to a Reuters analysis, with a significant proportion finding its way to Russia.
Moreover, the inability to curtail purchases of Russian resources, such as the U.S. acquisition of uranium from Rosatom, effectively bankrolls the adversary's military operations.
Concurrently, China capitalizes on its position as the manufacturing hub for Western tech, striving to replicate and pilfer Western innovations. 
Stop following China.United Nations is ruled by 'we the peoples,' not authoritarian regimes.
The sobering truth is that countries such as China, Iran, Belarus and Russia are already waging a covert war against the free world, and it's high time the latter acknowledged this reality and stopped fighting against itself.
True global tranquility remains elusive until the world recognizes that witnessing brutality is never a standalone event. The civilizational war has started, and it’s time for all to choose their allegiance.

Ethics can be difficult.
Except when they’re not.
Except they will be.
Because this is Arizona.
For example, soon to come before the Arizona Supreme Court is a case that could revive an 1864, pre-statehood abortion ban that mandates as much as a five-year prison term for providers.
Among the seven members of the court who will decide that case is Bill Montgomery, a hyper-political, hyper-partisan, virulent anti-abortion former prosecutor appointed by former Gov. Doug Ducey.
The Arizona Mirror and The 19th (a nonprofit, independent news operation out of Austin, Texas) noted in an article that Montgomery said in the past that Planned Parenthood (whose lawyers are arguing against reinstating the 1864 law) “is responsible for the greatest genocide known to man.”
Now for the ethics part. And please, try not to laugh out loud when you read the next sentence.
Arizona has an official “Code of Judicial Conduct.”
(I can hear you.)
Anyway, Rule 2.11 of that code, under “Disqualification,” reads in part, “A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned … .”
Montgomery didn’t only make the “genocide” comment. He was never shy about his feelings.
I never expected I'd need an abortion.Our outdated laws made me pay for it myself.
At a protest in front of Planned Parenthood’s offices a few years back, he said, “Today’s protest calls for several specific goals. We call for Congress to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood. There is no reason to fund this charade of women’s health care any longer. The profit-driven atrocities must end and America must not fund them anymore.”
Seems pretty clear that Montgomery’s “impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” And that he should disqualify himself.
Except, perhaps, in Arizona.
This isn’t new. Former Gov. Ducey first increased the number of judges on the Supreme Court from five to seven (when no one said it was needed), then stacked the court with partisans like Montgomery.
Republicans controlled Arizona.Then Turning Point USA tried to help.
The first time Montgomery came up for consideration, Chief Justice Scott Bales told Montgomery, “One broad statement is that you have very strongly held beliefs that have been expressed in different settings, which give people concerns about your ability as a judge to be fair.”
When the former prosecutor didn’t make the cut that time around, Ducey rigged the supposedly neutral system for selecting judicial candidates to pick the judges he wanted, like Montgomery.
When Montgomery was under consideration, Scott O’Connor, the son of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, said selecting someone like him for the state’s highest court “will do no service to the public’s faith in the judicial system.”
What would bolster the public’s faith in the judicial system?
Ethics.
But ethics can be difficult.
Except when they’re not.
Except they will be.
Because this is Arizona.

Lawyers all over the state of Tennessee are scratching their heads about the Michael Oher conservatorship and the ensuing litigation.
On Aug. 9, 2004, a lawyer in Hernando, Mississippi, filed a petition on behalf of Sean Tuohy and his wife, Leigh Anne Tuohy, to be appointed conservators over Michael Oher (the “Respondent”). The petition states that the court should grant the Tuohys “full co-legal custody, guardianship and conservatorship” over Oher.
Although the petition asks that the Tuohys be named conservators over “the person” of Oher, which would mean they would have the power to make decisions about healthcare, they also requested that Oher not be allowed to enter into any contracts on his own behalf.
The petition goes on to say that Michael Oher “has no known physical of psychological disabilities.” The petition is signed by the Tuohys, by Oher’s mother and by Oher.
Three months later, without any further pleadings being filed, the judge awarded the Tuohys the ability to make all medical decisions for Oher. His right to enter into contracts was also taken away and given to the Tuohys.
For the next 19 years, the court never required any proof of disability nor did the court require accountings or annual status reports.
This is not how the law of conservatorship works in Tennessee. A court is required to find by clear and convincing evidence, based at least in part on the report of a physician, that the respondent is fully or partially disabled and that he or she is in need of assistance from the court. Rights are then removed from the respondent and vested in the conservator.
Conservatorship system devours dignity:After Britney Spears' abusive conservatorship, don't reform the system – abolish it
There is no “custody” or adoption proceeding that goes along with a conservatorship. The Tuohys could have adopted Oher, even though he had reached 18 years of age. An adoption, however, is fundamentally different than conservatorships and does not remove any rights from a child.
Under Tennessee law, conservators are required to file an accounting and a status report once a year. No accountings or status reports were ever filed in the Oher case.
In August, 2023, 19 years later, Michael Oher filed his own petition to terminate the conservatorship and require the Tuohys to account to him.
The Tuohys have filed an answer. They claim that they never told Oher that they were going to adopt him and that their sole motivation in pursuing the conservatorship was to enable Oher to play for the University of Mississippi (“Ole Miss”), which would have been forbidden under NCAA recruiting rules if they were supporting Oher and he was not a part of their family. They state that they referred to Oher as a son, felt that he was like a son, and “have used that on occasion but not in the legal sense.”
Prison reform gives second chance:First Step Act advanced prison reform, but hundreds are still serving unjust sentences
My very limited research shows that the Tuohys have a book on Amazon for which they are listed as co-authors and which is called: “In a Heartbeat:  Sharing the Power of Cheerful Giving.”  The description of the book refers to the “remarkable couple depicted in ‘The Blind Side’” and the “story of Michael Oher and the family who adopted him.”
The judge over the Oher case in Memphis, Kathleen N. Gomes, entered an order at the end of September terminating the conservatorship but retaining the other issues, i.e., Oher’s action for accountings and damages.
More will be revealed as this lawsuit progresses, but the case is disturbing. An 18-year-old could be confused by the language of the original petition which refers to guardianship and custody along with conservatorship. Moreover, the Tuohys seem to have profited from the story about adopting Oher in many ways, only one of which may have been financial.

Many of us have been there before: waking in the middle of the night, often in response to a dream or nightmare, afraid and covered in perspiration. 
While sweating has many benefits, such as being a "natural function that the body uses to regulate body temperature," explains Jewel Kling, MD, assistant director of women's health for Mayo Clinic, it can also be a source of concern. 
For instance, some people worry that their sweat causes body odor, while others fret that their obvious sweating is a sign they're nervous or anxious (which it may well be, but they don't want others to know that). But for people who sweat a lot at night, perspiration can be especially disruptive to a healthy sleep schedule, and even costly due to the amount of laundry it can create. 
Nights sweats are repeated episodes of very excessive sweating that occur during sleep - often heavy enough to soak through nightclothes or bedding, per Mayo Clinic. Such episodes can occur whether one's sleeping environment is hot or cold. 
"Night sweats can range from moderate to excessive with drenching sweats," explains Kling. Like episodes of excessive sweating that can occur during the day, night sweats are usually considered generalized hyperhidrosis, or heavy sweating. Such perspiration can happen on its own or it may be accompanied by an illness such as fever or nausea. 
While various things can cause or contribute to night sweats including medication and medical conditions, "it is recommended that when you frequently experience night sweat, you have it evaluated by your clinician to identify the cause," suggests Kling. 
Another such cause many include hormonal changes like menopause, which can make it hard for the brain to regulate body temperature, often causing night sweat. Infection can contribute as well; as can night terrors or bad dreams. "Stress, increased heart rate, and other stimuli can trigger night sweating," says Anthony Beutler, MD, an associate medical director of sports medicine at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City.
Other culprits of night sweats include vitamin B12 deficiency, excess weight, dysfunction within the autonomic nervous system or certain disorders of the endocrine system such as thyroid disease. 
And each such factor can lead to different degrees of night sweating. "The composition of sweat varies considerably, depending on its cause," explains Loren Fishman, MD, a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Columbia University.  
It's also worth noting that night sweat is not the same as exercise-related sweat in a couple distinct ways. "The chemical composition of perspiration from night sweats, like that from other emotional or endocrine causes, is different in its chemical composition from exercise-induced perspiration," says Fishman. To explain this, he says that sweat from normal activity is higher in lactate - a product of metabolism - than the sweat produced while sleeping.
Kling adds that night sweat and exercise-related sweat also have different functions, even if the mechanisms that lead to perspiration are similar. "Exercise-related sweating is triggered by the body during exercise to control body temperature," she explains. "Night sweats are typically caused by something else."

If you struggle with blemished or aging skin, or from a skin condition such as acne, chances are you've tried many natural remedies to help. These may have included apple cider vinegar, vitamin supplements, essential oils or even a viral honey and cinnamon mask you may have seen trending on social media. 
But chances are, you've also turned to prescription and over-the-counter medications or topical applications in an attempt to find a solution. While there are many products offered by the $146-billion-dollar skin-care industry which include vitamin C serum and a host of lotions and creams, few such products or ingredients are more sought after than retinol. 
Retinol is a form of the fat-soluble nutrient vitamin A, and is a popular ingredient in skin cream topicals for its anti-aging effects. It's a type of retinoid - chemical compounds derived from vitamin A or chemically related to it - but is unique in that most retinoids are considered powerful enough to require a prescription while the retinol formula is mild enough to be available in over-the-counter form.
"Retinol is most commonly applied topically and only a small amount is needed," explains Dustin Portela, DO, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Treasure Valley Dermatology in Boise, Idaho. "To my patients, I recommend using a pea-size amount of cream or gel, or about four drops of the serum, to cover the whole face." 
Though retinol is mainly used as a lotion, cream, gel or serum, retinol-related medications can be taken orally as well to treat skin conditions and to help "prevent skin cancers in patients at higher risk of skin malignancies," says Anna Chien, MD, a board-certified dermatologist practicing in Columbia, Maryland, and an associate professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
Retinol is effective in a number of ways. It can unclog pores (and thereby improve acne), neutralize free radicals and exfoliate one's skin. "Retinol acts inside your skin cells on several different molecular pathways to help improve the skin's appearance," explains Portela. In this way, he says it can help boost collagen production and also minimize wrinkles and fine lines. 
Chien says that retinol can also improve skin turnover, decrease the size of sebaceous glands (glands found in hair follicles that secrete the oily substance sebum), even out pigmentation, decrease skin proliferation, improve skin texture and protect against signs of aging. Because of such varied functions, "it's used topically for acne, skin aging, discoloration and for certain skin diseases such as psoriasis," she says. 
While many people reap such benefits without experiencing side effects, "retinol does come with some risks," says Portela. He says the most common one is irritation of the skin. "It can disrupt the moisture barrier if you use too much or too strong of a retinol for your skin type," he cautions. 
Another area of concern is that it's possible for retinol to increase one's sensitivity to the sun. Because of this, "it is especially important to wear a daily sunscreen if you have incorporated retinol into your skin care routine," Portela advises. Retinol is also not generally recommended for use while pregnant.
When it comes to decreasing retinol's side effects related to skin irritation, Chien says that can "be managed with careful titration of its usage (combined with) a gentle skin care routine." 
Acne treatments abound but what work?An expert gets into skincare essentials
Seven months ago, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill student Elizabeth Grace Burton died two days after overdosing on a blend of drugs and alcohol, according to the Assembly, which was the first to report her death this week. 
A state autopsy report said Burton, 19, died of a brain injury caused by cardiac arrest following ingestion of a toxic mix of cocaine and alcohol, while a private autopsy also found fentanyl and Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) — a depressant known for its euphoric and calming effects — in Burton’s system. (The state report detected fentanyl in Burton’s urine, but officials did not say it contributed to her death.)
The university’s director of student wellness Dean Blackburn told WUNC last month that three active students and an alum have died of “fentanyl poisoning” in the last two years. The university would not confirm with USA TODAY if Burton was included in that tally. 
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid prescribed for severe pain management. It’s up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. Just 2 milligrams — an amount small enough to fit on the tip of a pencil — can be lethal. 
Because it’s so potent, fentanyl is often added to other drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin, making them cheaper and more dangerous, particularly for teens, college students and other young adults. 
“This scenario is sadly not uncommon, and it can happen to anyone,” said Dr. Ryan Marino, an emergency physician and addiction medicine specialist at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. “This is a reminder of how an unregulated drug supply is always going to be unpredictable and unsafe.”
The best and only way to eliminate the risk of accidental fentanyl exposure is to avoid drugs all together. But Marino says a more realistic piece of advice for those who plan on using them is to "never use alone." 
Here are other important things to know.
No. You cannot see, taste or smell any amount of fentanyl in drugs, the CDC says.
Never assume drugs are safe because you know where or who they came from, experts say; your body could also react differently every time you use drugs.
People can use test strips that detect fentanyl in different drugs like cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, and drug forms, such as pills, powder and injectables, in about five minutes.
It involves dissolving a small amount of a drug in water that you dip a piece of paper in. If the test is positive, throw the drugs out. If it’s negative, be wary because the strips aren't 100% accurate, can’t tell you how much fentanyl is present and can only detect a handful of fentanyl analogs: drugs with similar chemical structures, like the more potent carfentanil.
Still, experts recommend testing drugs anyway. “While they certainly aren’t foolproof, they’re an important tool we have that can reduce harms from an unsafe drug supply,” Marino said. 
Fentanyl test strips are available at your local health department or community organization; they can also be purchased online. Keep in mind, however, that some states consider these tests “criminal drug paraphernalia,” Marino said.
Symptoms of an opioid overdose include:
If you aren’t sure if a person is high or overdosing, the CDC suggests treating it like an overdose to be safe. Here’s what you should do:
Avoid putting a person suspected of overdosing in a cold shower or bath; hitting them to wake them up; or trying to make them vomit, as that can increase their risk of choking. 
And no, you can't overdose on fentanyl just by touching it.
In many cases — no. 
Most states have Good Samaritan laws that protect the person who is overdosing or the person who called 911 from certain criminal penalties.
About a year ago, Kristen Sotakoun casually perused her TikTok. She discovered a woman wanting everyone to guess her age. Sotakoun said: I don't need to guess, because I found it on your social media.
The 33-year-old had 30 followers at the time. Now, she has 1.1 million, and regularly posts about "consensual doxxing."
"It was total accident," Sotakoun says of her newfound hobby-turned-career of lightly stalking people online. The one-time Chicago restaurant server now makes enough money as a TikTok content creator to produce these videos full-time.
People have criticized her for the term she made up. There's nothing "consensual" about doxxing, when you publicly expose someone's personal information (such as a home address or phone number) in order to cause harm. But that's just it: she's facetious. Sotakoun doesn't jump down the rabbit holes of the internet on a quest to find someone's birthday unless they specifically ask (hence the "consensual" part).
Think of her as TikTok's Nancy Drew. "I look at it like a puzzle, and I've always loved puzzles," she says, and also wants to educate people about their online presence. Experts say "consensual doxxing" can be a useful tool for learning about how much information you've put out online about yourself or can simply be a fun activity – but consider it a cautionary tale, too.
"While people on TikTok aren't doing anything malicious with the information, people with intent to harass or harm could pick up doxxing techniques from these videos," says Kimberly Vered Shashoua, licensed clinical social worker. "Unfortunately, these videos highlight an uncomfortable truth: our lives are way more exposed online than we'd like to imagine."
The first TikTok Sotakoun made about "consensual doxxing," only one person commented. After her second video: Hundreds of comments per day. That number has held steady – she picks one or two out of these leads per day to pursue – partially because of the effort she puts into the task.
"It's evolved into people wanting to see the most creative way I found it," she says.
In her first viral video, for example, the subject in question had no videos, his profile picture had a cartoon filter over his face and the only remarkable attribute was that he was wearing glasses. She dug deep through his followers to find a family member, scrolled through her likes on Facebook and found someone else's profile picture where a man was wearing glasses. It correlated with a comment he made on TikTok about being an engineer, and that he lived in Florida, and so on.
"For many people, consensual doxxing is like a treasure hunt," Vered Shashoua says. "While making waves on TikTok, consensual doxxing has been a form of entertainment for awhile, such as in shows like 'Catfish.'"
Sotakoun is not perfect. Sometimes it's impossible to find people's birthdays when their profile is private, they have no followers, they follow no one and/or their username just has the word "user" and a bunch of numbers.
"Obviously, I cannot do anything with that," she says. She estimates she finds 70% to 80% of the people whose birthdays she looks up.
A note about the method to her madness: She doesn't use public records, just social media.
"I want to try to show you that info that you have provided, is the reason that I found your birthday, even though you think you're locked down, your digital footprint is not as good as you think," she says.
Brad Fulton, associate professor of management and social policy at the Indiana University – Bloomington, adds: "It’s important for people to know how much of their personal information can be found online, and consensual doxxing can provide a relatively safe way for someone to discover the extent of their online exposure."
In case you missed:'Dimple maker' trend is taking over TikTok, but could it cause permanent damage?
Sometimes people reach out asking her for tasks beyond birthdays – like to help solve cases. While flattering, she leaves that up to crime-fighting professionals.
"Everybody has the FBI friend of the group. But TikTok has really shown me that hey, I think maybe I'm pretty good at this," she says.
Of course, people may take the wrong lessons away from these videos (i.e. doxxing someone for real). But the positive response has outweighed the negative for Sotakoun.
"I'm hoping that it reaches people who are looking to be more private on the internet," she says. "I'm hoping that the greater good is happening here, and that people will watch my videos and say, 'oh, I need to follow these methods so I can be more protected myself on the internet' as opposed to people using it for more nefarious purposes."

Time to be blunt. James Patterson is less author and more writing machine.
If the onetime ad director turned commercial fiction juggernaut were not decidedly made of flesh and blood, it would be easy to argue that he is actually the humanoid name for ChatGPT, though with much better composition. Send the James Patterson 8000 machine a story idea and, presto, a plot-twisting bestseller emerges.
But the truth of his staggering success – around 200 books and a net worth reported above $800 million – is far simpler. Other than playing early morning golf with his wife Sue, he’d rather be at the laptop hammering out words.
“I came across a quote recently that relates to us all, which is, ‘My time here is short, what can I do most beautifully?’” Patterson says during a conversation with USA TODAY. “For me, that is telling stories. And there are different ways to do that. And I do think I’m a good partner in that pursuit. I don’t bring a big ego to it.”
Collaboration is not a word often associated with writers. Many prefer the solitary if agonizing pursuit of word craft. Or, as the fabled sportswriter Red Smith once described writing: It is merely sitting at a typewriter and opening up a vein.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
But Patterson welcomes the assist. To date, he has co-written books with nearly two dozen people, some fellow pros such as Maxine Paetro and Michael Ledwidge, and others more bold faced names such as former President Bill Clinton and Dolly Parton. And he will soon drop a new book with a “wonderful actor who everyone loves.” He won’t say more. (We're hoping it's Tom Hanks, whose debut novel, “The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece," proved he's as gifted bringing characters to life on the page as he is on the screen.)
For Patterson, the art of collaboration is the natural human state. The idea surfaced first in the mid-‘90s, when he and pal Peter de Jonge finished a round of golf and started talking about a story idea and the next thing they knew, they were writing up “Miracle on the 17th Green.”
“So much good stuff comes from collaboration, most TV shows and movies are all collaboration,” he says. “And if we’re going to save the planet, that’ll take collaboration.”
Patterson’s latest teamwork opus is part one of a planned trilogy with Mike Lupica called “12 Months to Live,” featuring a hard-nosed criminal defense attorney who has that exact life expectancy. The duo is done with “8 Months to Live” and honing in on “4 Months to Live,” writing as fiercely as if they also had the Grim Reaper at their door.
“We have a great writers’ room over the telephone Mike and I, we talk six or seven times a day,” says Patterson. “That’s how we work, and we’ve become best friends along the way.”
Asked how the ideas come, and Patterson relates a story so improbable it can only be true. He said he and Lupica were on a recent book tour in New Jersey and while out for a stroll the weather turned nasty. As they hustled back to shelter, they passed an old man battling the rain on a bicycle.
“I saw the guy, I waved, and a word came out,” he says, not sharing what word. “I went inside and wrote five pages, and that’s going to be our next book together. I’m not sure if that’s a gift or a curse.”
While Patterson’s working relationship with Lupica, a prize-winning sportswriter turned novelist, is on the idyllic side, others don’t work out as well.
Without naming names, Patterson is frank. “Disasters? Yes, in the last two years I’ve had three books where I had to go re-write the whole thing,” he says. “I’m seeing drafts every few weeks and suddenly you see, it’s not happening.”
But most do “happen.” He says his interactions with Clinton (they co-wrote 2018’s “The President Is Missing” and 2021’s “The President’s Daughter”) were smooth, with the Florida-based author shuttling chapters to the former president in New York.
“He’s very smart and a good writer,” says Patterson. “Often a writer is making things up, but in this case, I didn’t have to wonder what the Secret Service would do, I could ask him.” Clinton often would send back chapters with voluminous notes, and the two managed to match their writing styles enough so that the end result was not disjointed.
When it came to working with singing and acting icon Parton (2022’s “Run, Rose, Run”), Patterson again mined his co-author’s real life story to forge a tale of a young singer-songwriter on the rise and on the run from her past.
“For her, it came from the heart,” he says. “But besides that, we have very similar work ethics, although she gets up at 4 a.m. and gets to work, she’s crazy. I gave her an outline, and two days later she had notes and seven songs written. That was the spirit of that thing.”
Generally speaking, Patterson says he comes up with a story synopsis which gets shared with collaborators who then weigh in with their own thoughts and ideas. Then comes a very detailed outline, which is critical to Patterson’s process.
As for the actual writing, it depends on the collaborator. Those with extensive writing chops get less oversight, where newcomers require Patterson to spend more time with the manuscript.
But he’s not complaining. He said he’s been working seven days a week since he was a teen, and finds nothing more satisfying that telling tales, alone or with others. He doesn’t do big cocktails parties, too phony; he prefers the intimacy of a night out chatting with another couple.
There are the morning golf outings with Sue, often embarked upon so early the grounds crew is still on the course. “So we just pick up our balls and walk on,” he says. “We’re back home by 8 a.m.” And then it’s back to the keyboard.
“I don’t have writer’s block, I have writer’s diarrhea,” jokes the man who has published millions of words. “But every time I start something, I am always hoping that the next book is the best thing I’ve ever done.”
Gwyneth Paltrow has been offering lifestyle advice for more than a decade, but don't expect her to escort you into old age. The Oscar-winning actress says she may just disappear from public life when the time comes to sell her lifestyle and health company Goop.
The company, which she founded in 2008, is not for sale right now, however when she does sell it, "I will literally disappear from public life," Paltrow said in a wide-ranging interview in the magazine Bustle.
But can't Paltrow, who is 51, hang around and help show folks how to make it to their 70s and 80s "with grace," asked interviewer Emma Rosenblum, who's also the chief content officer for media company BDG, which publishes Bustle.
"I’ll probably try, knowing myself," Paltrow said. "Or … I might just disappear, and no one will ever see me again."

The Bustle interview is timed to the arrival of Paltrow's new skincare line Good. Clean. Goop., which launches on Amazon and Target on Sunday, Oct. 22.
The lower-priced line of skincare and wellness brands launched under Goop Beauty features "clinically proven beauty products" like moisturizers, exfoliating scrubs, and shampoos, according to a press release.
Paltrow said the decision to sell in Target came after many conversations with the company and her familiarity with the business. And Amazon, too, is a plus because it makes the product even more accessible. "I think of it as us being able to offer something that can be more broadly consumed," Paltrow told Bustle.

When the Bustle interview shifted to her social media habit, Paltrow said she does not keep up with social media. "I end up muting a lot of things. I don't know, I find it hard. I wish I could not be on it, but simultaneously, you want to understand what's happening," said Paltrow. "Then, of course, I need it for work, and they always make me do these stupid things on it."
Paltrow, who won the best actress Oscar in 1999 for her role in "Shakespeare in Love," has also performed well on Instagram where she has 8.3 million followers and, famously, posed in her birthday suit on the site for her birthday in 2020.
Speaking of birthdays, the interviewer then commented on how Paltrow could perhaps make her exit around her 55th birthday, which led to another mention about disappearing. "I'd be happy with that," said Paltrow. "I will disappear from public life. No one will ever see me again."
But she's not quite ready to vamoose just yet, especially because it's her responsibility to keep Goop in the public eye, Paltrow said. "We're not ready to sell yet. I need a few more years."
As for the new Goop offshoot at Amazon and Target, Paltrow told Bustle, "I just hope people really like it and try it."
Spoiler alert! This story includes detailed plot points of the new movie "Killers of the Flower Moon" and the real-life events on which it's based.
The new Martin Scorsese movie “Killers of the Flower Moon” plays like an improbable human horror story, brimming with deceit and death in 1920s Oklahoma.
The 3-hour-and 26-minute film, starring Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone, tells the story of Osage Nation tribal members, newly wealthy from the discovery of oil on their otherwise parched reservation lands, and the duplicitous non-Native Americans who swoop in to steal their bounty.
But while it plays like an allegory, the story is true. Based on the best-selling 2017 book by journalist David Grann, “Killers” is the result of years of research and interviews with Osage elders. The tale explored both the deaths surrounding the family of Mollie Burkhart (Gladstone) as well as the exploits of the nascent Federal Bureau of Investigation.
USA TODAY spoke with Grann to get details on how the movie compares with his book.
“Absolutely,” says Grann. “Because of the vast oil deposits on their lands, by the 1920s the Osage were among the wealthiest people per capita in the world.”
People of the Osage Nation had been moved around by the federal government for years before winding up in a barren stretch of Oklahoma, which wasn’t worth much at the turn of the 20th century. But when oil deposits were discovered, everything changed.
Grann says that in 1923, with roughly 2,000 people on the tribal rolls, the group “collectively got more than $30 million (in payments from oil companies leasing their land),” which translates to about $500 million in today's dollars. And while “few Americans owned a car at that time, many Osage had numerous cars, as well as many servants, often white.”
‘Maybe we’re all capable of this’:Martin Scorsese on ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ movie
Grann says at least 24 Osage tribal members were murdered in order to get their oil rights, so-called “headrights.” A typical way to get these rights was marrying into an Osage family. But as the book and movie explain, sometimes there were shootings or slow poisonings to make the deaths look like mysterious ailments.
While the “Killers” movie focuses on the evil schemes of one man, William Hale (DeNiro), and his hapless nephew Ernest Burkhart (DiCaprio), “the real murders were less about a singular plot or evil figure with henchmen, but rather many killings that were never properly investigated. Many people were complicit: Doctors with their poison, morticians covering up causes of death, lawmen staying silent. Many conclude the real death toll was in the scores, if not hundreds.”
Not likely, says Grann. “There is no evidence that I know of that Mollie spoke to the president about the murders,” he says. “But it needs to be underscored that the Osage did go to Washington, D.C., and she might have been on a trip.”
Grann says Burkhart, as the movie shows, was so distraught by the deaths of her sisters that she “vigorously campaigned for justice, offering testimony when needed and hiring private detectives to help find the killers.”
In 1921, a young J. Edgar Hoover, who would wind up as the notorious and longstanding director of the FBI, took over a new office then simply called the Bureau of Investigation. Hoover was eager to put his new group on the political map, so he eagerly dispatched a former Texas Ranger, Tom White (Jesse Plemons) to Oklahoma to investigate the mysterious Osage murders after local law enforcement hadn't solved the case.
“This was among the first big complex homicide investigations by the fledgling Bureau of Investigation, which would become the FBI,” says Grann. “At the time, this office had limited jurisdiction over crimes nationally, but it did have jurisdiction over crimes on federal (Native American) lands.”
Grann adds that thanks in part to this case, laws were passed in the 1930s that gave the FBI greater reach.
“There was something unquestionably evil about Hale, at his core,” says Grann. “According to the records he did show no remorse. He had created and was reflective of a pathological ideology of western expansionism, a boosterism and a conviction' that the Native American way of life was ending. world was going.”
Hale served his time and died at 87 in Arizona in 1962.
Our critic says:In 'Killers of the Flower Moon,' Martin Scorsese crafts a gripping story of love, murder
At the end of Scorsese’s “Killers,” the director makes a cameo appearance as an actor in a Lucky Strike cigarette-sponsored radio play about the Osage murders, years after the case was closed..
Grann says the story was the subject of a radio play, but its purpose was less about sharing outrage of the treatment of Native Americans as glorifying the FBI's work.
“Hoover wanted it to burnish his and the Bureau’s reputation, so he organized these propagandistic retellings of what happened,” says Grann. “The scene in the movie is getting at the issue of how history is recorded, and often misrecorded. Sure, Hoover closed the case, but there was a deep conspiracy surrounding the murders that the Bureau never exposed.”
Toby Keith is back in the driver's seat amid his battle with stomach cancer, and he's ready to perform for fans again.
The 62-year-old country star announced Friday that he will be headlining two Las Vegas shows in December to "get the band back in sync (and) get me rolling again," Keith said in a video posted to Instagram.
The concerts will take place on Dec. 10 and 11 at Dolby Live Park MGM Las Vegas. Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. on Oct. 27 and will be available at ticketmaster.com.
These will be what he called "rehab" shows that allow Keith to get reacquainted with performing. After being diagnosed with stomach cancer in fall 2021, the performer has taken a two-year break from music. He's done several public appearances recently, including at two pop-up concerts in Oklahoma and the People’s Choice Country Awards in Nashville.
In his video announcing the upcoming shows, Keith hinted at how his cancer treatments are going.
"I've been on the old rollercoaster. But Almighty's riding shotgun; he's letting me drive for some reason," he said in his Instagram video. "I was going to sit around here and do nothing like I have been. Or (I can) get up, go outside. Don't let the old man in, you know what I mean?"
He added, "(This is the) first time in my whole life I've been off over two years. I've never been off a year in my life. And through COVID and cancer, old devil's been at me a little bit.
"I've got him by the horns right now, so instead of just sitting around and waiting, we're going to get the band back together," he said.
Last month, Keith was honored with the 2023 Country Icon Award at the People’s Choice Country Awards. During his first televised performance since sharing his cancer diagnosis in June 2022, he performed "Don't Let the Old Man," his song from Clint Eastwood's 2018 film, "The Mule."
"I feel pretty good," Keith told E! News at the Nashville awards show. "It's a little bit of a roller coaster. You get good days and, you know, you're up and down."
He added, "It's always zero to 60 and 60 to zero, but I feel good today."
'I feel pretty good':Toby Keith shares update on cancer battle at People's Choice Country Awards
The best advice you can give a college coach is to change jobs every seven or eight years, if they’re lucky enough to make it that long. It doesn’t apply in every case, of course. There’s a separate category for coaches who win national championships, though they aren’t necessarily immune either. Coaches who regularly punch above their weight at programs that don't expect titles might have it best of all in this business because they can usually stay as long as they want. 
But if you're at a top-shelf place and you’re good but constantly falling short of the ultimate goal in the same way over and over again, you’re always on a timer. Even if the school doesn’t really want to fire you, the fans eventually tire of you. And even with all the money being deposited in your bank account, it’s not the best quality of life. 
Meet James Franklin, the coach at Penn State. He’s had some good stretches. He’s had a few down periods. But mainly, he’s just kind of achieved at the same level for 10 years. And that level isn’t Ohio State or Michigan's level, which means the Nittany Lions have been cut out of the College Football Playoff picture because of two teams they play every year. 
Is that good enough? Penn State needs to beat those teams now and then. And Saturday seemed like a good chance, with Ohio State somewhat diminished from the offensive monster they were the last few years and Penn State sporting the best defense it’s had under Franklin. This year might have been as even as the overall talent has ever been. 
And for all that, Franklin’s team didn’t even really show up. Yeah, they were in the game into the fourth quarter. But they didn’t play well at all offensively, gaining just 240 yards with 49 rushing yards on 26 attempts.
In the end, it was a 20-12 loss with a garbage time touchdown making it look more respectable, dropping Franklin to 1-9 against Ohio State. He’s fared better against Michigan (3-6), but the Wolverines weren’t a top-10 team in those three good years.

BIG BUCKS: Brian Kelly earns $500,000 bowl bonus for LSU's sixth win
In other words, the overall picture is more or less the same for Penn State as it was six or seven years ago once Franklin got the program rolling. Whether they’re right or wrong, how long until the people at Penn State just want something … different? 
The romance in college football is often in the hope and the unknown, but that’s gone at Penn State. They know what the program is and isn’t under Franklin. At this point, fans could probably predict almost word-for-word what he’s going to say at his press conference. 
And it’s all really good. But as Saturday’s performance showed, still not good enough. 
For that reason, Penn State is No. 1 in this week’s Misery Index, a weekly measurement of which fan bases are feeling the most angst about the state of their favorite program. 
In the euphoria of Sam Pittman getting the Razorbacks to 9-4 in 2021, the athletics director at Arkansas did what ADs usually do in these situations. He got hoodwinked by super agent Jimmy Sexton into giving out a big contract extension, even though Pittman was neither leaving nor being seriously pursued by anyone else. That AD’s name is Hunter Yurachek, and these days you mostly hear about him because he’s been one of the loudest voices begging for a national law regulating name, image and likeness and arguing that schools will go broke or have to cut sports if players become employees and get paid. 
But when Yurachek has to fire his football coach -- which might be this year -- you won't hear him cry poor or threaten to pull money from women’s volleyball or men’s golf. He’ll just go find the money because that’s what these ADs do. And it’ll be a lot of money — either $16.1 million or $10.7 million, which is an interesting story on its own.
The contract stipulated that Pittman got an extra year if he won seven games at any point in the deal, which was accomplished last season when the Razorbacks went 7-6. But if his overall record dipped from the beginning of 2021 dipped below .500 it would be a smaller buyout.
After a 7-3 loss to Mississippi State — Arkansas’ sixth in a row and 10th in its last 12 SEC games — Pittman’s record since 2021 is 18-16. If the Hogs lose their next two to Florida and Auburn, he’ll be right at .500 heading into a Nov. 18 game against…Florida International. 
It’s all funny money these days in college football, but the idea that a game against FIU could be worth $5.4 million to Pittman personally and to Arkansas’ budget is maybe the only funny thing about this disaster of a Razorbacks season. 
One of many schools that got tricked into thinking they really had something going during the bizarro pandemic season of 2020, the Hoosiers rewarded coach Tom Allen with a way-too-friendly contract in March of 2021. Now, 2 1/2 seasons and a measly eight total wins later, Indiana would be on the hook for a $20 million buyout if they want to get rid of him. 
And they probably need to after dropping to 2-5 overall and 0-4 in the Big Ten with a 31-14 loss to Rutgers. 
Hey, Indiana fans had reason to be excited back then. Indiana wasn’t a one-hit COVID wonder, but it was a two-hit wonder under Allen. In 2019, when the Hoosiers went 8-5, their offensive coordinator was Kalen DeBoer, who has worked wonders at Fresno State and now Washington. Their defensive coordinator was Kane Wommack, an up-and-comer who is winning big at South Alabama. By 2021, both were gone — as is quarterback Michael Penix who tore it up in 2020, suffered from multiple injuries and ultimately followed DeBoer to the Huskies, where he is now the Heisman Trophy favorite.
So while Allen obviously had something to do with the success, he totally owns the failure that has followed. Indiana is a football program used to going back to square one every few years. It seems they're about to find themselves back in the same spot. 
Here’s the state of things currently in East Lansing. On the night they lost at home 49-0 to their most hated rival with an interim coach who is in place because their old coach admitted to masturbating on the phone with a university vendor who subsequently filed a sexual harassment complaint, somehow the only thing anyone will remember about this game is Adolf Hitler. We shouldn’t have to explain why it’s bad to have an image of a smiling Hitler on your scoreboard as part of your pre-game entertainment, regardless of context. (It was a trivia question that the university apologized for and blamed on poor oversight of a third-party vendor.) But how did that one slip past the game operations people? Or, as soon as somebody saw anything involving Hitler on the scoreboard, how did someone not just reach as quickly as possible for the button to turn it off? But however it happened, unspeakable embarrassment keeps coming for the Spartans. 
It’s very hard to get to the national championship game. It’s almost as hard to throw away most of that goodwill with the fan base in a matter of 10 months. But that’s about where the Horned Frogs find themselves after a 41-3 loss at Kansas State. At 4-4 with trips to Texas Tech and Oklahoma still on the schedule along with home games against Texas and Baylor, it will be a high-wire act for Sonny Dykes to get this very mediocre team to 6-6. TCU was obviously an excellent team last year with Max Duggan at quarterback, but also had a lot of good bounces go its way. If a Duggan-less TCU follows that up with a losing record, that run might be remembered as a bit of a historical fluke. 
Somehow, despite being a dog-tired football team, the Knights managed to score on a fourth-and-10 with 1:16 remaining to pull within a two-point conversion of tying Oklahoma in Norman. And then what did they do? They tried a terrible, double-pass trick play that required the ball to go seven yards behind the line of scrimmage before a right-handed receiver rolled left. Meanwhile, UCF had nobody on the right side of the field to draw the defense. Oklahoma sniffed it out easily and the second pass was actually never attempted. Welcome to the Gus Malzahn experience, UCF fans. And remarkably, it dropped UCF to 0-for-3 on two-point conversions this year — all on plays with some level of trickery. For a team that's third in the country in rushing this year, that's not just bizarre, it’s almost inexcusable. But for the 3-4 Knights, that’s kind of what you get sometimes with the Gus Bus.
Shane Beamer had an unexpectedly fun first two years with the Gamecocks. But he’s getting a reputation as the saltiest loser in the sport, which has already gotten old during a spiraling 2-5 season. After the season opener against North Carolina, he complained about the chain gang delaying an onside kick attempt to start the second half. Last week after blowing a 10-point lead to Florida, he kicked a Gatorate cooler and broke a bone in his foot. And even after Saturday's 34-12 loss at Missouri, he made a snide comment about the press conference room being sub-standard compared to the school's nice new facilities. Is this stuff a huge deal? No. And Beamer is a nice guy, but he spends a lot of time apologizing for stuff he does in the heat of the moment.
Welcome to the big time, Bearkats. And no, we don't mean Conference USA. We mean the Misery Index, and it’s well-deserved. After many years as one of the top Championship Subdivision programs with a national title just three seasons ago, you for some reason decided to leave that comfort zone and jump on the FBS train. And after a 33-27 double-overtime loss to Florida International, you now know how hard it's going to be. Sam Houston State is now 0-7 since moving up, and in an era of NIL, possible player compensation and a widening gap between the haves and have-nots, how much upside was there really for you to make this move? 
The trajectory seemed clear, from complete despair to signs of life to winning records in 2021 and 2022. But suddenly, the Pirates are back in the bad place — maybe a worse place. They’re 1-6 after a 10-7 home loss to Charlotte, which had also been struggling at 1-5 coming into the game, and the numbers are all very ugly. A bottom-10 offense nationally  coming in, the Pirates managed 127 yards against Charlotte and missed a tying 48-yard field goal with 34 seconds left. With such a passionate fan base and a highly regarded coach in Mike Houston, who won big at the lower levels including a national FCS title at James Madison, it's all very hard to figure. 
PHOENIX — It was like a professional sumo wrestler strolling into an all-you-can-eat Brazilian steak house and ordering a salad.
It was like seeing a Ferrari going 50 mph on the Autobahn.
It was spending the evening with Kevin Hart without cracking a smile.
It was the powerful Philadelphia Phillies stunning everyone in the house Saturday night at Chase Field with a sneak attack that even had their own players scratching their head.
“I couldn’t believe it,’’ Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto said. “I was shocked.’’
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
The Phillies dismantled the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-1, taking a 3-2 lead in the National League Championship Series. The D-backs are still trying to figure out what hit them.
Sure, the Phillies still showed off their muscle, hitting three home runs, two within seven pitches for a total of 905 feet.
Zack Wheeler again showed why he was one of the best free-agent signings in all of baseball, impersonating Roy Halladay in a dominant performance when the Phillies bullpen was in shambles.
Still, the play that left everyone gasping for air occurred right out of the gate in the first inning, completely changing the complexion of the NLCS.
It began with Kyle Schwarber, who led off the game with a 45-foot dribbler for a base hit. He couldn’t stop laughing as he ran to first. Bryce Harper followed with a single one batter later, and with two outs, Schwarber scored on Bryson Stott’s two-out single. Schwarber, who hit a 461-foot homer in the sixth inning, had barely even touched third base when right fielder Corbin Carroll fielded the ball, but he gambled by running home, and scored easily.
It set up the play of the night, if not the series.
Realmuto, at the plate, watched Stott take off from first base trying to steal second, quickly turned to his left, and saw Harper charging towards the plate.
They were attempting a rare double steal.
“From the start of the playoffs, sort of the message to everybody was, 'Let's put pressure on people,'" Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. “That doesn't mean the double steals. It also means getting down the line, putting pressure on people with ground balls, putting pressure on the outfield … forcing them to maybe make some mistakes.’’
The execution was perfect. Diamondbacks catcher Gabriel Moreno got the pitch from Zac Gallen, stood up and fired to second base, but Stott stopped. D-backs second baseman Ketel Marte grabbed the ball and fired home, but it bounced in front of Moreno. Harper crashed into Moreno's left shoulder, and scored.
And just like that, the Phillies had their first steal of home in a postseason game in franchise history.
The Phillies, without hitting a home run or even producing an extra-base hit, had a 2-0 lead, and Harper became the oldest player to steal home in a postseason game since the great Jackie Robinson. Sure, it wasn’t a straight steal of home like Robinson’s in Game 1 of the 1955 World Series, but it counted just the same.
“We're going to be aggressive right here,’’ said Harper, who would later hit a 441-foot homer in the sixth inning. “Bryson had the green light. He went, and i just tried to make the best decision to get there and make it happen to score that run...
“You know, baseball play. Big collision at the plate. But just a good position to put us in.’’
It was just what the Phillies needed after watching their bullpen blow the last two games. They have their swagger back just in time for a trip to Citizens Bank Park where they have the biggest home-field advantage in baseball.
“It was a risky play because they have a really good catcher and really good infielders that make that play probably seven out of 10 times at least,’’ Realmuto said. “We just got lucky they didn’t make a good throw back to the plate.
“But what they did to us the last two games, coming back, they had all of the momentum in the world, and we had to try to do something early in the game to get it back.’’
The double steal, called by third base coach Dusty Wathan, gave Stott the option of trying to steal second. If he went, Harper was instructed to take off. If Moreno doesn’t throw down, the Phillies have two runners in scoring position. If Stott is thrown out, the worst that happens is that Realmuto leads off the next inning.
Yet, it was executed to perfection.
“If Bryce doesn’t run right when he’s supposed to,’’ Stott said, “he’s thrown out. Last year, I ran the same play (against the Mets), and I was thrown out by 10 feet. It’s a big-time play.
“There’s a lot of stuff that has to go right so it’s tough on the defense. He’s got to make a good throw to second, a good throw back to home, he’s got to tag him. He ran it perfect for us.’’
It turned out the Diamondbacks didn’t make one good throw, and you better believe that when they take the field to work out Sunday at Citizens Bank Park, defending the double steal will be on the agenda.
“We work on that a lot,’’ D-backs manager Torey Lovullo says. “I think if we just play pitch and catch, and he drives the throw into home plate and gives Gaby a chance to catch that ball, and lay the tag down on Harper, he is out by eight, 10 feet.
“The play didn't surprise us. We were anticipating it. It was well-timed by our guys. We just didn't finish the play.’’
Whether the D-backs were caught off guard or not, the double steal immediately gave the Phillies momentum, allowed them to forget the nightmare of the last two nights, and put all of the pressure on the D-backs.
“That was massive,’’ said Schwarber, who now has 20 postseason home runs in 63 postseason games, tied for fourth all-time with Hall of Famer Derek Jeter. “You can’t understate how big it was to be able to score first to get those runs across, and let Wheeler do his thing.’’
And, oh, did Wheeler come through at a time the Phillies desperately needed it.
“You can't say enough about him,’’ Harper said. “I told him after the game, like, 'You're one of the best pitchers I've ever played with, man.' I've played with a lot of good ones, and he's easily top three.
“It's incredible what he does. It's so much fun to watch. I love playing behind him. It’s incredible. He's legit, man.’’
Certainly, the timing was impeccable. The Phillies’ bullpen was exhausted, using 11 relievers in the last two games to combine for 26 outs. Wheeler came out and absolutely dominated. He pitched seven innings, giving up six hits while striking out eight, leaving with a 6-1 lead.
“You're definitely thinking about it coming into the game,’’ Wheeler said. “I know the bullpen was taxed a little bit, so I needed to go deep, and obviously I wanted that to be quality innings. So, I was able to do that, and save the bullpen a little bit.’’
He might have also saved their season with the Phillies now going home, where they have the greatest postseason winning percentage in baseball history, just one game from a return trip to the World Series — and perhaps a rematch against the defending champion Astros.
If it happens, it would be the first World Series rematch since 1977-1978, when the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees met.
“If we were to make it there, and they make it there,’’ Wheeler said, “it'd be pretty cool. It's really hard to do, making it to the World Series, so two teams to make it there back-to-back would be pretty awesome.’’

HOUSTON – This little Lone Star State intramural took a turn for the spicy. And it’s up to the Texas Rangers to ensure the American League Championship Series continues beyond Sunday night.
The intensity of Game 5 was, fortunately for both teams, followed by an off day Saturday before the Rangers and Houston Astros resume pleasantries (hostilities?) Sunday. For the first time this year, the Rangers face a must-win situation: A victory would force a Game 7 on Monday night at Minute Maid Park, not the worst proposition given that the road team has won every game in this season.
With accomplished playoff starters Framber Valdez and Nathan Eovaldi set for their second matchup this series, USA TODAY Sports breaks down Game 6, which could end with champagne showers and a third straight World Series trip for the Astros:
The fallout from a stunning Game 5, capped by Jose Altuve’s go-ahead ninth-inning three-run homer but almost equally remembered for a benches-clearing incident an inning earlier, will linger over this series.
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
Saturday, Major League Baseball suspended Astros reliever Bryan Abreu two games for what it and the umpiring crew deemed an intentional hit-by-pitch. That the Astros would choose to “send a message” to Rangers slugger Adolis Garcia for his bat slam, home-run saunter and a previous conflict from July seems remote, but not impossible.
Still, the Astros were justified in their anger that Abreu was ejected with no warning, and with a huge impact at a crucial juncture in Game 5. Abreu can appeal and play in Game 6 but would roll the dice that an upheld suspension could affect his World Series eligibility.
The Astros were split on whether Garcia’s aggressive actions toward catcher Martin Maldonado helped spur their comeback. At the least, it seemed they kept their heads just a bit better than the Rangers.
The playoffs aren’t the place to settle scores, especially with the umpiring crew on high alert from the get-go. Yet the Rangers facing an elimination game and the Game 5 aftermath will make the tension more palpable.
“Man, I don't know. I don't have no crystal ball,” says Astros manager Dusty Baker, who also was ejected from Game 5. “I mean, it's going to be what it's going to be. You have to wait and see, just like me.
“Like we don't script it, it just happens.”
The regular season did not go fully to plan for Valdez and Eovaldi, the left-hander battling inconsistency and the Rangers right-hander earning an All-Star berth but then missed six weeks with a forearm strain.
Both can certainly take comfort in their playoff resumes.
Eovaldi has a 2.87 playoff ERA and has won seven games, including one win in each playoff round so far. He was fabulous in the Game 2 matchup against Houston, pitching out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the fifth. Eovaldi gave up homers to Yordan Alvarez and Alex Bregman, but they came with the bases empty.
“You've got to make sure that they earn it all, says Eovaldi. “And ultimately they're going to end up beating you with the home runs. If you can leave it to singles, you have a better chance of getting that double play ball and getting out of those situations.”
Valdez took a huge step forward in October 2022, when the Astros won all four of his starts, including a six-inning, nine-strikeout effort in World Series Game 6, when the Astros clinched the title.
He was his own worst enemy in Game 2, making two errors on one play while getting peppered by five singles in the first inning. Still, Valdez will lean on the experience of his 14 postseason starts.
“It is a lot,” Valdez says through a translator. “And it just helps with all repetitions, just being able to go through it and having done it in the past.
“This is not my first or second postseason, so that just helps me stay calm, and God willing with the hard work with the guys and myself, hopefully we'll be able to get the win tomorrow.”
It’s hard to ignore the numbers: All-Star middle infielders Corey Seager and Marcus Semien are batting a combined .186 (8-for-43) this series. Semien is still looking for his first extra-base hit.
“They’re critical to our offense, there’s no getting around it,” says manager Bruce Bochy.
Semien famously takes pride in playing every game – Game 6 will be his 172nd of the year – and says he will continue to grind in the batting cage, aiming to decipher how the Astros are beating him at the plate.
“The adjustments I’ve made are all about getting in the cage, understanding what I’m doing, and hitting the ball hard,” says Semien. “A day off in the playoffs is still a work day.”
Semien did scorch the ball in his last at-bat, but right at Astros reserve shortstop Grae Kessinger as the Rangers’ ninth-inning rally fizzled at the top of the order.
The Astros also got a positive reinforcement from their slumping star: Kyle Tucker smacked a double off lefty reliever Aroldis Chapman in Game 5, a key hit that ultimately forced the Rangers to insert closer Jose Leclerc in the eighth inning; he gave up Altuve’s game-winning homer an inning later.
Tucker is batting just .108 (5 for 32) this postseason and has been dropped to sixth in the lineup. He did  reach base four times (three of them walks) in Game 3.
“We need to get him going in order for me to move him back up,” says Baker. “And pretty soon I think he'll be ready.”
Not only has the road team won every game this series, but the home team did not even take a lead until the sixth inning of Game 5. The Astros are loathe to entertain the fact this ALCS mirrors their 2019 World Series, when they erased a 2-0 deficit by winning all three games at Washington – only to go 0-4 and lose the series to the Nationals.
Perhaps the Minute Maid Park faithful will be more aroused Sunday night after the Game 5 tensions.
PHILADELPHIA — Former Miami Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria had no idea. It was complete news to him. The word hadn’t spread to Paris, apparently. 
Just three years after being lauded as an industry leader for hiring Kim Ng as the first female general manager in baseball history, the Marlins unceremoniously dumped her two weeks after earning their first postseason berth in a full season. 
Oh, technically Ng departed on her own, refusing to accept a demotion with the planned hiring of a head of baseball operations while accepting a one-year mutual option, but it was a rude way of telling her that they didn’t believe in her. Who knows, maybe they never really wanted to hire her in the first place. 
And now, they have gotten rid of Ng and the man responsible for hiring her, Hall of Famer Derek Jeter. 
“She did the right thing leaving, she did a wonderful job," Loria told USA TODAY Sports after being informed of the move. "There may have been some other people pulling strings there, but it’s not a nice way to reward somebody that got you to the playoffs."
FOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team
How about Jeter, who resigned with a year left on his five-year, $25 million contract? 
“Let me just say it’s a long way to go from shortstop to CEO and head of baseball operations," Loria said. “I couldn’t believe Jeter fired everybody, even the great talent evaluators. How could he let Andre Dawson and Tony Perez go? I shake my head at some of the things that happened."
This is the 20-year anniversary of the Marlins’ stunning World Series championship, bringing a 72-year-old out of retirement (Jack McKeon) to manage in mid-season, calling up a 20-year-old third baseman (Miguel Cabrera) from Class AA to learn a new position in the major leagues, inadvertently making a household name out of a Chicago Cubs fan (Steve Bartman), knocking off the mighty New York Yankees with an unconventional pitching decision, and introducing a gaudy World Series ring that is now the standard for all sports teams. 
“Twenty years has flown by," said Loria, who wrote a 432-page memoir, “From The Front Row: Reflections of a Major League Baseball Owner and Modern Art Dealer. “It went quickly. When you get to my age (82), every year goes quickly."
Loria, who sold the Marlins for $1.2 billion in 2017 after purchasing the franchise for $158.5 million, watches plenty of games on his iPhone, but doesn’t miss it after being an owner for 17 years with the Montreal Expos and Marlins.
He cringes about what is happening in Miami. He believes that Jeter ruined the ballpark by removing their home run sculpture behind the center-field fence. He wonders what owner Bruce Sherman is doing after firing so many of his employees, and now forcing Ng out. And he worries whether the franchise will ever be successful. 
“I wished them good luck when I left," Loria says, "but I don’t know if they should be doing what they’re doing, whatever that is."
The Marlins created shock waves in the industry when they parted company with Ng, leaking that their reasoning was they were upset with their drafts and farm development under her watch. They then turned around and fired several other employees, including amateur scouting director D.J. Svihlik, who has been with the organization since 2017. 
So much for the good vibes of a 20-year reunion.
Really, it all started when Loria, on the advice of traveling secretary Bill Beck, hired McKeon, who had been out of baseball for three years. The Marlins were 16-22, Loria wanted to fire Jeff Torborg, and Loria listened to Beck telling him that he should interview McKeon. 
“So I called him, told me to meet on Collins Avenue, and there is an older gentleman sitting there with a plaid shirt and different plaid pants," Loria says. “I said, 'Jack?' He said, 'Jerry?’ 
"And that’s how our beautiful relationship started."
McKeon led the Marlins to a wild-card berth back at a time where there was only one wild card team, beat the San Francisco Giants in the NL Division Series, shocked the Cubs after trailing 3 games to 1, and then turned the baseball world upside down by beating the Yankees with a payroll three times the size of Miami. 
“It’s something I’ll cherish forever," Loria says. “I can still see almost every play, every innings, all of the excitement in Chicago to hearing Pudge Rodriguez say, 'We’re going to win this one for you, Jack.'"
It was Rodriguez, the Hall of Fame catcher, along with several players, who asked Loria during their playoff run whether their potential World Series rings would have white or yellow yellow diamonds. 
“Just win the [expletive] World Series,’’ Loria said, “and you’ll see." 
What they didn’t realize was that Loria, the art dealer, would design a ring that would forever change sports. The ring weighed a stunning 100.6 grams with the gem weight of 4.75 carats, including 228 white diamonds. 
It wasn’t so much a ring, but a portable trophy. 
“I was the art dealer trying to create something great," Loria said. “I wanted it to be special, I wanted it to be sculptural. I said, 'Boys, you’re going to get the biggest, greatest thing you ever saw, but just win the damn World Series.'
“Now, as you notice, it changed championship rings, with that tremendous, big style, in all of sports.’’ 
It never would have been possible, Loria says, if not for the hiring of McKeon and the call-up of 20-year-old Cabrera. He was playing at Class AA, strictly as a third baseman, and the Marlins needed an outfielder. Loria suggested Cabrera, which was shot down by GM Larry Beinfest. 
“I told him he had no choice, Cabrera came up, hit a walk-off homer in the 10th inning, and that was the start of his Hall of Fame career." 
It was in the World Series against the Yankees that Loria decided to exercise his authority again. He was on the bench during batting practice before Game 1, and noticed that the Marlins were awestruck by Yankee Stadium, a fear that they didn’t belong. 
Loria turned to McKeon and said, “I think we have a problem. They’re playing Frank Sinatra’s 'New York, New York.’ My players are coming in from center field where they were in Monument Park, looking over at the Yankee dugout, and looked totally intimidated. Some of these players had never even been to New York." 
So, Loria asked McKeon if he could address the team. 
McKeon’s response: “It’s your [expletive] team, Jeffrey. You’re the owner. You can do what you want.’’ 
Loria walked into the clubhouse carrying a baseball bat, picked up the bat, and smashed it on the table. 
“Look, you’ve got the best record in baseball the second half of the season," Loria shouted. “You’ve got a leader in your manager. If you believe in him and yourself, you will the Series. 
“Oh, and just to let know, all of those players’ names you saw in Monument Park are dead." 
Loria interjected himself one more time before the Series was over after McKeon decided to start ace Josh Beckett on short rest. It was a huge risk. McKeon could have waited until Game 7 with Beckett on regular rest, but the way McKeon figured it, they had no chance winning a Game 7 at Yankee Stadium. 
Loria, knowing that Beckett, 23, would be nervous, telephoned him in his hotel room the morning of the game. 
“I said, “Josh, you’ve got the worst taste of clothes on the team,'" Loria recalled. “I said, ‘Why don’t you come with me. We’ll go to Barneys, get you some new shirts.’ Really, I was just trying to distract him. 
“Well, I walk into the stadium late that afternoon, he was just in front of the clubhouse TV, watching cartoons. I knew then that nobody would stop him."
Beckett threw a five-hit, complete-game shutout, beating the Yankees, 2-0, and walked away with the World Series MVP award.
Highlights of the Marlins’ championship will be shown often during this year’s World Series. They’ll show Cabrera being knocked down by Roger Clemens, staring him down, and then hitting a home run. They’ll show Beckett’s brilliant performance. 
And they’ll surely show McKeon, chomping on his cigar, leading the Marlins to one of the most unlikely World Series championships in history. 
“Jack is my hero," Loria said. “I mean it. Not only does he belong in the Hall of Fame, but he belongs to go in on a gold chair. You look at what he’s done for the game, his role as a GM and manager, winning a World Series, how does he not belong?"
If Loria was still owner, McKeon, 92, would have managed the Marlins for at least a game after he turned 88, making him the oldest manager in history, surpassing Connie Mack. 
Then again, if Loria was still owner, he’d be vehemently against putting an expansion franchise in Montreal (“they don’t deserve one"), strongly considering one in Indianapolis (“right in the middle of the country"), and do everything possible to make sure the Tampa Bay Rays get their new ballpark for owner Stu Sternberg (“a wonderful, brilliant man"). 
“It doesn’t matter what I think anymore," Loria said. “I had my time. It was wonderful. I still love the game. I miss the game. I miss the camaraderie. I cheer for the Dodgers because of [president] Stan Kasten. I cheer for the Mets. Stevie Cohen is a friend of mine. 
“But to be a baseball owner again? No, thank you. I’ve had enough. I’ve got the memories, and no one can ever take that away."
Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez is imploring Dominican Republic officials and Major League Baseball to increase their security to stop the rage of armed robberies at baseball’s academies in the Dominican Republic. 
There have already been four MLB facilities – St. Louis Cardinals, Miami Marlins, Cleveland Guardians and Detroit Tigers_who have been victimized by armed robberies. The Dominican Republic police is searching for men who have entered the complexes with gun to steal cash, jewelry, cell phones and baseball equipment. 
“This has become really dangerous," Martinez told USA TODAY Sports. “It’s become alarming and concerning, not to just MLB, but all of us. We send our kids to these academies, feel like they’re protected, and things are happening. 
“I don’t know what is happening, or what is leading to this, but it needs to be stopped by the authorities in the Dominican Republic quickly so it does not escalate. MLB needs to also get involved to give more protection for these kids and those who work in the academies." 
Martinez is the centerpiece of TBS’ alternative stream featuring cultural conversations through the experiences of top former and current Latino players throughout the ALCS, called ALTcast: Peloteros. It has featured players such as Albert Pujos, Yonder Alonso, Enrique Hernandez and Nestor Cortes. 
“We appreciate the opportunity to be handed the platform,’’ Martinez said, “to share our knowledge and experiences of the big leagues. We love baseball 24/7, and want to pass the baton. We want the next generation of players to be as good as we were, and be more prepared. It’s more challenging now with social media. Every phone is a camera, every phone is a microphone, and you can be all over the world in seconds. That can be challenging. 
“So I want to be the daddy for every young player out there. You don’t have to be Latino, I just want to be around them, make sure they’re ok, like a father figure, and offer some sort of advice and information to help their careers."
This is why Martinez believes it’s so important for security to be beefed up at these facilities to assure that no one gets hurt, greatly damaging the sport in a country that lives and breathes baseball. 
“This never used to happen when I was back in the academy in the Dominican with the Dodgers," Martinez said. “We didn’t come from anything. There was not one player who was middle or upper class. But because we played baseball, we were spoiled. We were treated like royalty. We were untouchable. 
“We came from the same areas, the same ghettos as the people that are robbing these players. No one touched us. I don’t know what’s going on, but it needs to be addressed." 
Martinez wants other Latin star voices to be heard in these telecasts. He wants to let them know the difficulties of growing up impoverished in the Dominican, and suddenly thrust into professional baseball without knowing a word of English, and expected to act like you were born and raised in the United States. 
Craig Barry, the executive vice president and chief content officer of Turner Sports, thought it was important to have Martinez and Latin baseball stars to share their experiences during the NLCS. It’s the baseball version of ESPN's popular Manningcast.
“Our mandate was to be authentic and honest, and have a representation of the culture," Barry said. “Everybody has really enjoyed the experience, not just the traditional broadcast approach." 
It’s possible the alternate broadcast becomes a staple for TBS regular season games, and, yes, there's an open invitation out to NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, the most popular broadcaster in all of sports. 
One day, Pedro and Charles together, can you imagine? 
“I’m a free spirit, and I just love getting out of the box," Martinez says. “I love to let everyone know how I feel, how I would respond to situations, our passion,, and how we perceive the game. 
“To me, it’s like I’m watching a game with a couple of buddies on the sofa and expressing my emotions."
– The Houston Astros plan to do everything possible to lock up All-Star second baseman Jose Altuve to a contract extension to keep him in the organization for the duration of his career. 
Altuve and third baseman Alex Bregman each are eligible for free agency after the 2024 season, but the Astros privately say their focus is squarely on Altuve. Altuve, who has been with the organization since 2007, will be paid $26 million in the final year of his seven-year, $163.5 million extension. 
– In an era when managers have had the least power and autonomy in baseball history, there is Alex Cora of the Boston Red Sox, who yields the most power of any manager in the game. He is part of the interview process for the Red Sox’s vacant baseball operations position, with Craig Breslow of the Chicago Cubs (a Theo Epstein protégé) and Thad Levine of the Minnesota Twins considered the co-favorites. 
– Will Venable, the Texas Rangers’ associate manager, is in no hurry to leave Texas. He has declined interview requests for the Cleveland Guardians and New York Mets’ managerial vacancies.
– It’s difficult to find any baseball executives who still believe that San Diego Padres manager Bob Melvin and GM A.J. Preller will be working together by opening day. 
There still is tension bubbling beneath the surface. 
– The Padres are considering shifting shortstop Xander Bogaerts, who they signed to an 11-year, $280 million contract last winter, to second base or first in 2024, clearing a spot for Ha-Seong Kim. Bogaerts has played shortstop exclusively since 2014 and has never played second base or first base. 
– Hard to believe there has not been a former Mets manager who has gotten another managerial job since Bobby Valentine, who was fired after the 2002 season. 
Buck Showalter is trying to break that streak. 
– The Cardinals are speaking to future Hall of Fame catcher Yadier Molina about a potential major-league coaching job, but it appears to be a longshot. 
– There’s no current player who has a better shot of going straight from the field to the manager’s chair than Astros catcher Martin Maldonado once he retires. 
– Phillies starter Zack Wheeler joins the chorus of baseball veterans who believe that teams are doing a disservice to young starters by not letting them pitch longer in games, and getting out of their own jams. 
“Coming up as a top prospect, I was babied a little bit and that’s, I guess, normal,” Wheeler said. “I guess if I was drafting somebody who I thought had potential and a really good arm, I would probably do the same thing. But at the same time, I think maybe today they're holding back a little bit too much. … 
“You need a starter who can go five, six, seven innings, at least a couple that can go deeper. Just throughout the season, those one or two innings more than other starters sometimes add up over the season. But it’s not my call. I don't make that investment, so I can’t tell you how to do it. 
“But just from being a starter and running through that process, I would like to see the leash unraveled a little bit more. You have to pitch in tough situations. You have to pitch fatigued.” 
– Fabulous Hall of Fame Era Committee ballot: 
Managers

Piniella, Leyland and West are considered the early favorites to land in Cooperstown. 
The inductees will be announced Dec. 3. 
– The Giants are putting a full-court press on 25-year-old Japanese pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who’s expected to be posted in a few weeks. 
– Yankees president Randy Levine ripped the two Florida teams this past week at a Sportico sports conference, saying he’s tired of paying the Marlins and Rays revenue-sharing money. 
“A lot more focus has to be on individual teams to do better and not just rely on revenue sharing,” Levine said. “You can’t have two Florida teams averaging 15,000 fans. You can’t have it. You don’t go into an NFL stadium or an NBA arena and see that.  
“And I think that there’s been a dependency issue that’s got to get better. … The commissioner has done an incredible job, but now it’s on individual teams. Instead of complaining and whining, ‘We need more money,’ you got to take some responsibility.” 
The Rays averaged 17,781 fans this season while the Marlins averaged 14,355 fans. 
– The Dodgers, whose No. 1 target this winter remains Shohei Ohtani, say that simply winning the NL West is no longer acceptable. 
They have won 211 regular-season games in two years but only one in October, after being swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks this year. 
“For a team this talented to play 27 innings where we do not hold a lead," Dodgers president Andrew Friedman said, “it’s something we have to figure out."

Booking airline tickets for your next cruise may seem like a no-brainer, but please don't make the mistake of turning off your brain. You could be paying for a new flight – or even getting stranded at the port.
Just ask Beverly Rasmussen, who booked her airfare through the EZAir program offered by Princess Cruises because it offered the "reassurance that it will get you to your ship" when there's a delay. But when her airline canceled her flight and couldn't get through to the EZAir department by phone, she had to pay $1,517 for new tickets.
Check outElliott Confidential, the newsletter the travel industry doesn't want you to read. Each issue is filled with breaking news, deep insights, and exclusive strategies for becoming a better traveler. But don't tell anyone!
So much for the guarantee.
She said she's called Princess numerous times but has gotten nowhere.
"Each time we sit on hold for hours, then the line disconnects," said Rasmussen, a retired nurse from North Ogden, Utah.
America's train system doesn'tfavor you: Here is who to blame, how to begin fixing it
No babies on flights, planes?Why we should rethink how the little ones travel.
If you're thinking of taking a cruise soon, maybe you're wondering about airline tickets. Then again, probably not. Travel advisors say airline tickets are often an afterthought to the cruise, a decision made at the end of the booking.
But let's not do that today. Wave season – the time of year when most cruises are booked – is dead ahead. And with the industry trade association Cruise Lines International Association predicting that global cruise capacity will rise 19% from 2022 to 2028 (up from 625,000 berths to 746,000), you don't want to make a rookie mistake.
"The last thing you need is to miss the cruise and then have to get to the next port," said Limor Decter, a luxury travel advisor with EMBARK Beyond. "No one needs that kind of drama."
There are no publicly available statistics on the number of passengers who miss their cruise because of airline connections. But based on the number of cases I've received lately, it seems to be a growing problem. Passengers don't think about it soon enough, that's true, but cruise lines also impose significant restrictions on their air-inclusive programs.
Booking airline tickets through your cruise line may seem like a good deal, because they often offer guarantees that you will make it to your ship even if your flight is delayed. 
There are other benefits. The special contract fares offered through cruise lines are sometimes cheaper than published airfares. The cruise line air programs also often allow you to hold flight reservations until the final payment date. You can change flights at any time before making your final payment. You can't easily do that if you book directly with the airline.
But there are also some downsides – which is to say, some restrictions apply. After Debra Stewart missed her recent Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) cruise because of a flight cancellation, she found out that the Booksafe Travel Protection Plan had a few strings attached. NCL would only offer a future cruise credit equal to 75% of the non-refundable cancellation charge because her flight cancellation was not covered under the Booksafe plan. She said that cost her $16,000.
I checked with NCL, and it said the policy had been applied correctly to her Booksafe Protection Plan.
"Although Norwegian Cruise Line provides flight arrangements as part of its cruise offering, we do not have control over the operations of the airlines and are not responsible for any flight modifications or cancelations," a spokesman told me, adding that its claim assessments "are final." 
NCL noted that under its Booksafe Travel Protection Plan, it will provide guests who are denied due to a non-covered reason with a future cruise credit equal to 75% of the non-refundable cancellation charge to use on your next cruise and that it had done so in this case.
"This is so wrong," said Stewart, a physician from Bakersfield, California. "They canceled the flight, I missed my cruise – and I am out $16,000!"
Many of the cruise lines' air-inclusive programs have similar restrictions. They will protect you in most cases, but not all the time. Experts say you can avoid this "gotcha" clause. I'll get to that in a moment.

Visa-free travel for short-term visits to the U.S. for Israelis is now available.
Israel officially became part of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program on Thursday, which allows eligible Israeli citizens and nationals to travel to the U.S. for up to 90 days on business or tourism without having to first obtain a visa.
The admittance came earlier than estimated. On Sept. 27, when admittance to VWP was announced, authorities said it would take until Nov. 30 to complete.
"Israel’s entry into the Visa Waiver Program represents a critical step forward in our strategic partnership with Israel that will further strengthen long-standing people-to-people engagement, economic cooperation, and security coordination between our two countries,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a Sept. 27 statement.
The VWP requires the person looking to come to the U.S. sans visa to "be from a country that extends to U.S. citizens and nationals the privileges we would extend to their citizens and nationals," according to a DHS press release.

People can apply for the program via the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) or via its mobile app. Approval may take up to 72 hours.
To be eligible for VWP, Israeli citizens and nationals must have a biometrically enabled passport book. Currently, the application is only available in English, but other languages are slated to come on Nov. 1.
The change comes as the conflict continues to build in the Middle East. The death toll of Israelis and Palestinians surpassed 5,000 on Thursday, becoming the deadliest war on the Gaza Strip.

Amsterdam will increase its tourist tax in 2024 in a continued effort to crack down on rowdy tourists. The new rate will be the highest in Europe and the fourth highest globally.
The new tax rate for overnight visitors will be 12.5%, up substantially from 7%, according to an announcement by the city earlier this month.
The more expensive tax means tourists will be contributing more to the very city they're enjoying.
"This allows us to address the consequences of overtourism and direct additional resources to keeping the streets clean and solving acute problems in neighbourhoods and districts," Hester van Buren, deputy mayor for finance, said in a statement.

With the average room rate of €175 ($185.32), this translates to a €21.80 ($23.09) per night tax. Currently, the tax would be €15.25 ($16.03).
Cruise passengers will also be paying more too. The current tax is €8 ($8.41), and it's slated to go up to €11 ($11.56) per person per day.
By increasing the tourist tax, the city said it won't raise parking fees or property tax rates for its residents, according to the announcement. The tourist tax revenue will go directly into enhancing Amsterdam neighborhoods, such as growing the city's green spaces.
Next up on the to-do list is finding a way to tax day-trippers, van Buren told DutchNews.
The city's ongoing battle between troublesome tourists and locals goes back years. In 2019, the city banned guided tours in the Red Light District and this past March, launched a "Stay Away" campaign.
Amsterdam isn't the only city making travelers pay for their share. A few weeks ago, Iceland announced a tourist tax that would help protect its natural resources, which are a main draw for visitors. So did Venice and Bali. Even places in the U.S. charge a tourist tax. In Honolulu, travelers have to pay a total of 13.25% for their accommodations, and that money supports services like lifeguards and hiking trail maintenance.

UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay.
Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports.
Their partnership should have been a force for good. Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.
The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.
Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.
But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.
According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.
“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”
In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”
“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”
Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.
The stakes are high for everyone.
Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.
Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.
Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.
Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.
“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”
USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.
Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.
For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.
Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.
For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.
“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”
Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.
Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.
At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.
By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.
Tucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.
Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline
Tucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.
Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.
Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.
Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.
During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.
They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.
In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”
It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.
Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.
Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.
They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.
Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.
By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.
Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.
Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”
Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.
Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.
Twelve days later came the call.
Tracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.
According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.
“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”
Tracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”
She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.
“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”
Tracy said she thought to herself, "Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it." In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”
When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.
Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.
Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.
At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.
Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.
When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.
Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.
Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”
Tucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.
The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.
Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.
She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.
Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.
“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”
The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.
A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.
Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.
Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.
Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.
Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.
Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.
“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.
Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.
Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.
Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.
Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.
They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.
“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”
Michigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.
The case would go forward.
Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22.
He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.
For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.
Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.
An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.
Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.
During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”
Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.
“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”
Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.
Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.
Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.
Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.
At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.
Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.
Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”
Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.
One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.
A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”
“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”

On a sunny Thursday morning, Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker strolled through tomato fields at a farm in Immokalee, Florida, toured its processing plants and loaded baskets of bright green fruit into a truck. 
It was a private event thrown by the school to promote its migrant student services program, which provides financial aid and support to farmworkers seeking college degrees. After the April 28, 2022, tour, disclosed in records obtained by USA TODAY this week, Tucker met with community leaders and alumni.
That night, Tucker would make the now-infamous phone call from his hotel room in nearby Naples, during which he is accused of masturbating and making unwanted sexual comments to Brenda Tracy, a prominent rape survivor and activist he had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence.
Yet, when Tucker met with the university’s outside investigator in March for his interview in the sexual harassment case against him, he insisted the trip was not work-related – a claim the investigator would disprove in her report.
It’s just one example of Tucker failing to keep his story straight at the most consequential moment of his career. 
With his job, reputation and the roughly $80 million left on his contract at stake, Tucker repeatedly made false statements to the investigator and misled her about basic facts, such as his location during the phone call and the date it occurred, a USA TODAY review of more than 1,200 pages of case documents found. 
The investigator, Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, and the news organization both obtained documents and witness statements that discredit key aspects of Tucker’s version of events. 
Michigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sept. 10, hours after Tracy went public for the first time with her story in USA TODAY. On Monday, the school informed Tucker it plans to fire him for cause based on the conduct he had admitted to and the embarrassment he had caused the school. 
Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivor
Although Tucker denied sexually harassing Tracy, he acknowledged masturbating on the call, saying he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex.” Tracy said Tucker’s romantic interest in her was completely one-sided and that she had tried to set boundaries multiple times during their yearlong business partnership.
Per his contract, Tucker has until Tuesday to make a case for keeping his job. Regardless, a formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated school policies against sexual harassment and exploitation is expected to proceed on Oct. 5 and 6. 
Since his suspension, Tucker has issued multiple public statements defending himself, attacking Tracy and accusing Veidlinger of bias. He accused the school of conducting a “sham” hearing and having “ulterior motives.” Yet even in these written statements, the central details of his story changed entirely.
Tucker, who previously hung up on a reporter who called him on his cellphone asking about the case, did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. His attorney, Jennifer Belveal, has not responded to phone calls and emails. Tracy declined to comment for this story.
In the absence of eyewitnesses or recordings, sexual harassment cases usually boil down to whose account is more credible, said Elizabeth Abdnour, a Lansing-based attorney and former Michigan State Title IX investigator who has taken part in dozens of campus cases.
“It’s very, very unusual that you would have some outside piece of evidence that would give you a clear decision,” Abdnour said. “Very often you’re weighing credibility based on little bits and pieces of information.” 
In multiple cases she has worked, Abdnour said the respondents lost because they were found to have a greater propensity for lying than the complainants. The hearing officer must determine how much weight to give Tucker’s false and conflicting statements, Abdnour said, and they could sway the case in Tracy’s favor.
“I believe a fact finder could assess these pieces of evidence about credibility and make a determination that Brenda is more credible than Mel,” she said. “In my experience, a clear sign of a lack of credibility is generally taken very seriously.”
By the time Tucker met with Veidlinger for his interview, he had had months to prepare.
The school had informed him of Tracy’s complaint on Dec. 22, the day after she filed it. Veidlinger had interviewed Tracy and all six of her witnesses by the end of January. Tucker was the only holdout.
Rather than tell his side of the story right away, Tucker and his attorney spent three months trying to stop the investigation, case documents show. They wrote legal arguments urging Michigan State to drop the case and twice approached Tracy’s attorney proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no, and the school pressed forward.
On March 22, the day of his interview, Tucker sent Veidlinger a seven-page written account of his interactions with Tracy and lists of their “currently existing” text message and call history, which he said his legal team had compiled. Only a handful of text messages remained; he and Tracy both told the investigator they had deleted their texts with each other in the months after the April 2022 phone call.
In his interview, which lasted 3 ½ hours, Tucker questioned whether Tracy had mixed up the date of the call. He said he recalled being at his home in East Lansing when it occurred, but his own records showed that he had been in Florida on April 28, attending a charity function that was “absolutely not a University-sponsored event.”
His seven-page account told a different story – that he had called her while he was “alone in a hotel room.”
Veidlinger does not appear to have asked Tucker about the discrepancy, based on case documents. But by then she knew what he told her in the interview was untrue: she had already obtained records proving he had not been home in East Lansing.
An expense report he had submitted to the university for reimbursement of his hotel and meals shows Tucker flew to Naples, Florida, to attend a golf fundraiser hosted by The Greg H. Montgomery Jr. Foundation for Ultimate Growth, which raises awareness for suicide prevention. It showed he stayed at the Hilton from April 27 to 29, that the trip’s purpose was “administrative” and that it did not involve personal travel. He had flown there on a donor’s private plane.
The trip is when Tucker toured the farm in Immokalee to help promote Michigan State’s College Assistance Migrant Program. The event was titled “Working to make dreams a reality,” according to an agenda obtained from the university by USA TODAY through a public records request. The agenda features Tucker’s name prominently. Tucker posted photos from the tour on his Twitter account.
That Tucker was on a university-sponsored work trip during the incident was a contributing factor in the university’s determination that it had jurisdiction to investigate, the investigation report shows. 
Tucker’s lists of calls and text messages also were missing an important detail: They did not show any communication with Tracy on April 28. He acknowledged in the interview, however, that he had not reviewed the lists before submitting them and that they may have been incomplete.
Tracy, meanwhile, had already provided Veidlinger with her official cellphone records from Sprint that confirmed the date of their call: April 28.
Tucker and Tracy did not speak in the three months after the April 28 call.
Meanwhile, their assistants were planning Tracy’s third visit to campus – an in-person training with coaches and players scheduled for July 25.
Tucker canceled that training three days before, the investigation report shows. When Tracy spoke to him by phone on Aug. 2 seeking to find out why, she would tell the investigator in her interview that Tucker insinuated he would harm her career if she spoke about his conduct. He never rescheduled her visit, and they never spoke again.
The cancellation became a key focus of the investigator – one of a series of alleged incidents that taken together would meet the definition of sexual harassment, which can include pressuring someone into engaging in sexual behavior for an employment benefit and threatening that rejecting such behavior will carry a negative consequence.
“Reported allegations that a University employee is engaging in misconduct within the vendor-vendee relationship for which they are the decision-maker, and/or impeding in such a services relationship based on a quid-pro-quo sexual harassment allegation, is within a University sponsored program or activity,” Veidlinger wrote in the report, so school policy covered it.
Tucker tried to distance himself from the cancellation in a public statement on Sept. 11, the day after Michigan State suspended him without pay.
“I never cancelled any presentation,” he wrote. “Given a personnel change and scheduling challenges as football season approached, we merely postponed it until January 2023. She chose to file her complaint instead of proceeding with the training.”
But that statement contradicts what he told the investigator. When Veidlinger asked in his March interview if he had a role in canceling Tracy’s visit, Tucker said, “Yes, absolutely I did,” the report shows, and that he did not recall any discussions about rescheduling Tracy for January. Such timing would not make sense, he added, because most of his new players would not yet be on campus. 
Tucker also told the investigator why he canceled the visit, blaming it on a scheduling conflict. He said he had recently hired a mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, who needed to implement his new program on short notice. There was limited time in fall camp, Tucker said, and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” the players. He said he decided to yield the time to Newman.
Veidlinger, however, would later obtain records showing Newman did not meet with the team on July 25, the day of Tracy’s planned visit. He had been meeting with them weekly since June 6, the records showed but held no meetings between July 15 and July 28.
One of Tucker’s assistants, who is a witness in the case, also told the investigator that Tucker asked him via text message to cancel it. He said he was never instructed to reschedule. 
In his interview, Tucker told Veidlinger that his relationship with Tracy frayed after the April 2022 phone call – not because of the incident, but because of information he learned after that caused him not to trust her.
According to Tucker, an associate of his had told him over the summer that Tracy’s assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, had been gossiping about Tucker’s marriage, telling others it was “on the rocks.” Tucker said he was “devastated” because he had confided in Tracy about his marital problems, and he believed she had discussed them with Alvarado.
Tucker confronted Tracy about the alleged gossiping during the Aug. 2 phone call, they both told the investigator. Tracy said he berated and bullied her, repeatedly saying he could not trust her. She said she told him she did not know what he was talking about.
Alvarado – who was killed in a car crash in June – would deny discussing Tucker’s marriage with anyone in her January interview with Veidlinger. 
During the Aug. 2 call, Tracy said she pressed Tucker to identify his source – the associate. She told Veidlinger she believed Tucker had made it up as a pretext for canceling her visit and ending her relationship with the school.
Veidlinger also asked Tucker to reveal the source of his claim, but he refused to say. In her report, she wrote that he said he had “given (his) word that (he) wouldn’t divulge their name.” 
Tucker never revealed the associate’s name to the investigator, nor did he identify anyone who could support his version of events. In his Sept. 11 public statement, however, he lamented that the hearing would not afford him the opportunity to “offer any substantive evidence of innocence.”
It was not the only claim he attributed to his anonymous associate. In his interview, he said that same person told him that ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating how Tracy “goes about her business” by claiming to be a rape survivor.  
Tucker said this further caused him to believe Tracy was untrustworthy because she believed Lavigne was her friend but didn’t know she was investigating the rape story at the center of her public persona. 
It turned out to be yet another falsehood.
Reached by USA TODAY, Lavigne said in an emailed statement that she was “perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.” She said Tracy has been a source of information for her for several years, and that she has featured Tracy’s comments and advocacy work in multiple news stories.
“That has been the extent of my reporting on Tracy and her organization,” Lavigne wrote. “Neither the organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting.”
Asked who might have told Tucker this misinformation, Lavigne responded, “I have absolutely no idea who would have alleged this to anyone.”

The bullets came in plywood crates. 
Any given box was about the size of a small microwave oven. The printed label stuck to each one demonstrated a militaristic brevity. “CARTRIDGES FOR WEAPONS, INERT PROJECTILE,” next to a bright yellow hazmat sticker, “EXPLOSIVES.” 
Inside the boxes: drab green steel cans of .50-caliber ammunition. Each round was giant, more than 5 inches long, built to be fired from a gun so big it is typically bolted to a truck. The bullets were clipped together in long strands for rapid, machine-gun fire. 
By the time Bill Brown got to the boxes, they sat double-stacked eight high atop wooden pallets inside a Missouri warehouse. The pallets went on, row after row. Three million bullets in all. 
It was enough ammunition to feed a single machine gun – if fired nonstop at its rated speed eight hours a day, seven days a week – for almost six months. 
Brown’s job was to get it out of there and toward the Ukrainian front lines. The faster, the better. 
“War is bad,” Brown said. “Loss of life is bad. But at the end of the day, it’s very profitable and injects revenue into this military industrial base.”
There would be virtually no public record of this Ukrainian arms shipment. As a weapons dealer, Brown’s company would deliver the bullets under a system known as a direct commercial sale. The ammunition required a State Department signoff – but the secret deal would never appear in a White House announcement or the Congressional Record. 
Instead, it was part of a shadowy system of brokers, exporters, arms dealers and country-to-country transfers that has become one part of the race to meet demand on distant battlefields. 
Western weaponry fueled Ukraine’s summertime counteroffensive along a 600-mile front. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the effort was delayed in part by the wait for more arms. Amid concerns about that slowly progessing counteroffensive, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday with a promise of up to $175 million more in military equipment. 
Most of America’s $44 billion in documented support to Ukraine came in the form of old U.S. military stock, donated directly by the federal government. In general, commercial sales over $14 million, and sales of military-grade weaponry like mortars or missiles, require State Department approval and congressional notification.
But other aid comes via private sales. 
More than 14,000 U.S. entities are registered to conduct defense trade activities. Their deals are monitored by an alphabet soup of agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Trade secrecy clauses in federal law mean this flow of gear, weapons and ammunition is almost never revealed to the public.
Brown, who works for a small Nevada-based logistics company called Battle Born Munitions, provided USA TODAY with a rare look behind the curtain of these private sales. Details about the shipment were verified by his employer and the European government that made the purchase. State Department officials declined to answer questions about the specific shipment Brown described.
This March sale and the secret number of other shipments like it fuel Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion. Those sales also release an unknown amount of weaponry into the world. What becomes of that weaponry after it’s sold – and especially after it’s delivered – is difficult to track. 
As Brown surveyed the warehouse in Missouri, a crew steered forklifts and skid lifts among the stacks of plain wooden boxes. From high in the trusses, suspended lamp fixtures bathed the boxes in artificial daylight. Brown lifted his camera and started snapping photos. 
In just a few hours, he and his cargo would be boarding a jumbo jet. Three million bullets would climb to the stratosphere and hurtle across the north Atlantic toward a European dawn.
From Ukraine:War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented. So is the country's push for swift justice.
The bullets had once been bound for Saudi Arabia. 
Lot number SMQ19K401L026 had rolled off the assembly line in 2019 at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Kansas City. Lake City, owned by the government and run by a contractor, sprawls across nearly 4,000 acres of green Missouri farmland. Roads curve past World War II-era bunkers known as igloos, spaced out amid the countryside – far enough apart that an explosion in one won’t trigger a chain reaction in the others.
Lake City has been pumping out ammunition almost without pause since 1941. It is the largest small-arms manufacturing plant in the world.
Today the plant is run by Olin-Winchester, but in 2019, the bullets were made by some of the 1,700 workers employed by Northrop Grumman. And in 2019, Saudi Arabia was stocking up on weapons during the Trump administration, fueling the war in Yemen and other conflicts that drew criticism from congressional Democrats.
The plant manufactures .50-caliber ammunition on a rolling basis, for both military and commercial buyers. That’s a testament to just what a legend the bullet – and the gun that shoots it – has become.
In 2019, the technology was already a century old. The .50 caliber was the brainchild of American gunsmith John Browning during World War I. Built to respond to German anti-tank rifles, the M2 was first tested in 1918, and it entered widespread service in 1923. It earned the nickname “Ma Deuce” and has served in combat ever since, bolted to trucks, ships, planes and handheld stands on the battlefield.
The .50-caliber rounds – named for their diameter, about half an inch – can easily hit targets more than a mile away. At closer ranges, they will blast through solid concrete or armored vehicles. The gun can fire at a sustained rate of about 40 shots per minute.
Military setups use strings of “linked” ammunition to feed into machine guns. Spaced out after every fourth bullet, so-called tracer rounds have small pyrotechnic charges that illuminate the line of fire, aiding in targeting.
The gun’s longevity and versatility made it popular for militaries the world over. But this particular batch of bullets wouldn’t end up being sold to Saudi Arabia. 
The Biden administration put a temporary freeze on sales to the Saudi government in 2021 as it reviewed weapons deals approved under Donald Trump. Instead, Brown said, the bullets were sold to a U.S. ammunition provider, only to be held up again. Ultimately, they were mothballed. 
Then, in spring 2023, the bullets found a buyer, or actually two: first Battle Born; ultimately, the Netherlands. 
The European country, a NATO ally, needed a big supply of ammunition. It wouldn’t be keeping the bullets but giving them to Ukraine. Its purchase, essentially a donation, would count toward the country’s required NATO contribution. 
Brown had a line on exactly what they needed. It was sitting in the warehouse in Missouri. 
He arrived in March to personally oversee the shipment. As he prepped for delivery, Brown dropped tiny black tracking devices onto several of the pallets. Just $55 apiece, the units use GPS and cell signals to keep tabs on the load. The idea was to ensure it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands. 
But packing up the bullets was just the beginning. As with anything that’s deadly and made of metal, the shipping costs can be extreme. 
Brown said the question for the buyer was simple: “How fast do you want it? Forty-five to 60 days on a ship? Or in five days if I fly it?”
Brown – or Chief Bill, as he prefers – is a no-nonsense 35-year veteran of the U.S. Army and former helicopter pilot. He retired as a chief warrant officer and lives in Orlando. 
Now 59, he still spends a lot of time on the road – 10 international trips this year. He says his arms logistics work takes him to places most Americans would rather avoid – near the Syrian border or to unstable regions of Iraq.
He’ll travel halfway around the world, he quips, “have some soup, and go back to Warsaw to head home.” The trips aren’t really about the destinations. They’re about the cargo. 
On that spring day in Missouri, forklifts carefully loaded 107 pallets of the ammo onto 18 flatbed semitrailers. They’d all make the eight-hour drive to O’Hare International Airport. 
In Chicago, two Boeing 747-400s operated by National Airlines would be ready for the freight. 
Four pallets each were stacked and shrink-wrapped to create “air pallets” or “cookie sheets” weighing 12,800 pounds. Each plane could carry up to 17 of the pallets that ran the length of each plane secured by white cargo netting.
Flight records Brown provided show the two planes departed about seven hours apart, one in early afternoon, one after dark. 
The flight would take nine hours. Brown wasn’t going to the Netherlands, even though it was the buyer. The planes were bound for Rzeszów, Poland. 
The ancient city sits at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland. It has a gleaming modern airport next to a major east-west freeway. From there, it’s barely 60 miles to the border with Ukraine. 
It was an expensive journey. The trucking company’s bill for those 18 semis? $85,000. Chartering the two 747s? $625,000. Each.
But this shipment of .50-cal rounds was profitable for Battle Born Munitions, according to Brown.
The company purchased the 3 million rounds from Northrop Grumman at a bargain and resold them for more than double the price. (In subsequent interviews, representatives at BBM disputed the specific totals Brown mentioned, saying the accurate figures were protected by “various commercial and government non-disclosure agreements.” They did not dispute the other specifics of the deal he provided.) 
Retail prices for .50-caliber ammunition run roughly $5 per bullet. At that rate, the whole shipment would have been worth $15 million.
The pricing might also be elastic. The Dutch mark up the price of the bullets and count it toward their NATO contribution, pegged to a percentage of gross domestic product, Brown said. The Netherlands has contributed about $15 billion to NATO this year, or about 1.7% of its GDP and just under the NATO mandate of 2%.
Representatives of the Dutch military confirmed the shipment to USA TODAY but declined to comment further about the pricing or details.
The war in Ukraine has only increased the demand for private deals. The State Department signed off on more than $154 billion in commercial arms deals directly to foreign countries in 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year. 
Direct commercial sales represent a modest portion of the contribution to Ukraine compared with the $44 billion donated by the U.S., but they still amounted to more than $600 million in sales from U.S. companies to the Ukrainian government last year alone. That doesn’t include sales to other countries that also support Ukraine – sales like the one Brown described.
Jim Bartlett, an attorney with expertise in the specialized international arms transactions, said private U.S. businesses are playing a small but important role in the conflict.
“American companies are happy to export defense articles to foreign buyers approved by the U.S. State Department,” Bartlett said. “There’s an effort at the State Department to quickly clear the ones headed for Ukraine. … You get head-of-the-line privileges.”
Those sales also come with risks. 
Direct sales face fewer regulatory controls, oversight and enforcement, said Robert Nichols, an international military sales expert and attorney at the law firm Nichols Liu.
“You can imagine the range of characters involved in supplying a war effort,” Nichols said. “Some are highly credible. Others will skirt the law and sometimes step over the line by paying bribes, committing fraud and hiding their transactions.” 
So far, the Department of Justice has indicted just a handful of arms brokers over deals related to the war in Ukraine. Court records show the government has charged Miami-based Oleg Patsulya and Vasilii Besedin with illegally attempting to sell American-made aircraft parts to Russia. They allegedly lied to Commerce Department agents and told them the parts were bound for Turkey. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges this summer. 
A State Department spokesman declined to provide details of enforcement actions but said, “The United States takes seriously our responsibility to protect American military and dual-use technologies and prevent their diversion, including through strong enforcement actions.”
NATO said it oversees allied arms deliveries, and that those arms generally reach Ukraine. NATO itself technically only provides non-non-lethal aid, like fuel, medical supplies and generators.
Brown, of Battle Born, says he fields calls weekly from “clowns” without the proper licensing, whom he reports to the State Department for potential violations. Some raise red flags when they approach him about transactions that include payment via diamonds or gold.
He prefers traditional wire transfers with approved sales partners since he knows government officials are watching. He validates the contracts and checks certificates for the final users. That’s part of why he traveled with the ammunition. He would be meeting a Dutch military official for the official handoff.
“My job is to keep us all out of jail,” Brown said. 
The two 747s touched down in Poland, one before the sun, the other in late morning. Brown exchanged paperwork with a young Dutch military staffer who signed for the delivery, he said. They traded military patches as souvenirs. They snapped a photo together. 
The bullets bought by the Netherlands would never touch Dutch soil. 
U.S. aid:Billions from the US flows to Ukraine. Here's where it comes from, and how it adds up
Despite playing a small role proportionately in the war, $600 million in direct commercial sales can buy a lot of small weaponry. 
And those weapons are the kind most apt to fall into illicit use, said Elias Yousif, a research analyst at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit think tank.
Put another way: It’s hard to sneak away an F-16 or a missile launcher the size of a tractor-trailer. But a bunch of guns or a pallet of ammo? Much easier to resell. 
“In the commercial sector, especially in a new market, the risk increases,” Yousif said.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss arms research project, estimated that within a year, battlefield seizures and other forms of diversion led to 300,000 small arms and light weapons going missing, including 100,000 in Crimea alone.
When small arms go missing, they can go missing into another country, maybe one led by a despot or even a terrorist organization.
The U.S. government says diversion of American donations has been widely absent so far in Ukraine. That could be a combination of intensive “end-use-monitoring” programs and the reality of the battlefield, where supplies are rapidly put to use.
But even if not now, unused ammo could be resold someday. 
“History shows us this isn’t a short-term issue,” Yousif said.  “These are commodities with very long shelf lives.” 
Florida-based Global Ordnance, another State Department-licensed exporter, is a competitor in the direct weapons sales business. General counsel Bryan Van Brunt said the company has extensive protocols in place to track shipments and make sure the end-users are federally approved, though he declined to provide specifics about those systems. 
Brown, with Battle Born Munitions, says the company employs a mix of simple and sophisticated tracking technology to ensure his shipments are tracked to end users. The black GPS devices he dropped onto his cargo tracked the ammo all the way across the globe.
But that system only works as long as Brown is actually tracking. “Technically, my role ends when I deliver it to NATO,” he said.
Sometime after the 747s touched down in Poland, along with signing the paperwork and snapping a selfie with the Dutch official, Brown found the tiny black GPS trackers and lifted them off the pallets. 
Ukrainian trucks would arrive at the airport to pick up the ammunition. They would point toward the border, and onward to Lviv, and some distant battlefield. 
Brown would point in the opposite direction. Just like one of his quips: Fly in, have soup, get home. He headed toward Warsaw, with the GPS trackers in his bag.

The geography professor didn’t hide his clown fetish or the fact that he sometimes indulged his urges by recruiting students as subjects. He posted regularly about it on social media.
“I have a facepaint fetish and convince the cute girls in my classes to let me paint their faces,” he once wrote.
Yet Joseph Tokosh held jobs at two colleges and was on the tenure track at a third before student journalists at Nicholls State University in Louisiana exposed his behavior. He submitted his resignation the same day their story was published.
His interactions with students and open discussion of his fetish happened in both mainstream and tailored digital spaces. He popped into Facebook groups geared toward new students and niche forums on websites like Reddit. He posted videos on YouTube. In one Reddit post on a forum meant to highlight hard-to-believe stories, Tokosh posted pictures of several women in white face paint.
Over the years, two students reported him to campus police; others complained online. He left Kent State University after pleading no contest to something different: a theft charge that involved entering his peers’ offices without permission and taking a USB drive. Tokosh has not been charged with any other crime.
Tokosh’s career trajectory exposes inadequacies in the background check system that colleges and universities are supposed to have in place to protect students – especially when evidence of the concerning behavior resides largely on the internet. Nicholls State, for example, told USA TODAY Network reporters it does not routinely check social media for new hires.
A federal law intended to ensure the academic privacy of students also makes it difficult to determine how Tokosh was able to move so freely from campus to campus. Both Kent State and Northern Illinois University – where he taught while finishing his doctorate – noted Tokosh’s protected status as a graduate student in declining to answer questions.
Sophie Levan was a freshman at Kent State in 2017 when she encountered Tokosh, then 28, in a Facebook group intended as a gathering place for new students. Tokosh had offered cash to anyone willing to let him paint their faces. Levan, then 18, agreed.
The money was appealing but the interactions soured. 
Tokosh, she said, insisted he come pick her up and take her to the building that housed the geography department, where he would paint her face. Uneasy, Levan stopped responding. Tokosh got angry and wouldn’t give up, she said, which led her to file a police report.
“I felt like the school would want to know about it,” Levan said. “I thought maybe they could prevent anything bad from happening since other girls would go with him.”
She said there was never any followup from campus police – or anyone else.
USA TODAY Network reporters reviewed the experiences of six students who were the subject of Tokosh’s attention going back to his time at Kent State.
In addition to Levan, the other person who reported Tokosh to campus police could not be reached for comment. The two who expressed public concerns on social media told USA TODAY they never heard from their campus officials either.
USA TODAY attempted to reach Tokosh via phone, social media and a certified letter. A person answered a phone call to a number associated with Tokosh, but he hung up after the reporter identified himself. A reporter also reached someone who identified herself as Tokosh’s mother. She said she would pass along that reporters were trying to reach him.
Tokosh told the Nicholls student journalists that he did have an assignment where students were required to paint their faces as part of a cultural exercise. Prior to the article in the student newspaper The Nicholls Worth, the university had already cut Tokosh loose. He said his contract was not renewed because he was the target of a “grade inflation task force.”
The university, however, “does not have any such task force,” according to Nicholls spokesman Jerad David.
Tokosh also told students the face painting was a requirement in his cultural geography class to better understand other cultures. In a video interview with Hannah Robert, the station manager for the student-run KNSU TV, he says: “That's an assignment in one of my classes where they actually come up with their own face paint and makeup design inspired by a culture and they implement it.”
It’s a well-established trend in the academic world for professors to bounce from one institution to another without having to disclose why they left their last post, said Julie Libarkin, an associate dean at Michigan State University. She has seen the pattern often in her work maintaining a database of publicly documented sexual misconduct by faculty and staff.
As for grad students? Libarkin said people have requested she add them to her list, but universities’ conservative interpretations of the law get in the way.
“I don’t on purpose,” she said, “because that’s information that almost never comes out.”
Tokosh arrived at Kent State in 2015 with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in geography from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, according to his curriculum vitae. He was working toward his doctorate and researched fading businesses. His work about shopping malls in the Rust Belt won several awards. Like many graduate students, he also taught classes.
Then, Tokosh started showing up in the Facebook groups for new students. In a December 2017 post, an account under the name “Joe Tokosh” posted several pictures of women made up to look like clowns or skulls.
“If anyone is looking for some extra cash, I am looking for people to practice facepainting on!” he wrote. “I will literally pay you!”
Those are the types of posts that caught Levan’s eye. Not only was she pressed for cash, she was interested in movie makeup and thought the face painting could be fun based on the photos Tokosh had posted. But Levan said she soon realized that those images were stock photos and not representative of what Tokosh could do.
What’s more, she figured out that he was a graduate student, a fact she said he didn’t disclose in his posts.
When Tokosh offered to pick her up from her dorm, she refused. But, she said, Tokosh kept insisting she agreed to participate. Levan stopped responding to his messages and filed a police report with the Kent State police in January 2018. They advised her only to stop talking to Tokosh, she said, and let them know if “anything of consequence occurred.”
Months after she refused to meet up and filed the police report, Tokosh texted a picture of himself wearing white face paint to her cellphone. It arrived at midnight and contained no message, although writing on his shirt read: “I'm not a failure.”  
“There was some negative intention with sending that photo,” Levan said. “It’s definitely burned into my mind.”
What Levan didn’t know is that campus police had been put on notice a year earlier when another student filed a similar report. That student told police Tokosh reached out to her and her friends after they posted their numbers on a Facebook group for undergraduates. He would send “get to know you” messages, the police report said, and then ask the student if she was “interested in having her face painted for one of his class projects.”
When she found out Tokosh was a graduate student, she said no and eventually blocked him on Facebook and Snapchat, according to the report. Tokosh continued to text her.
“She does not have any concerns for her safety, but just wanted this documented,” the police report read. 
In July 2017, another student had retweeted a message from Kent State’s Twitter account that asked for Kent State love stories. She wrote: “A geography professor requested me on facebook and asked if he could paint my face like a clown.”
The student confirmed to USA TODAY that the professor was Tokosh and shared a screenshot of a Facebook friend request he sent her. She said she suspected Tokosh also found her on a freshman Facebook group because she posted there often.
She said she tweeted to draw officials’ attention to it and moved on but now wishes she had reported it officially.
College campuses are supposed to offer students special protections from sexual harassment even when it falls short of criminal behavior. Title IX, often associated with equity in women’s sports, also addresses “sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence” at schools that receive federal funding.
Colleges infrequently and unevenly enforce the rule, however. A 2022 USA TODAY investigation found just one of every 12,400 students was suspended in connection with sexual misconduct.
The student who shared her story online said the only response she received was from a graduate student in the geography department, who contacted her on Oct. 1, 2018. In an email, he wrote that he had seen her post and suspected he knew which faculty member had asked her about face painting.
“I brought it to the attention of some of our faculty because I was pretty sure I knew who it was, but they were certain it wasn’t that individual and that you probably just meant geology,” he wrote. 
He went on to reference another student being “approached in (at least by just looking at your tweet) a much more aggressive way.” The grad student asked the undergraduate for more information, but, she told USA TODAY, she didn’t respond. She said she started drafting a reply, but a year had passed. She wanted to move on.
Kent State would not say whether any actions were taken after the students’ reports, but Eric Mansfield, a spokesman for the university, said the police department confirmed that the students who filed police reports were provided with “university resources, which would include other non-criminal avenues to pursue (Counseling Services, Title IX, Center for Sexual and Relationship Violence Services, etc.) as a general police practice.”
Levan does not recall police offering her services, but she said she didn’t want counseling. She wanted Tokosh investigated.
Mansfield also said that the university monitors social media but that colleges “can’t always see or track every mention on social media.”
Police records show that officers did investigate when Tokosh was accused of breaking into geography department offices. A blotter item in the local newspaper shows police obtained an arrest warrant in connection with a third-degree felony burglary charge. Court documents indicate Tokosh pleaded no contest to a theft on Oct. 19, 2018.
Kent State would not explain what led to Tokosh’s departure during that fall semester. Instead, the university said that since Tokosh was a graduate student, any information about him was protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It also would not say whether school officials shared Tokosh’s disciplinary record with other colleges or even if it was standard practice to do so for grad students.
“Due to FERPA, student education records are private,” said Emily Vincent, a university spokeswoman. “Also, we do not comment on personnel matters.”
When Congress passed FERPA in 1974, its author, Sen. James L. Buckley of New York, said the intent was to protect the academic privacy of students and their families. In more recent years, Buckley has become critical of the law and how schools interpret it. He told the Columbus Dispatch in 2010 that “the law needs to be revamped.”
Survivors of sexual violence and students accuse universities of using the law to avoid negative media coverage. Students with a history of bad behavior may jump from one school to another without the public ever knowing about their histories. Law enforcement records don’t fall under FERPA’s purview, but a wide variety of questionable behavior does.
One case involved Brandon Austin, who was accused of sexual assault at Providence College in 2013 while on the school’s basketball team. But Providence College initially said Austin was suspended for violating the school’s code of student conduct and declined to share further details with the Providence Journal, citing federal privacy laws. Austin denied wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime. 
Austin was able to transfer to the University of Oregon, where he was again accused of sexual assault, along with other players. Police investigated the claims, and the local district attorney declined to press charges. The university expelled him anyway but raised FERPA when it declined to release records showing what Oregon knew about the allegations, according to the Oregonian.
LeRoy Rooker was the director of the U.S. Education Department office that oversaw FERPA for more than two decades. Rooker, now a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said FERPA is not a confidentiality law – it is focused on education records. And it doesn’t apply when a student is “seeking or intending to enroll” at another college.
Therefore, Rooker said, Kent State could have shared information about Tokosh with Northern Illinois.
Rooker also said FERPA would not have prevented Kent State from telling reporters if other universities had inquired about Tokosh, though they could not have disclosed what they shared.
He blamed the overuse of the law on fear of being sued.
“In this litigious age, institutions get a little wonky about whether they will forward, say, disciplinary records,” Rooker said. “On the other hand, if you have something and you don’t share it when you can and something happens at the next institution, I would say that’s a big liability.”
Backgrounding job applicants has become increasingly complex.
While most U.S. employers conduct background screening, according to trade group data, those inquiries typically focus on criminal history. Social media receives far less attention even though that is where people are most likely to share their unguarded thoughts.
Undertaking a full review of a person’s social media presence is more difficult than just checking an applicant’s Facebook page.
Does an applicant have an account on X, formerly Twitter? How about an account with Discord, an online platform frequented by gamers, where leaked Pentagon documents were recently shared? Or what about a Telegram account, a messaging platform popular among white nationalists? Further complicating things, it’s common on sites like Reddit for users to adopt usernames and describe experiences with little to no ties to reality.
A little digging, however, can turn up a lot of dirt.  
Tokosh has a LinkedIn page that includes his teaching stints at Northern Illinois University and Nicholls State University. His time as a student and instructor at Kent State is absent.
For LinkedIn, a custom URL includes a play on his name and his chosen field of study: Joeography. Tokosh would later use that moniker in promotional materials for a class at Nicholls State. That is the same handle used on Reddit by someone with a special interest in face paint.
One post features a video of Tokosh throwing a pie at someone. Other posts mention a “clown fetish.” In a forum titled “Creepy,” he wrote, “I convince pretty girls to let me paint their faces,” along with a photo with multiple women in white face paint.
That and other similar posts remained live for years until they were taken down after the Nicholls students published their story in late March.
USA TODAY Network reporters captured screenshots before they disappeared. With dates in 2019, the posts feature a young woman wearing a Kent State T-shirt. The material would have been available to administrators at Northern Illinois before the start of the fall 2019 semester.
Joe King, a spokesman for Northern Illinois, said departments hiring new graduate students are “not required to check social media or investigate a disciplinary history.” He added some departments may reach out to the graduate students’ former advisers.
King said he could not determine if the university was aware of Tokosh’s behavior at Kent State. He said that due to FERPA, he could not share specifics about Tokosh’s time at Northern Illinois, including whether students had complained about him.
But there are signs the behavior continued.
A YouTube account under the name “Joe Tokosh” included at least two videos in 2020 of a man throwing pies at women. One of the videos features a young woman also seen in the screenshots from Tokosh’s Reddit account. 
Comments on one from October 2020 read: “You can have a video of her tied up getting pied via cash app.” That video was viewed more than 30,000 times before it was turned off in late July, around the time a USA TODAY reporter reached out to Tokosh.
A former Northern Illinois State student shared text messages exchanged with Tokosh in which he asked to paint her face on multiple occasions. USA TODAY has agreed not to name her because she is concerned Tokosh might retaliate against her.
In the text messages, Tokosh shared a photo of a young woman in white face paint – an image also posted to the Joeography Reddit account. She said she declined to do it but was aware that other Northern Illinois students had participated.
By fall 2022, when he had moved on to Nicholls, Tokosh revealed to the student that he had required students in his cultural geography class to paint their faces.  
The Northern Illinois student asked Tokosh what he did with the photos, and she said he suggested that he might spin them off into a research project someday. She asked, had anyone complained? She said Tokosh responded: Why would they?
Many students would find a reason to complain, as Nicholls State student journalist Sally-Anne Torres learned firsthand. It started in January when one of her fellow reporters picked up an odd rumor: a professor was offering extra credit for students willing to paint their faces like clowns. Initially, Torres dismissed it because it seemed too unusual and there weren’t a lot of leads to follow. 
By Feb. 7, university administrators informed Tokosh that his contract would not be renewed, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY via a records request. They gave no reason for the nonrenewal, but on Feb. 12, Tokosh emailed his students that the university was letting him go. He blamed his departure on giving too many A’s.
That seemed suspicious to Torres. 
During her reporting, she received a tip about Tokosh’s Reddit posts in which he wrote of his “clown fetish” and how he enlisted his students to participate in it.
“It wasn’t just this innocent thing that a lot of these girls thought it was,” Torres said. “As a professor or teacher, that is somebody students are supposed to trust. He used his power to ruin that trust and to do these things, and that made me angry for them.”
Torres spoke to six students who shared their experiences with Tokosh. Some, she said, were followed on Twitter by him while others opted into an extra credit assignment he offered.
The women told Torres he sometimes giggled and laughed as they painted their faces in his office.
On March 27, the Nicholls Worth published a story headlined, “Geography professor suspended immediately, students allege sexual harassment.” KNSU TV, a student broadcast network, also aired footage in which Tokosh defended the assignment on camera. That same day, Tokosh submitted his resignation.
The story’s publication prompted other students to come forward about Tokosh and their frustration with the university.
Bradley Price took an online class with Tokosh and said the professor required students to photograph themselves with their faces painted. Price said Tokosh told them the assignment was to help them understand Japanese culture, but then Tokosh offered him bonus points if he could get a female friend to paint her face.
It seemed unusual at the time, Price said, because his friend wasn’t in the class. It became more concerning to him on reading the student newspaper’s report.
“I feel frankly disgusted and disappointed that Nicholls couldn’t do a proper background check on this professor, because this is unacceptable,” Price said. 
Bella Ramos, a junior at Nicholls State who did not take any of Tokosh’s classes, told USA TODAY that someone using the handle @Joeography21 followed her on Twitter in late 2021 and started liking all her selfies.
Ramos learned that the person behind the account was likely a professor at the university. She posted about the behavior in January 2022, but nothing came of it. She also found the Joeography Reddit account. On March 27, the same day the student newspaper published its piece, Ramos posted screenshots of her discoveries on Twitter with the message, “Found a Nicholls state university professor on Reddit.”
“I wish the university had acted sooner because all this information was public on the internet,” she told USA TODAY. 
No one from the university, she said, has ever reached out.

The soap opera that has consumed members of Congress for nearly three weeks over electing a new speaker is testing the patience of the voters who sent them to Washington, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds.
An overwhelming 67% say the House should elect a speaker as soon as possible, given the need to approve wartime aid for Israel and Ukraine and to prevent a government shutdown that looms next month.
"We got to have a speaker, (but) I don't think we're going to have anybody soon," said George Ramge, 72, of San Diego, a building contractor and political independent. "There's a lot of Hollywood politicians out there getting their time on TV, and I don't think they're really serving the people's purpose."
"They need to be functioning, and that's the only way they're going to function," said Carl Hickey, 85, of Monkton, Maryland, a retired Methodist minister and a Democrat, said in a follow-up interview after being called in the poll.
Just 25% of those surveyed say they don't care whether a speaker is elected, on the theory that the impasse is preventing Congress from wasting more taxpayer money.
"It's not like they do anything anyways," said Dustin Gibbons, 34, a home warranty manager from Queen Creek, Arizona, and a Republican. "I don't think that a speaker in the House is going to do anything other than, you know, just keep kicking that ball along."
The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cell phone Tuesday through Friday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
In a political world where bipartisanship is the exception, there is a broad consensus on this. By double-digit margins, the idea of electing a speaker, and fast, was endorsed not only among Democrats (86%-10%) but also Republicans (57%-34%) and independents (59%-32%).
"How often do you see Democrats, Republicans, and independents agree on anything in DC?" said David Paleologos, director of Suffolk's Political Research Center. "Look at every demographic: gender, geography, age, race, education level, income, political philosophy, even those who trust CNN vs Fox News. They are all speaking the same seven words in unison: 'Elect a speaker and do your job.'"
The previous House speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was ousted from the post by a handful of combative conservatives, just eight of them but enough given the GOP's narrow majority. Since then, no potential successor has been able to command the 217 votes needed. Ohio congressman Jim Jordan was defeated three times before the Republican caucus voted Friday to sideline him.
House Republicans are scheduled to meet late Monday to figure out what to do next.
The scenes of Capitol chaos displayed on cable TV last week may be eroding voters' confidence in the ability of the nation's leaders in the White House and Congress to address the nation's major challenges.
Just 4% of those surveyed express "a lot" of confidence in leaders; another 32% had "some" confidence. But the largest group, 35%, have "very little" confidence and another 27% had none at all.
"If I could go negative five, I would give it a negative 100," Gibbons said.
Democrats, who traditionally have supported a bigger role for government, have more confidence in its ability to solve problems; 63% had "a lot" or "some" confidence.
But Republicans, whose leaders in recent years have portrayed the government as either incompetent or dangerous, were overwhelmingly skeptical that Washington could be trusted to do anything right. A plurality of Republicans, 42%, said they had no confidence in government; another 38% had "very little."
Ratings for the Senate are nothing to brag about, with 36% having a favorable view, and 42% an unfavorable one.
But ratings for the House are even worse. Just 25% see it favorably; more than double that, 54%, view it unfavorably.
Once there is a speaker, most voters have a suggestion of what they want them to do next: A compromise that avoids a government shutdown when the latest temporary funding bill expires Nov. 17.
More than six in 10, 61%, want negotiations to reach a deal. "I mean, don't we live in a bipartisan world?" said Desiree Whitney, 64, of Boerne, Texas, an independent who voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020. "Why should it stop, you know at our government, or does it begin there? I mean, it's all about negotiations."
But there's a catch. While just 31% want their representatives to stand firm on demands to cut spending, even if it means a government shutdown, that group includes a 55% majority of Republicans. Only 37% in the GOP endorse a negotiated compromise.
And Republicans control what happens in the House − assuming, of course, they succeed in electing a speaker.
A prominent Detroit synagogue board president was found stabbed to death early Saturday outside her home. Police have yet to identify a motive or a suspect in her killing.
Samantha Woll, 40, was found outside her home in a neighborhood east of downtown Detroit. She was the board president of Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue, worked for Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin and was on the reelection campaign of Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, also a Democrat.
Religious leaders and public officials decried the killing.
The American Jewish Committee said it was "heartbroken" at the news, calling her a "ray of sunlight to all who knew her" and "a passionate Muslim-Jewish bridge builder." Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan recalled meeting with Woll during a dedication of a renovated synagogue, a project he said she led "with great pride and enthusiasm."
U.S. Rep Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who is Palestinian American and Muslim and represents Detroit, posted on Facebook: "My friend, and a member of our organizing community, Sam Woll, was murdered. I have no words. She always had a sweet smile to offer and the warmest eyes to greet you. Our community is devastated and we are shocked. Please keep her family and our community in your prayers."
Detroit Police offered no clarity about the motive behind the killing by the end of the day, but Chief James White said Saturday night the department was continuing to investigate.
"Understandably, this crime leaves many unanswered questions," he said in a statement. "This matter is under investigation, and I am asking that everyone remain patient while investigators carefully examine every aspect of the available evidence. It is important that no conclusions be drawn until all of the available facts are reviewed."
Earlier, Detroit police said they were investigating a report that a woman had been found unresponsive, with multiple stab wounds, in the 1300 block of Joliet Place in the city's Lafayette Park neighborhood. A trail of blood led back to the victim's home, where police said they believe the crime occurred.
Officials pronounced Woll dead at the scene.
The FBI was aware of the case and has been assisting Detroit police as requested, said Gabrielle Szlenkier, a spokesperson for the FBI's Detroit field office, in an email. The FBI referred all questions to local police.
Woll led the synagogue's board since 2022 and was involved in other local Jewish organizations. A statement sent by Rabbi Ariana Silverman said the synagogue was "shocked and saddened," by Woll's "unexpected death."
"At this point, we do not have more information," the statement said, "but will share more when it becomes available. May her memory be a blessing."
Woll spent much of her career in state and local politics, working on or managing campaigns of Nessel, state Sen. Stephanie Chang, and Denzel McCampbell, who ran for Detroit City Clerk and others.
Chang and Woll attended a wedding together the night before Woll's body was found, and was photographed smiling alongside the bride and groom. Chang and Woll met as students at the University of Michigan more than 15 years ago and remained friends.
"A lot of good" things were happening in Woll's life, Chang said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press. In addition to leading the reopening and renovation of the downtown synagogue, she was poised to get a new job.
"She was endlessly positive, just a wonderful person who was doing so much good and could bring so much happiness and joy," Chang said.
Democratic state Rep. Noah Arbit posted on Facebook he was "broken and unable to move" at the news of Woll's murder. He said she was the kindest and most beautiful soul taken away in "the most evil, brutal way.
"Sam was committed to justice and equality. In her name we will never give up. Baruch Dayan Emet, Sam. You were so loved and cherished."
Sloktin posted a tribute on her official Facebook page saying Woll sought to bring people together and cared deeply about helping others.
"Separately, in politics & in the Jewish community, she dedicated her short life to building understanding across faiths, bringing light in the face of darkness," the congresswoman wrote.
Woll will be missed, Sloktin wrote, for her desire to serve and the bright smile she brought across the Detroit area.
“I am shocked, saddened and horrified to learn of Sam’s brutal murder,” Nessel said in a statement posted on X. “Sam was as kind a person as I’ve ever known. She was driven by her sincere love of her community, state and country. Sam truly used her faith and activism to create a better place for everyone.”
Woll, who previously worked in constituent relations for Chang, was selected as one of The Detroit Jewish News' "36 under 36" in 2017.
According to the outlet, Woll helped lead the American Jewish Committee’s ACCESS Detroit Young Leadership Program and founded the Muslim-Jewish Forum of Detroit, a grassroots organization aimed to build relationships between young adults of those faiths.
"By extending her hand and creating space for connection between Muslims and Jews, she has exemplified the values of healing the world," The Detroit Jewish News article said.
CORALVILLE — U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, standing on the bed of a bright red truck, delivered a passionate defense of her votes opposing U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan's bid for House speaker — a high-profile break from the majority of House Republicans that she said spawned death threats against her.
“I am never going to quit fighting for Iowa, and I am never going to quit fighting for this country," Miller-Meeks yelled at her annual fundraiser event Friday night. "So if you think you can intimidate me, go … suck it up, buttercup!"
Washington, D.C., was gridlocked this week as House Republicans failed to elect a new speaker. The caucus nominated Jordan, an ultraconservative representative from Ohio.
In the first round of votes, Miller-Meeks and the other three members in Iowa's delegation cast their votes for Jordan — but holdouts from 20 Republicans tanked Jordan's bid. Miller-Meeks explained Friday that she voted to Jordan out of respect for a House rule that members vote on the floor for whoever gets the majority vote in a closed-door conference.
But, she told reporters, she had concerns about whether Jordan could unify the party, and she was worried about the looming threat of a government shutdown.
"I wanted assurances that Republican members of Congress were not going to be attacking other Republicans," Miller-Meeks said. "As soon as the vote was had in conference, and then, not two hours later, we had that coming out."
In the second round of votes on Wednesday, Miller-Meeks withdrew her support for Jordan. She cast her vote Wednesday for U.S. Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, a Republican who chairs the Appropriations Committee.
"Since my vote in support of Chairwoman Granger, I have received credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls," Miller-Meeks said in a statement Wednesday night. "The proper authorities have been notified and my office is cooperating fully."
On Friday, Jordan lost a third floor vote for speaker, with Iowa's delegation voting for him except for Miller-Meeks. Jordan then lost a secret ballot and withdrew his nomination.
Miller-Meeks did not mention the death threats specifically during her speech Friday, but she delivered a passionate defense of her Congressional record.
“I’m not a Democrat. I am a proud Republican," Miller-Meeks said. "Why do I want to get appropriations bills across? … It’s because every one of those appropriations bills has Republican priorities and Republican policies."
Miller-Meeks thanked her office staff for dealing with a "very stressful week." She anticipates House Republicans will successfully choose a speaker "next week."
"We had a vote for speaker, and then I had to rush here to make my own tailgate. And so, there are candidates who have thrown their name into the ring," Miller-Meeks told reporters. "I have told everybody I’m not doing anything until Sunday."

Trying to squeeze every last drop of life out of your smartphone? It’s one thing to deal with a battery that doesn’t last a day and crashing apps to avoid spending a big chunk of change.
But using your phone past its end of life is risky business. So is clicking any link that comes your way. It's a bummer hackers are weaving them into artificial intelligence chatbot results.
Let’s look at one of the easiest ways to keep your digital life safer: Only using devices that get current security updates.

The lifespan lowdown
Today, the average lifespan of smartphones is around 2.5 years. It could be even less for some devices – between 15 and 18 months. That’s not much when phones cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
Bigger brands like Apple and Samsung tend to have longer lifespans than smaller companies. Here are the average lifespans for some of today’s most popular phones:
◾ iPhone – 4 to 8 years
◾ Samsung – 3 to 6 years
◾ Google Pixel – 3 to 5 years
◾ Huawei – 2 to 4 years
These are averages, meaning your mileage may vary.
Find your number
Your phone’s lifespan clock starts from when it was made, not when you purchased it. That makes keeping track of all this a little tricky. If you’re unsure when your phone was made, you can find out with some sleuthing.
◾ Do you have the phone’s original box? The manufacture date should be listed on the package or in any included documentation.
◾ If you tossed the box, the information should be listed within your phone’s settings under “About” or a similar option.
◾ You can also use your phone’s serial number to decipher when it was made. Many manufacturers hide the date or year within these numbers. The serial number is tucked in your phone’s settings.
◾ There are special dial codes and boot logging menus, too, that can show you this info.
Are your eyes glazing over? I thought so.
There’s an easier way
Instead of doing all the steps above, a great place to check your phone’s end of life, or EOL for short, is dropping by the site end of life.date.
This straightforward site lists EOL dates and lifecycles for devices, software programs and more. It tracks 261 products and has an iCal integration, so you can get a reminder that you need to upgrade something.
At the very top, there’s a search box. Type your make and model in there, and presto, the info you need is right on the screen. Or choose from the four major manufacturers listed in the Devices row. If you can’t find your phone there, scroll through the complete list of products and manufacturers in the left-hand menu.
When you click on a manufacturer, its phones are listed chronologically. You can view each phone’s release date, when it was discontinued and if the manufacturer still supports it.
This is serious stuff
Using a phone past its EOL data spells trouble. That’s you if you’re still using an iPhone 5C, Google Pixel 5, or Samsung S10S – among many others.
You won’t get the latest and greatest features and advancements, but that’s not the biggest issue.
Once a smartphone reaches its expiration, the manufacturer no longer pushes security updates to that device. This means any bugs and security problems in your phone will go unfixed.
An outdated phone is a gold mine for hackers, who could quickly access everything from your bank accounts and company information to your health data. They could even steal your voice through audio data from phone calls and voicemails.
Do yourself a favor and make sure your phone is safe and secure. If not, it’s time to start shopping!

When you're messaging someone, you don't want to overload them with information. Sometimes, sending a lengthy paragraph can feel like too much. You also may want to avoid the dreaded "double text," or in some cases, triple or quadruple text.
This is where slang and abbreviations come in to help. There is a whole library of examples at your fingertips – from "ily" and "rizz" to "OP" and "fwiw."
"ICYMI", USA TODAY has been breaking down text slang. Now, it's time to learn a new one. Here is the meaning and how to use "fyi."
"FYI" stands for "for your information." When used, the term notifies others about something that is important or significant.
The abbreviation can be used in both formal and informal messaging, such as via email to relay a deadline at work or while texting a friend about some interesting gossip.
The usage of "FYI" can be traced back to the 1930s when it was used by journalists to denote that the messages – or parts of the messages – they sent were for the recipient only, not for public viewing, according to Grammarly.
Here are some examples of how to use "fyi":

A grocery store in Petersburg, Alaska had an unexpected customer Tuesday, leaving store employees and other shoppers in shock.
A black bear cub was spotted roaming the produce aisle at the Petersburg's Trading Union IGA, scaring customers, Alaska News Source reported.
Alaska State Troopers, two wildlife troopers and units from the Petersburg Police Department were called to the scene, where officers chased the cub through the aisles of fruits and vegetables with a steel catch pole, video footage from the incident shows. After some struggle, authorities were able to corner and catch the young cub where the shopping carts are stored.
The black bear was escorted out and loaded into the back of a trooper vehicle, after a lot of fuss and protest.

The bear cub unfortunately had to be euthanized, Justin Freeman, a public information officer with the Alaska State Troopers told USA TODAY.
Freeman said that the decision was made in coordination with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game for a variety of reasons.
"The bear was small and emaciated for this time of year," explained Freeman. "It did not have any measure of fat that would have sustained it through the winter. It was also abandoned, for unknown reasons, and therefore did not have any way to significantly acquire resources to recover from its condition."
The spokesperson further said that the bear would not likely be able to handle the stress of transportation to a holding facility, and no known facilities had placement for a black bear.

Meet Nanny McPhee, the British cat with two noses up for adoption across the pond.
Nanny, a 4-year-old black and white 'moggy' with a tan streak on her face and big hazel cat eyes is a rare breed. Or so the animal rescue sheltering her posted on social media Thursday.
One could guess, crafty shelter folks abroad named her after the fictional character Nanny McPhee, played by Actress Emma Thompson in the 2005 British self-titled film, Nanny McPhee, about a governess who "uses magic to rein in the behavior of seven ne'er-do-well children in her charge."
And has a very large noggin.

Nanny's double nose was caused by "a rare congenital abnormality," Cats Protection Warrington Adoption Centre in the United Kingdom posted on Facebook.
According to the World Health Organization, the disorders, also called birth defects, are structural or functional abnormalities present from birth in both humans and animals.
Although WHO said the disorders can contribute to long-term disability. the feline "thankfully has no long-term ill effects," the shelter said.
"Nanny McPhee is a gentle lady who loves fuss and a cuddle," the adoption center wrote.

Animal encounters can be magical, and at an aquarium in Gulfport, Mississippi, an adorable toddler had the experience of a lifetime when a baby dolphin stopped to chat.
Dolphins are said to be the most intelligent animals on the planet after humans. They're also extremely social. So, when Ryenn ran up to the glass to wave, the curious dolphin not only noticed the child but came over to share what looked like a real conversation.
Later, Ryenn's mom, Carly Keech, who filmed the encounter, said it "unlocked a new core memory" for her daughter.

A Southwest Airlines cabin crew family reunion, a sweet toddler meeting his newborn baby sister for the first time, and a pair of rambunctious grandma BFFs topped our Humankind stories of the week.
During a Southwest Airlines flight from Dallas, Texas, the pilot took a moment to inform passengers about a very special cabin crew on board. Air hostess Angel had been working for Southwest for 27 years. Now, for the first time, she was joined by her two daughters, Keleko and Jessica, on their first day at work with the airline. But that's not all– their father Gregg, a retired flight captain, was on board too!
In Sunset Beach, North Carolina, an 89-year-old grandma named Angela Timmerman was sitting in her room when she was startled by a surprise visitor — her best friend of over 60 years. 84-year-old Joann Flynn, who'd moved away to Newtown, Connecticut, had traveled back to see her. If that isn't a bestie, we don't know what is. Watch a surprise on a Southwest flight, a toddler meeting his baby sister, a sweet father-son driving lesson, and more on the week's Best of Humankind.
When two-year-old Matteo Clarke entered the hospital room where his newborn sister lay, he was in a hurry to see her. "Where's my sister?" he asked immediately as his mom greeted him. When Matteo finally got to see and hold the baby in his arms, his excitement at meeting his new best friend was palpable.
In Treemonton, Utah, 11-year-old Ezekial Zarate shared a priceless father-son moment with his dad. Spotting an empty lot on the way to work, Michael Zarate decided it was the perfect spot to teach his son how to drive. So, with his father in the passenger seat, Ezekial took the wheel. And the core memory is surely something the 11-year-old will never forget.
Finally, in the UK, Phil Garner found a bedraggled duck named Freda at a local fishing pond. After taking the bird home, Phil and his wife Julia nursed her back to full strength. Freda stayed with them for 18 months, then mysteriously disappeared. But eventually, the prodigal duck returned home with a new boyfriend and 11 ducklings in tow! Now Phil, Julia, Freda, and her brood are one big happy family.
WASHINGTON – After House Republicans voted to drop Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, as their speaker nominee, a mad dash for the top job has started within the deeply divided House Republican conference.
After voting to abandon Jordan as their nominee by a vote of 112-86, GOP lawmakers are headed home for the weekend to recuperate after a chaotic series of events on Capitol Hill. In the meantime, some Republicans have immediately declared their candidacy with others still considering a run.
House Republicans will hear from prospective speakers when they return to Washington for a candidate forum at 6:30 p.m. Monday.
The earliest the House could elect a new speaker is Tuesday.
Here's who is running for speaker or seriously considering a run.
House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., began making calls to run for speaker after Jordan's exit from the race, according to a source familiar.
As whip, Emmer is the No. 3 ranking House Republican. Ousted former speaker Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., endorsed the Minnesota Republican for the speakership in a huge boost for Emmer's candidacy. McCarthy still commands the respect of the vast majority of the House Republican conference.
"He is the right person for the job. He can unite the conference. He understands the dynamics of the conference. He also understands what it takes to win and keep a majority," McCarthy said to Punchbowl News.
Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., was one of the first candidates who jumped into the speaker's race, immediately announcing his candidacy to reporters after House Republicans dropped Jordan as their nominee.
"We need a different type of leader who has a proven track record of success, which is why I'm running for Speaker of the House," Hern said in a statement.
The Oklahoma Republican is chair of the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of around 170 GOP lawmakers making it the largest group of House Republicans.
Earlier this month, Hern made calls to every single House Republican to gauge support for an earlier run but ultimately decided against it, declining to run against previous speaker nominees Jordan and House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La.
Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., was a little-known lawmaker until earlier this month when he launched a surprise challenge to Jordan's speakership bid as a protest candidate against the conservative firebrand.
Scott ran against Jordan in an internal vote within the House Republican conference to select a nominee. Scott lost the nomination by a vote of 124-81. The Georgia Republican rallied behind Jordan after his loss but Jordan's exit, Scott immediately jumped back in the race.
"There's a lot of people that appreciated what we did," Scott told USA TODAY about his first speaker campaign.
Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, is running for speaker according to a spokesperson from his office.
Donalds has played a large role in key negotiations between moderate and ultraconservative GOP lawmakers. During Jordan's failed speaker elections, some GOP holdouts voted for Donalds as a protest candidate.
As it slowly became clear Jordan could not earn the support he needed in his quest for the speakership before he was dropped as the nominee, Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., considered issuing a challenge to the Ohio Republican but did not follow through.
With Jordan out however, Bergman immediately jumped in the race announcing his candidacy.
"My hat is in the ring, and I feel confident I can win the votes where others could not. I have no special interests to serve; I’m only in this to do what's best for our Nation and to steady the ship for the 118th Congress," Bergman said in a statement.
Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, chair of the House Budget Committee, told reporters he is "seriously considering" running for speaker.
Arrington's name has been floated by several lawmakers as an alternative candidate during Jordan's candidacy but the lawmaker fell behind the Ohio Republicans' speakership bid at the time.
Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., vice chair of the House Republican conference, is currently making calls considering a run for speaker.
“Rep. Johnson is calling his colleagues regarding a run for Speaker," Corinne Day, a spokesperson for Johnson said.
Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, also launched a bid for speaker immediately following Jordan's exit.
"Congressman Sessions believes he can forge a positive path as a conservative leader who can unite the Conference," Sessions' office said in a statement.
Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., has also said he's considering a bid for the speakership.
"Should I decide to run for Speaker, my message will be focused on politics of inclusion," Meuser shared on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. "
"Every Member of the Republican Conference needs to be a part of policy making, legislation, and communications. That feeling of ownership builds a team culture, which is needed as we move our party forward," he added.

One of the main reasons I was offered this opportunity was that no one else wanted to do it.
It was April 2020. The pandemic had just started, and all of a sudden, I was considered an “essential worker” being asked to travel the country. Normally, the idea of traveling sparks images of exploring fun restaurants and unique places, meeting up with friends or family, or getting to know new people – none of this was even an option. Most businesses were closed. The idea of even booking a hotel was difficult because every city, county, and state had different regulations as to who was allowed to be there. Everyone I knew was staying at home and enjoying a small circle of people to quarantine with while I was getting to leave the house and experience new places.
I thought I had beat the system!
Making my way up the coast was breathtakingly beautiful. I had wrapped up my work in California and was driving up the Pacific Coast Highway, with a pit stop at Redwoods National Park planned the next day on the way to Oregon. The night was getting late, and I needed to find a spot to sleep, so I booked a hotel on my phone and pulled into the small military town of Fort Bragg. I grabbed my bag and, half asleep, wandered into the hotel to check-in.

“Checking in?” the guy at the motel asked. 
“Yes, I have a reservation.” I handed him my ID. 
“Are you working in town?” 
“Yes sir, I just finished and am on my way north.”
“I need proof that you have a job in town, or unfortunately, you won’t be allowed to stay here,” he said. 
“I did have a job. I finished it before checking in,” I explained, showing him my work order. 
“Unfortunately, if you don’t have work here tomorrow, it would be against the law for you to stay here.” I was sent away. Mendocino County did not want me to stay the night, apparently, so I had to sleep in my car tucked off of the highway instead.

I was completely alone and isolated. The excitement of traveling was quickly wearing off.
That rip current sign was in my head again. It said, “If you need help, yell or wave for assistance.” Only spending time with myself was going to be the greatest challenge I had ever faced. Most people have family and friends surrounding them in these moments of life transition. Everyone I knew was miles and miles away, self-isolating with their loved ones. 
Making my way north through Portland and Seattle, I discovered that artists in nearly every city put murals up on the plywood that businesses used to board up their buildings. Everywhere I went, there were more plywood murals, and I started taking photos of them in every city. It gave me something to take my mind off of having to be my own best friend and attempting to enjoy my own company. 
The pandemic made so many great cities look like empty, post-apocalyptic shells of themselves. They were depressed, empty, and dangerous. They looked like how I felt inside. As society was going through a difficult transition, so was I. But these murals were something else, a sign of hope. I began to see them as a sign that even in moments of transition, we can still make the best of things and create something beautiful.
My creativity had long been in hibernation. I had bought a camera a few years prior in an attempt to share a hobby with my wife, who was always setting up elaborate photoshoots. I didn't even really know how to use my camera, but I began experimenting, walking around these abandoned cities and capturing this historical moment in time. I couldn’t help but wonder if these cities would ever return to their former glory.
Would they be better than they were before? Was there a chance that everything, including my life, would be better in the future? 
This is an excerpt from “Going Places: Soul-Stirring Essays About the Travel That Changed Us,” published on Sept. 22 by Sulit Press. Author Jason Fuerstenberg has been an independent travel writer and photographer for over five years based out of California.
CORALVILLE — U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, standing on the bed of a bright red truck, delivered a passionate defense of her votes opposing U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan's bid for House speaker — a high-profile break from the majority of House Republicans that she said spawned death threats against her.
“I am never going to quit fighting for Iowa, and I am never going to quit fighting for this country," Miller-Meeks yelled at her annual fundraiser event Friday night. "So if you think you can intimidate me, go … suck it up, buttercup!"
Washington, D.C., was gridlocked this week as House Republicans failed to elect a new speaker. The caucus nominated Jordan, an ultraconservative representative from Ohio.
In the first round of votes, Miller-Meeks and the other three members in Iowa's delegation cast their votes for Jordan — but holdouts from 20 Republicans tanked Jordan's bid. Miller-Meeks explained Friday that she voted to Jordan out of respect for a House rule that members vote on the floor for whoever gets the majority vote in a closed-door conference.
But, she told reporters, she had concerns about whether Jordan could unify the party, and she was worried about the looming threat of a government shutdown.
"I wanted assurances that Republican members of Congress were not going to be attacking other Republicans," Miller-Meeks said. "As soon as the vote was had in conference, and then, not two hours later, we had that coming out."
In the second round of votes on Wednesday, Miller-Meeks withdrew her support for Jordan. She cast her vote Wednesday for U.S. Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, a Republican who chairs the Appropriations Committee.
"Since my vote in support of Chairwoman Granger, I have received credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls," Miller-Meeks said in a statement Wednesday night. "The proper authorities have been notified and my office is cooperating fully."
On Friday, Jordan lost a third floor vote for speaker, with Iowa's delegation voting for him except for Miller-Meeks. Jordan then lost a secret ballot and withdrew his nomination.
Miller-Meeks did not mention the death threats specifically during her speech Friday, but she delivered a passionate defense of her Congressional record.
“I’m not a Democrat. I am a proud Republican," Miller-Meeks said. "Why do I want to get appropriations bills across? … It’s because every one of those appropriations bills has Republican priorities and Republican policies."
Miller-Meeks thanked her office staff for dealing with a "very stressful week." She anticipates House Republicans will successfully choose a speaker "next week."
"We had a vote for speaker, and then I had to rush here to make my own tailgate. And so, there are candidates who have thrown their name into the ring," Miller-Meeks told reporters. "I have told everybody I’m not doing anything until Sunday."

Imagine a young married couple. One partner invests heavily in his employer’s 401(k), saving for both spouses. The other focuses on paying the bills and contributes nothing to her retirement plan, missing out on the employer's matching funds.
That was how Niv Persaud and her husband handled their finances.
“My income was going toward our expenses, and he was going to focus on retirement,” she said. “And I had a great company match, and I didn’t pay attention to that.”
The marriage eventually ended. Three decades later, Persaud works as a certified financial planner in Atlanta. Her lost retirement savings provide a cautionary tale.
How much potential savings did she lose?

“I don’t even want to think about it,” she said.
In fact, one in four married couples fails to take full advantage of employers who make matching contributions to 401(k) retirement plans, a recent study found. The oversight costs them nearly $700 a year, on average.
Nearly two-thirds of American workers have access to an employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement savings plan, according to the paper, titled “Efficiency in Household Decision Making: Evidence from the Retirement Savings of U.S. Couples,” and released in April by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Most plans offer a match: The employer contributes to a 401(k), matching some or all of the funds paid into the plan by the worker. In one typical model, the employer matches half of every dollar a worker contributes, up to a maximum of 6% of the worker’s pay.
The study found that about 24% of married couples left money on the table by failing to claim some of an employer’s matching funds. Those couples lost $682 a year, on average, money they could recover simply by changing the allocation of their retirement contributions. The findings are based on IRS tax data and retirement plan descriptions.
“There’s a lot of advice around, ‘You should save more,’” said Taha Choukhmane, an assistant professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. “It’s not just how much you save. It’s how you save, and where you save.”
Choukhmane co-authored the working paper with Cormac O’Dea, an assistant professor of economics at Yale, and Lucas Goodman, an economist at the Treasury Department.
The researchers stressed that their focus was not on couples that don’t save for retirement, or don’t save enough. Instead, they looked at couples that could increase their savings merely by shifting contributions from one spouse to the other.
“You don’t need to save more. You don’t need to change how you spend,” Choukhmane said. “It’s all about how you allocate money across accounts.”
In some couples, the researchers found, only one spouse contributed to a retirement plan, while the other ignored a plan with a generous employer match. Other couples split retirement savings equally when they should have put more money into an account with a larger match.
“The 401(k) is really designed around individuals,” Choukhmane said. “And I think a lot of people need to realize that this is not about the individual.”
The new study underscores a lack of cooperation between spouses on an important matter of household finance. The researchers said it also speaks to the broader issue of financial communication in marriage.
“It does open up a question of what other big decisions couples are not coordinating on,” O’Dea, the assistant professor at Yale, said.
The researchers found that couples that had been married longer, and couples with children, tended to do a better job at communicating and coordinating retirement savings. Couples in shorter relationships did worse.
Couples headed for divorce were also less likely to coordinate their retirement contributions. The researchers discovered this by studying the saving patterns of marriages that ended in divorce.
Investment advisers often recommend that American workers save 10% to 15% of their pre-tax income for retirement. They also urge them to max out any matching funds from the employer, which boosts the worker’s effective savings rate.
If a company matches up to 6% of your salary in 401(k) contributions, "maxing out" means contributing at least that much of your annual pay.
“The first priority for any investor should be to save enough to get at least the entire employer match,” said Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at Charles Schwab.
Yet, many partners leave the money untapped. Vanguard, for example, reports that 31% of its retirement plan participants failed to claim some or all of an employer’s matching funds in 2022.
Retirement savings rates are lower for younger workers, whose retirement falls in the more distant future. Among Vanguard participants, the retirement savings rate in 2022 ranged from 5.2% for workers under 25 to 9% for those over 65.
Many Americans of all ages have struggled to save in the last two years when inflation reached a 40-year high.
More on inflation's bite:High costs disrupt life in more ways than we can see
In the 2023 Retirement Confidence Survey, conducted by the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute, 84% of workers voiced concern that the rising cost of living will make it harder for them to save money for retirement.
An employer match may not seem like much money.
“People look at it and say, ‘It’s only 3%,’” said James Gambaccini, a certified financial planner in Reston, Virginia. But “it’s a 100% match up to 3% of your salary.”
The formula Gambaccini describes, matching the employee’s full retirement contribution up to 3% of their pay, would double a 3% contribution to 6% without the worker spending another dollar. An employee with a $50,000 salary would see a $1,500 contribution grow to $3,000.
“Football belongs to everybody.”
Think about those words and what they mean to you. They probably tell you how much the American version of the sport captivates the country every weekend of the fall.
But consider the source of these words: They’re from a woman, a former Division I athlete but one who never really got a chance to play football.
When Karissa Niehoff sees what’s going on now with the game and its opportunities for girls, her mind goes back to when she was a senior in high school.
“We played Powderpuff against our archrival team, the archrival town and it was essentially a flag situation,” said Niehoff, now the CEO of the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). “But that’s all we had.”
It wasn’t much, a game played by girls as a kind of afterthought to the “real thing” the boys played. Several decades later, though, amid a broader national picture of equity, it’s a sport girls are making distinctly their own.  
Flag football has become one of the hottest and fastest growing sports for kids to play For girls specifically, though, it’s one they have seized with a national wave of enthusiasm.
Already soaring in popularity at the youth levels, girls flag football has achieved high school varsity status in eight states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida Georgia, New York and Nevada) as either a fall or spring sport and 18 more states have pilot programs that could achieve that status soon. There are 15,000-plus girls playing flag football at more than 700 high schools, according to the NFHS.
It's a sport we learned last week will be offered for men and women at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games and one the NFL is supporting with youth initiatives and grant programs to assist states in starting programs at schools.
“The collaboration behind the growth of flag is something we have never seen or been a part of to this degree,” Niehoff told USA TODAY Sports in a phone interview last week. “In terms of the pace of growth, I’d be hard-pressed to say that anything has grown as quickly as flag.
“I’ve just always loved football,” she says, “and I think they’re a lot of women and girls that love football. And so I think an opportunity for them to enter into the sport with a more equitable kind of physical prowess, playing field is really exciting.”
It's also just fun. What is the allure behind this vibrant girls sport that is sweeping America? USA TODAY Sports takes a closer look:
“We’re representing our school!”
“We’re representing our family!”
“Most of all, we’re representing each other!”
That cheer was captured by a CBS report about a local high school flag football team in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Girls across the country are playing a sport they previously only watched their brothers play. On this team, though, there are two girls who watched their dad play. You may have heard of him – Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young. He’s now an assistant coach for their team at Menlo School.
Young’s two sons never played football, but daughters Summer and Laila dove in head first at the chance.
“I wanted to do what my dad did and feel what he felt when he was doing this sport,” says Laila, a wide receiver.
Likewise, coaches like Young nationwide are seeing girls experience those “Ah-ha!” moments we all cherish when they throw a spiral, line up for a formation or correctly follow a snap count for the first time.
“They go on four, no one flinched,” Young said in a local TV interview. “And I was like, ‘IT took me 15 years to go on 2. We’d remind ourselves the whole way to the line of scrimmage, ‘It’s two, it’s two,’ and we’d still go offsides. And they get it in 15 seconds.”
Girls are feeling it, and loving it, taking a game with which most of us are familiar and carving it into something distinctly their own.
“I just had a phone call with a gentleman that coaches in North Carolina,” Niehoff told USA TODAY Sports. “Having been a coach of multiple girls sports and teams over the years, he said, ‘When I’ve coached boys, they support one another, of course, but the girls cheer for one another even in practice.’ When somebody does a really good execution of a play or learns a skill, he said, ‘I really like how the girls engage in the camaraderie and the support really overtly.’ ”
COACH STEVE: Sports parents, you're out of control; behave or get off the sideline
Flag is football with no hitting, even in a football-crazed state in Alabama. (“NON-CONTACT SPORT,” it says in the state’s rules listed online.) It’s a sport kids can play (and parents can watch) without worrying about being leveled.
But that doesn’t mean they’re not playing football. Down the California coast from Young in San Diego, Drew Brees is an assistant coach with the Santa Fe Christian high school’s girls flag team. Brees, another famed NFL quarterback who retired after the 2020 season, is at the forefront of the flag movement, co-founding the Football ’N’ America youth leagues in 2017 in New Orleans while he still played for the Saints.
He didn’t put on pads until he played tackle football in high school. He learned football’s fundamentals playing flag, a game of strategy and precision.
As they juke and cut through defenders who swipe for their flags, girls are discovering crucial components of football that aren’t always emphasized in a game built on a reputation of being rough.
“The games that we don’t win, we aren’t playing together as a team,” Avery Brewster, a senior co-captain on Mission Viejo’s high school team in California, told USA TODAY Sports. “Sometimes I’ve noticed in tackle football, it’s just like a receiver throwing to one person (and) sometimes it can work because that person’s stronger but with us, with flag football, because we’re not tackling and we’re pulling flags, we have to play together as team.
“If we all don’t run our routes correctly, because there’s no one blocking us, then that leaves our quarterback stranded because nobody’s open. But when we work together as a team, there’s always somebody that’s open when we run our routes correctly and we play better. And the chemistry is there.”
COACH STEVE: Think you're a good sports parent? Coach for Tom Brady, Drew Brees has radical advice for you
Flag football delves deeply into a component of football we see every time we watch a video of a coach handing out a game ball. The players are gathered around as they are called out for their contributions to the game and the coach’s shoutouts are followed by hoots and hollers.
A 2018 study on teen sport in America by the Women’s Sports Foundation found that boys who participated in full-contact football had some of the highest self-esteems among youth sports participants. It’s a game where youth and high school rosters can go more than 50 deep and yet have each player make a unique contribution and feel a part of the team.
Michele LaBotz, medical director of the athletic training program at the University of New England, cited the study at a media briefing last week hosted by the National Athletic Trainers’ Association. Labotz, though, sees something else at play, too.
“It’ll be interesting to see how this carries over to flag football but (football is) one of the few sports that is really welcoming to the child and adolescent who’s carrying extra weight, especially those that are carrying quite a bit of extra weight who really struggle with finding other opportunities for sport participation,” she says, “and football sometimes is the only option that they have.”
Half of the girls playing flag football in high schools across American, according to the NFSA, weren't even participating in other high school sports before this one came along. 
Yes, flag football players already have role models they can emulate like Mexico quarterback Diana Flores, who was featured in a commercial at the last Super Bowl in which she evades a dizzying number of defenders, including broadcaster Erin Andrews and her mother.
But they can also admire the girl next to them who, like them, is trying something new. 
“I just think it’s really cool that they have the opportunity to do this and feel included and feel not alone in everything,” says Katie Neilson, another senior co-captain on Mission Viejo’s team in California who has only been playing the sport since her sophomore year. “We’ve all gotten really close with our teammates and it’s really cool to see girls come out of their comfort zone and feel comfortable around us.”
In California, where girls flag is being offered as a varsity sport for the first time this fall, more than 400 schools are participating in it.
Emmy Walton got a sense of the sport’s soaring popularity when she and her organization, Women of Will (WoW), helped host a tournament at Mission Viejo High last month. The event drew 21 schools from four sports hotbeds in the southern part of the state: Los Angeles County, Orange County, the Inland Empire and San Diego.
 “I would have been all over flag football if it was an option for me,” says Walton, a four-year varsity soccer player at Cal State Fullerton and the national account manager for Women of Will.
Women of Will, which partners with apparel and equipment outfits BSN Sports and Under Armour, is a unique, girls-only sports high school sponsorship program. It promotes women’s identities as female athletes as part of a nationwide network that has reached 300-plus schools in almost every stae.
WoW celebrates women's sports through uniform designs but also hypes the players who wear them, hosting days at high schools where girls teams are championed like boys football on homecoming.
“When we grew up, there wasn’t even girls athletic wear,” Walton says. “There wasn’t girls soccer shirts. It was all just like boys, and it was all baggy and everything. Luckily, we’ve got a big highlight and spotlight on females in sport now and we’ve got amazing gear that actually fits our bodies. …
“Part of the Women of Will program is trying to help build female programs, female teams, getting more girls to try out, especially after COVID, (when) we saw a huge decline in sport participation. ... I can’t imagine not having the experiences and the life lessons I learned from playing sports.
“We want to give them something that will leave a legacy of empowering female athletes in creating a culture change on campus of these ladies having a safe space to rise up as leaders.”
It’s been about 20 years since Walton played prep sports. When she walks around a high school campus these days, she gets a much different picture than the one once saw through teenaged eyes.
Students pass her with their heads down or their ears plugged with wireless earpieces. Some of them don’t talk even to the people they pass and see.
Then Walton goes out to the athletic fields or into the gymnasiums. There, the communication is as vibrant as ever. She sees girls like she once was with sense of direction, spirit and purpose. She sees something else, too.
They’re playing football.
“These girls can be pioneers,” she says. “I hope that colleges are seeing how fast this sport is growing and how important it is to offer it.”
With each passing year, Niehoff, the NFHS’ CEO, guesses two to four states will sanction girls flag as a varsity sport. NAIA schools and junior colleges are already offering scholarships for it. Niehoff fully expects the sport to become a Division 1 opportunity to women down the road.
“I think what flag will do for the football in general is have better conversations at the dinner table when Mom or Dad has their child say, ‘I want to play football,’ ” she says. “By getting kids excited about flag, they get excited about football … We’re getting families to embrace the sport of football with a different lens.”
After all, as she knows, football belongs to everybody.

The best advice you can give a college coach is to change jobs every seven or eight years, if they’re lucky enough to make it that long. It doesn’t apply in every case, of course. There’s a separate category for coaches who win national championships, though they aren’t necessarily immune either. Coaches who regularly punch above their weight at programs that don't expect titles might have it best of all in this business because they can usually stay as long as they want. 
But if you're at a top-shelf place and you’re good but constantly falling short of the ultimate goal in the same way over and over again, you’re always on a timer. Even if the school doesn’t really want to fire you, the fans eventually tire of you. And even with all the money being deposited in your bank account, it’s not the best quality of life. 
Meet James Franklin, the coach at Penn State. He’s had some good stretches. He’s had a few down periods. But mainly, he’s just kind of achieved at the same level for 10 years. And that level isn’t Ohio State or Michigan's level, which means the Nittany Lions have been cut out of the College Football Playoff picture because of two teams they play every year. 
Is that good enough? Penn State needs to beat those teams now and then. And Saturday seemed like a good chance, with Ohio State somewhat diminished from the offensive monster they were the last few years and Penn State sporting the best defense it’s had under Franklin. This year might have been as even as the overall talent has ever been. 
And for all that, Franklin’s team didn’t even really show up. Yeah, they were in the game into the fourth quarter. But they didn’t play well at all offensively, gaining just 240 yards with 49 rushing yards on 26 attempts.
In the end, it was a 20-12 loss with a garbage time touchdown making it look more respectable, dropping Franklin to 1-9 against Ohio State. He’s fared better against Michigan (3-6), but the Wolverines weren’t a top-10 team in those three good years.

In other words, the overall picture is more or less the same for Penn State as it was six or seven years ago once Franklin got the program rolling. Whether they’re right or wrong, how long until the people at Penn State just want something … different? 
The romance in college football is often in the hope and the unknown, but that’s gone at Penn State. They know what the program is and isn’t under Franklin. At this point, fans could probably predict almost word-for-word what he’s going to say at his press conference. 
And it’s all really good. But as Saturday’s performance showed, still not good enough. 
For that reason, Penn State is No. 1 in this week’s Misery Index, a weekly measurement of which fan bases are feeling the most angst about the state of their favorite program. 
In the euphoria of Sam Pittman getting the Razorbacks to 9-4 in 2021, the athletics director at Arkansas did what ADs usually do in these situations. He got hoodwinked by super agent Jimmy Sexton into giving out a big contract extension, even though Pittman was neither leaving nor being seriously pursued by anyone else. That AD’s name is Hunter Yurachek, and these days you mostly hear about him because he’s been one of the loudest voices begging for a national law regulating name, image and likeness and arguing that schools will go broke or have to cut sports if players become employees and get paid. 
But when Yurachek has to fire his football coach -- which might be this year -- you won't hear him cry poor or threaten to pull money from women’s volleyball or men’s golf. He’ll just go find the money because that’s what these ADs do. And it’ll be a lot of money — either $16.1 million or $10.7 million, which is an interesting story on its own.
The contract stipulated that Pittman got an extra year if he won seven games at any point in the deal, which was accomplished last season when the Razorbacks went 7-6. But if his overall record dipped from the beginning of 2021 dipped below .500 it would be a smaller buyout.
After a 7-3 loss to Mississippi State — Arkansas’ sixth in a row and 10th in its last 12 SEC games — Pittman’s record since 2021 is 18-16. If the Hogs lose their next two to Florida and Auburn, he’ll be right at .500 heading into a Nov. 18 game against…Florida International. 
It’s all funny money these days in college football, but the idea that a game against FIU could be worth $5.4 million to Pittman personally and to Arkansas’ budget is maybe the only funny thing about this disaster of a Razorbacks season. 
One of many schools that got tricked into thinking they really had something going during the bizarro pandemic season of 2020, the Hoosiers rewarded coach Tom Allen with a way-too-friendly contract in March of 2021. Now, 2 1/2 seasons and a measly eight total wins later, Indiana would be on the hook for a $20 million buyout if they want to get rid of him. 
And they probably need to after dropping to 2-5 overall and 0-4 in the Big Ten with a 31-14 loss to Rutgers. 
Hey, Indiana fans had reason to be excited back then. Indiana wasn’t a one-hit COVID wonder, but it was a two-hit wonder under Allen. In 2019, when the Hoosiers went 8-5, their offensive coordinator was Kalen DeBoer, who has worked wonders at Fresno State and now Washington. Their defensive coordinator was Kane Wommack, an up-and-comer who is winning big at South Alabama. By 2021, both were gone — as is quarterback Michael Penix who tore it up in 2020, suffered from multiple injuries and ultimately followed DeBoer to the Huskies, where he is now the Heisman Trophy favorite.
So while Allen obviously had something to do with the success, he totally owns the failure that has followed. Indiana is a football program used to going back to square one every few years. It seems they're about to find themselves back in the same spot. 
Here’s the state of things currently in East Lansing. On the night they lost at home 49-0 to their most hated rival with an interim coach who is in place because their old coach admitted to masturbating on the phone with a university vendor who subsequently filed a sexual harassment complaint, somehow the only thing anyone will remember about this game is Adolf Hitler. We shouldn’t have to explain why it’s bad to have an image of a smiling Hitler on your scoreboard as part of your pre-game entertainment, regardless of context. (It was a trivia question that the university apologized for and blamed on poor oversight of a third-party vendor.) But how did that one slip past the game operations people? Or, as soon as somebody saw anything involving Hitler on the scoreboard, how did someone not just reach as quickly as possible for the button to turn it off? But however it happened, unspeakable embarrassment keeps coming for the Spartans. 
It’s very hard to get to the national championship game. It’s almost as hard to throw away most of that goodwill with the fan base in a matter of 10 months. But that’s about where the Horned Frogs find themselves after a 41-3 loss at Kansas State. At 4-4 with trips to Texas Tech and Oklahoma still on the schedule along with home games against Texas and Baylor, it will be a high-wire act for Sonny Dykes to get this very mediocre team to 6-6. TCU was obviously an excellent team last year with Max Duggan at quarterback, but also had a lot of good bounces go its way. If a Duggan-less TCU follows that up with a losing record, that run might be remembered as a bit of a historical fluke. 
Somehow, despite being a dog-tired football team, the Knights managed to score on a fourth-and-10 with 1:16 remaining to pull within a two-point conversion of tying Oklahoma in Norman. And then what did they do? They tried a terrible, double-pass trick play that required the ball to go seven yards behind the line of scrimmage before a right-handed receiver rolled left. Meanwhile, UCF had nobody on the right side of the field to draw the defense. Oklahoma sniffed it out easily and the second pass was actually never attempted. Welcome to the Gus Malzahn experience, UCF fans. And remarkably, it dropped UCF to 0-for-3 on two-point conversions this year — all on plays with some level of trickery. For a team that's third in the country in rushing this year, that's not just bizarre, it’s almost inexcusable. But for the 3-4 Knights, that’s kind of what you get sometimes with the Gus Bus.
Shane Beamer had an unexpectedly fun first two years with the Gamecocks. But he’s getting a reputation as the saltiest loser in the sport, which has already gotten old during a spiraling 2-5 season. After the season opener against North Carolina, he complained about the chain gang delaying an onside kick attempt to start the second half. Last week after blowing a 10-point lead to Florida, he kicked a Gatorate cooler and broke a bone in his foot. And even after Saturday's 34-12 loss at Missouri, he made a snide comment about the press conference room being sub-standard compared to the school's nice new facilities. Is this stuff a huge deal? No. And Beamer is a nice guy, but he spends a lot of time apologizing for stuff he does in the heat of the moment.
Welcome to the big time, Bearkats. And no, we don't mean Conference USA. We mean the Misery Index, and it’s well-deserved. After many years as one of the top Championship Subdivision programs with a national title just three seasons ago, you for some reason decided to leave that comfort zone and jump on the FBS train. And after a 33-27 double-overtime loss to Florida International, you now know how hard it's going to be. Sam Houston State is now 0-7 since moving up, and in an era of NIL, possible player compensation and a widening gap between the haves and have-nots, how much upside was there really for you to make this move? 
The trajectory seemed clear, from complete despair to signs of life to winning records in 2021 and 2022. But suddenly, the Pirates are back in the bad place — maybe a worse place. They’re 1-6 after a 10-7 home loss to Charlotte, which had also been struggling at 1-5 coming into the game, and the numbers are all very ugly. A bottom-10 offense nationally  coming in, the Pirates managed 127 yards against Charlotte and missed a tying 48-yard field goal with 34 seconds left. With such a passionate fan base and a highly regarded coach in Mike Houston, who won big at the lower levels including a national FCS title at James Madison, it's all very hard to figure. 
Sebastian Cook is pursuing his dream of becoming a barber. Some days, he spends up to 12 hours at the Brevard-based academy he attends. With a rule passed Wednesday by the Florida Board of Education, the 19-year-old transgender man will be barred from accessing a bathroom he feels comfortable using.
"It makes me really terrified to go to school," he said. "I am not a woman. I don't look like a woman. More women will be uncomfortable with me in their restroom when most men don't even realize I'm trans when I use the restroom."
More than 19 million Americans joined an international earthquake drill on Thursday that encouraged people to drop, cover and hold on, a planned event that happened just a day after a quake rattled northern California. 
But millions more are at risk, said Mark Benthien, global ShakeOut coordinator and outreach director for the Southern California Earthquake Center at the University of Southern California.
The chances of an earthquake somewhere around the world are 100% every day, Benthien said.
The Earth often shakes the ground across the nation and its territories. Hillsborough, North Carolina felt an earthquake on Thursday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
That North Carolina quake was one of more than 150 earthquakes of at least a 2.0 magnitude across the continental United States in 19 states over the past week. At least 34 earthquakes of a 2.5 magnitude or higher occurred in Puerto Rico, 30 in Alaska and 10 in Hawaii in the last seven days.
No. Should you prepare? Absolutely. Earthquakes can occur anywhere in the country, although they are less frequent in some places.
“People need to know and practice what to do,” said Benthien.
"We're trying to get people to be more self-sufficient, because in a big earthquake there’s not going to be help from the neighboring city," he said. “They’re going to be impacted too.”
 And when a big one occurs, it’s likely to trigger others around it.
It may seem like it, but that's because we’ve seen dramatic improvement in the quantity and quality of equipment that records seismic activity in the Earth, Benthien said. We “have the ability to record smaller and smaller earthquakes,” not just in California, but in distant locations where there aren’t any people, and even under the seafloor.
In some respects, we owe improvements in earthquake forecasting to the Cold War, Benthien said. Seismometers were established in far-flung locations across the world as the U.S., Russia and China tried to monitor whether the others were conducting underground nuclear tests. As a college student, he once worked along a fault in Siberia and Mongolia.
Apps alert phones when shaking is detected and social media also has contributed to the more frequent communication of earthquakes. “People are feeling small earthquakes and posting about it,” he said. “So it seems like there’s a lot more earthquakes happening, but it’s because there’s a lot more earthquake information happening and happening more frequently.”
It’s normal for seismic activity to temporarily increase or decrease, and neither positively indicates a large earthquake is eminent, according to the geological survey.
The earthquake risk is growing, because of increasing human and economic exposure and the number of assets being built in high earthquake hazard areas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a report earlier this year.
Although Alaska is the most seismically active state in the U.S., the risks and potential impacts are greater in California because it has the highest estimated potential loss due to earthquakes, according to the geological survey.
The Earth’s crust is like the shell of an egg. It’s very thin compared to the planet. Like the shell of a hard-boiled egg breaks into pieces when you crack it, the earth’s crust is broken into large pieces or plates and those plates move around, Benthien said.
The Pacific plate moves to the northwest at a speed of 3-4 inches a year, while the North American plate moves to the west-southwest at about an inch a year, according to the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. The motion of the plates around the globe is the primary source of strain that leads to earthquakes.
Major quakes are often preceded by smaller quakes, foreshocks, and followed by additional quakes, aftershocks, which can also be quite large.
Earthquakes often occur in groups of mostly small earthquakes with no identifiable mainshock, according to the geological survey. These groups are called clusters or swarms, terms sometimes used interchangeably, said Steven Sobieszczyk, a spokesman for the geological survey.
A group of researchers at the University of Utah are studying the swarms of earthquakes that occur there. Many of the frequent earthquakes in the region are small, happening imperceptibly, but in surges, clustered in time and space, researchers Gesa Petersen and Kristine Pankow stated in a study published in July.
The “seismic groups” strike a region over a short period of time and dozens have been recorded in Central Utah over 40 years. As many as 30, 40 or 50 events occur over a few hours and then it pauses. That occurs repeatedly, the researchers said.
Of all the sequences of seismic activity in the region, 80% are swarms, the researchers said. The university’s seismologists are analyzing that data to try to determine their significance.
That depends. In the way that people would like to know — a day or a week in advance? No, Benthien said.  
But the probability of a significant earthquake in a specific area within a number of years can be calculated.
For example, seismologists say it's likely the San Andreas will one day have a big earthquake, Benthien said.
The chances of knowing in advance where an earthquake might occur in relation to an earthquake that just occurred, are increasing, Benthien said. For example, they know there will be aftershocks after big earthquakes, he said. “When an earthquake happens, the best we can do is say, there’s a 100% chance there’s going to be aftershocks. There’s a 5% chance that it could be even bigger.” 
The Statewide California Earthquake Center recently received a grant to establish a science "gateway" to improve analysis of rupture forecasts, which could provide information about the likelihood of having earthquakes of different sizes at different locations, and simulate the coupled evolution of earthquakes and faults for the first time. 
That depends where you live, Benthien said. An earthquake can only be as big as the fault line where it occurs, so you have to have a large, long fault to have a large earthquake. 
For example, in the 2015 movie “San Andreas,” with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake in Los Angeles triggered a 9.6 magnitude earthquake in San Francisco. It can't happen, Benthien said. The fault isn't big enough.
It would be unlikely for Southern California to have an earthquake of greater than 8.3 magnitude, the USGS said. They’ve had an earthquake as large as a 7.9 magnitude earthquake in the past. 
A 9.0 or larger earthquake would only occur along a subduction zone, Benthien said. Those occur chiefly in coastal regions where an oceanic plate in the earth’s crust meets a continental plate along a tectonic plate boundary and slides beneath it. 
One subduction zone occurs in Alaska, where a 9.2 earthquake shook the Prince William Sound region in 1964. It remains the most powerful on record in North America. The quake and the resulting tsunami killed 131 people. A peak wave height of roughly 219 feet occurred at Valdez Inlet and waves were detected on tide gages as far away as Cuba and Puerto Rico.
Subduction zones occur around the Pacific, in an area sometimes called the "Ring of Fire" for its earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. It includes the Pacific Northwest, the area of the U.S. at greatest risk, and the west coast of South America, where the largest recorded earthquake in the world – 9.5 – occurred in Chile on May 22, 1960.
Actual shaking rarely causes injury. Injuries and death occur when walls and roofs collapse and glass and other objects fly or fall, especially when people try to move during the shaking, according to Shake Out. No matter where you are, don't move if you can avoid it until you're sure it's safe.
When the shaking starts, ShakeOut advises the following:
