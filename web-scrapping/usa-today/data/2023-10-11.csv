The 2024 election cycle has kicked off. Though Election Day is over a year away, the race is well underway. 
President Joe Biden announced he will seek another term, and with former President Donald Trump's hat also in the ring, a rematch of their 2020 race is a real possibility. Though the Democratic establishment is expected to fall firmly behind Biden, the Republican side is more of a toss-up. 
Trump-endorsed candidates suffered in the midterm elections, and with his legal troubles mounting, the GOP may consider other options. Polls still show Trump with a strong lead however, and many of those trying to unseat him have floundered including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
DeSantis who generated early buzz has suffered in the polls, struggling to translate popularity in Florida to popularity at the national level, and recently firing much of his campaign staff in a major shake-up.
Here are the latest developments on the path to the 2024 election: 
And here are the candidates who have announced their intention to run for president in the 2024 election: 
Joe Biden ∣ Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ∣ Marianne Williamson ∣ Ryan Binkley ∣ Doug Burgum ∣ Chris Christie ∣ Ron DeSantis ∣ Larry Elder ∣ Nikki Haley ∣ Will Hurd ∣ Asa Hutchinson ∣ Perry Johnson ∣ Mike Pence ∣ Vivek Ramaswamy ∣ Tim Scott ∣ Francis Suarez ∣ Donald Trump ∣ Cornel West
Political party: Democrat
Age: 80
Family: Biden has spoken candidly about grief throughout his political career. He lost his first wife Neilia Hunter and their one-year-old daughter Naomi in a 1972 car accident shortly after winning his first Senate race. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were injured in the crash but survived. In 2015, Biden lost Beau to brain cancer and has made it a major political goal to champion cancer research.
He remarried in 1977, tying the knot with now-First Lady Jill Biden. The two share a daughter, Ashley, and a large clan of grandchildren.
Biden's son Hunter has been the subject of scandal in recent years and has written about his struggles with drug addiction. The GOP-led House has seized on Hunter's business dealings, hosting hearings to investigate his finances and the potential influence he has on his father.
Previous political experience: Joe Biden is a veteran of the Senate. First elected in 1972, he served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected as vice president on the Obama ticket in 2008.
After serving two terms as vice president, Biden took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.
His views: Biden's campaign is focused on the "battle for the soul of America," doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago. He said the question facing the nation is "whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer."
Political party: Democratic
Age: 70
Family: Williamson was married once in the late 1970s to a Houston businessman whom she has not named. She has one daughter, India Emmanuelle, whose father has not been publicly identified.
Previous political experience: Williamson is a self-help author and spiritual leader who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020. Then she was largely drowned out by a crowded Democratic field, breaking through for a rare viral moment, but eventually written off as a non-traditional candidate whose views involved centering the "politics of love" and rejecting a “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred.”
Her views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans. She has suggested creating a U.S. Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy, and a U.S. Department of Peace.
Party: Republican
Age: 55
Family: Binkley met wife Ellie in college and the two share five children.
Previous political experience: Binkley is CEO, president, and co-founder of the mergers and acquisitions conglomerate Generational Equity Group. He is also a faith leader, having co-founded and serving as the pastor at Create Church in Richardson, Texas. 
The 2024 run is Binkley's first foray into politics. He says he wants to stand out in a crowded field by prioritizing unity, and leaning on his faith and business experience.
His views: Binkley has said he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform, and putting more community emphasis on education. Binkley is against abortion. Though he signed a highly restrictive bill in his own state, he had indicated he would not do the same nationally and it should be a local issue. Binkley advocates for American energy independence using an "all of the above" approach that encompasses both fossil fuels and new technologies.
Political party: Republican
Age: 66
Family: Burgum wed Karen Stoker in 1991 and the two had three children: Joe, Tom, and Jesse before divorcing in 2003. He remarried in 2016, tying the knot with current wife Kathryn.
Previous political experience: Burgum comes from a business background, once serving as SVP of Microsoft and founding both a real estate and venture capital firm. He was elected governor of North Dakota in 2016 and reelected in 2020.
Burgum’s candidacy is expected to focus more on economics than culture wars – a favored topic of frontrunners Trump and DeSantis.
His views: Burgum has emphasized economic issues, rather than hot-button cultural issues that have been a focal point for some other GOP candidates. He is a vocal supporter of the oil industry, and the U.S. role in exporting it to other nations, and has said he favors smaller government and lower taxes.
Party: Republican
Age: 60
Family: Christie met wife Mary Pat at the University of Delaware and the two wed in 1986. They share four children: Andrew, Sarah, Patrick and Bridget.
Previous political experience: Christie was appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey in 2002 and served for six years. He was elected governor of New Jersey in 2010 and occupied the office until 2018.
Christie has been a prominent figure in the GOP since he launched his first presidential campaign in 2012. He ran again unsuccessfully in 2016 and, despite prior criticism, ultimately endorsed Trump and later joined his campaign.
His views: Christie is anti-abortion, but does support some exceptions in the case of incest, rape, and danger to the mother. He is not for a federal ban, instead believing the issue should be left to the states. He has advocated for a more secure border to stem the flow of fentanyl into the country and is in support of U.S. aid for Ukraine.
Political party: Republican
Age: 44
Family: The governor wed former television host Casey DeSantis in 2009 and the couple share two daughters Madison and Mamie and one son Mason.
Previous political experience: DeSantis serves as the 46th governor of Florida. His national profile grew during the pandemic when he spoke out publicly against mask mandates and pushed to keep many Florida businesses and schools open. Since then, he has captured national attention with controversial legislative measures on education and immigration.
While in law school, DeSantis joined the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer, later deploying to Iraq for active duty. Prior to his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.  
He is widely viewed as Trump’s biggest threat in the Republican primary. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to the former president.
His views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida. He is in favor of "defending parental rights and eliminating CRT," and is anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment.
Political party: Republican
Age: 70
Family: Elder has no children and has been married once. The couple divorced after two years and Elder was engaged again to Alexandra Datig from 2013 to 2015. Amid his candidacy for California governor, Datig went public with an allegation that Elder had once brandished a gun at her while high on marijuana.
Previous political experience: Elder is a lawyer and conservative talk show host who mounted a campaign against California governor Gavin Newsom in 2021's recall election. Though he lost, Elder received the highest number of votes of any candidate besides Newsom.
Elder announced his candidacy on Fox News' "Tucker Carlson Tonight," tweeting afterward "America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable. We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That’s why I’m running for President."
His views: Elder backs school choice, including vouchers and charter schools. His platform also includes a vow to be tough on crime, to secure the border, and to "contain China" by asserting military dominance in the South China Sea and minimizing reliance on the country's manufacturing.
Political party: Republican
Age: 51
Family: Haley is one of four children born to Indian-American parents in Bamberg, South Carolina - a town she has described as divided by race.
She and her husband of 26 years, Michael, live still in South Carolina where they are raising two children Rena and Nalin.
Previous political experience: Haley started her political career in the South Carolina state legislature where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful campaign for the governor's office in 2010. She won reelection in 2014 and has bragged that she has "never lost a race."
In 2016, former President Trump nominated Haley to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down in 2018. Haley has played up her role as a female candidate in what is expected to be a largely male primary field. "May the best woman win,” she quipped in an interview with Fox News.
Her views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel. She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and "getting tough" on China and Russia. She has supported Trump in the past but also criticized him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.
Political party: Republican
Age: 45
Family: Hurd wed Lynlie Wallace, a fellow political operative, in 2022. The two first met in 2009.
Previous political experience: A former CIA officer, Hurd served three terms in Congress representing Texas in the House after first being elected in 2014.
His views: Hurd stands out from an increasingly crowded GOP field as a rare vocal critic of Trump. He joins the likes of Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson in publicly disavowing the former president and in his campaign launch video listed illegal immigration, inflation, crime, and homelessness as legislative priorities.
Political party: Republican
Age: 72
Family: Hutchinson has been married to wife Susan since 1973. The two share four children and seven grandchildren.
Previous political experience: Hutchinson has had a long career in Republican politics. He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to serve Arkansas' 3rd district in 1997; he served until 2001 when he was appointed DEA administrator and later undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security for the George W. Bush administration.
While in the House, Hutchinson served as impeachment manager in the trial of former president (and fellow Arkansas native) Bill Clinton. After leaving Washington he was elected 46th Governor of Arkansas. He served for two terms, from 2015 to 2023.
His views: He supports lower taxes, a strong national defense, and opposes abortion. He has said the Biden administration "stood on the sidelines" in the face of crime and “turned its back on the American worker."
Party: Republican
Age: 75
Family: Johnson tied the knot with wife Diane in 2008, and the pair share three sons.
Previous political experience: A businessman trying his hand at politics, Johnson built his wealth with the launch of Perry Johnson Registrars Inc., a company that ensures auto, aerospace and other businesses are complying with industrial standards. In 2022, he threw his hat in the ring for the GOP nomination for Michigan governor before being disqualified because of invalid signatures.
His views: Johnson told a group of Iowa voters in July that he was "pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, anti-woke and anti-China," − and "if you don't like it, well, tough." His campaign's signature "2 cents" proposes cutting 2 cents off every dollar of federal discretionary spending.
Party: Republican
Age: 63
Family: Pence wed wife Karen in 1985 and the two share three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.
Previous political experience: Pence entered politics in 2000 when he won his local congressional seat. He went on to serve six terms in the House of Representatives before being sworn in as governor of Indiana in 2013.
In 2016, Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate, and he served one term as Vice President. The role thrust him into a precarious situation in 2021 when Trump sought to pressure him to throw out some of Biden's electoral votes to overturn the election.
Pence ultimately defied Trump and certified the results, infuriating MAGA voters and Trump himself. His candidacy will likely involve a difficult tightrope walk as he attempts to distance himself from the former president without alienating the base.
His views: Pence is a vocal opponent of abortion, and of what he sees as the nation's long-term debt problem. He favors cuts in government spending and lower taxes, and while he often touts his time as vice president and speaks well of the policies that came out of the Trump White House, he has begun to distance himself from his former running mate in terms of tone. He has also criticized Trump's actions during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.
Political party: Republican
Age: 37
Family: Ramaswamy married Apoorva Tewari, a throat surgeon and assistant professor at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in 2015. The pair have two sons together. 
Previous political experience: Ramaswamy is framing himself as an outsider, an entrepreneur-turned-political-hopeful who will give the establishment a run for its money. 
He is a former biotech investor who founded pharmaceutical research company Roivant Sciences in 2014. Ramaswamy left the company in 2020 amid clashes with colleagues over how to respond to the murder of George Floyd and the public outcry that followed. He now heads up Strive Asset Management. 
He is the author of three books, including "Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam," which explores how American politics and capitalism have become increasingly intertwined. 
His views: He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action and eliminating the Department of Education. His elevator pitch: He'll go farther than Trump ever did or could today.
Political party: Republican
Age: 57
Family: Scott is unmarried, with no children. He was raised by a single mother in North Charleston and has one brother.
Previous political experience: Scott first entered politics in 1995 during a special election for City Council in Charleston. His profile grew nationally when he suggested posting the 10 Commandments outside the council building, a proposal that was denied.
Scott served for two years in the state legislature before being elected in 2010 to the House of Representatives for South Carolina's 1st district. He served one term before being appointed to the Senate by then-governor Nikki Haley and becoming the first Black U.S. senator from the state.
Scott is pitching himself as a more hopeful alternative to Trump, drawing on Reagan-era ideals and centering a tone of optimism.
His views: Scott joined the Senate in 2013. He’s anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment. He says on his website that his “signature legislation,” Opportunity Zones, put $75 billion into “distressed communities” across the country.
Political party: Republican
Age: 76
Family: Trump is the son of real estate magnate Fred Trump. Born and bred in New York, he first made his name developing skyscrapers and casinos.
Trump first married in 1977, wedding Czech-born model Ivana. The two were married for 13 years and share three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. In 1993 Trump married actress and model Marla Maples. The two had one daughter: Tiffany. Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron.
Trump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr. and Eric were often cited as close advisors.
Previous political experience:  When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to "drain the swamp."
Prior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in "The Apprentice."
In 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.
His views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats. He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.
Party: Democratic
Age: 69
Family: Kennedy bears a powerful last name in Democratic politics. He is the son of Robert F. Kennedy, the former attorney general who was assassinated during a 1968 presidential run, and the nephew of former president John F. Kennedy. Though he originally launched his campaign as a Democrat, Kennedy is now running on an Independent ticket.
Kennedy has been married three times and has six children. He wed current wife Cheryl Hines in 2014. Hines is a television star best known for her role on "Curb Your Enthusiasm."
Previous political experience: Kennedy is an environmental lawyer known for trumpeting a debunked theory that vaccines can be linked to autism.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates, calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times used the Holocaust as a historical comparison. In 2017, former President Trump invited Kennedy to head up a presidential commission on vaccine safety. 
His views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the "liberties guaranteed by the Constitution," according to his campaign website.
Political Party: Green Party
Though West originally announced his candidacy under the People's Party, he later officially filed as a Green Party candidate.
Age: 70
Family: West has been married five times and has two children. He wed current wife Annahita Mahdavi in 2021.
Previous political experience: Dr. Cornel West is an American academic and philosopher known for his progressive ideals. He has taught at a number of Ivy League institutions and works now as a professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary. 
In a video uploaded to Twitter, West announced his 2024 candidacy saying, "I enter in the quest for truth, I enter in the quest for justice." As a third-party candidate, West alleged "neither political party wants to tell the truth" on various issues. His bid with the People's Party represents the first independent ticket to enter the race thus far.
His views: West is a proponent of Medicare for All, and removing oil and gas subsidies as well as drilling on public lands. Long a vocal opponent of militarism, West's campaign website lists "end the wars" as a key priority which would include disbanding NATO and banning nuclear weapons across the globe.
Political party: Republican
Age: 45
Family: Suarez is the son of another prominent Florida politician: Xavier L. Suarez, who was Miami's first Cuban-born mayor. He is married to Gloria Fonts Suarez, and the two share one son and one daughter.
Previous political experience: Suarez serves as the 43rd mayor of Miami, a seat he has occupied since 2017. Prior to that he was Miami City commissioner and served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2022 to 2023.
Views: Suarez has said he did not support Trump in either 2016 or 2020, instead using his ballot to write in the names of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and Former Vice President Mike Pence respectively. As mayor, Suarez has championed growing Miami's tech economy, and he has also backed low taxes and increased police spending.
This story will be updated as additional candidates officially enter the race.
WASHINGTON — House Republicans made a major step towards electing a new speaker on Wednesday, formally nominating as a conference House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.
In an internal secret ballot vote, Scalise beat out his primary rival, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, by a vote of 113-99, according to Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.
The conference vote however, is just a sign of approval from House Republicans at large. The House still has to formally elect a new speaker on the House floor, and lawmakers are still free to nominate other candidates. 
Scalise’s nomination, however, is a major boost for the Louisiana Republican, who is currently the No. 2 ranking House Republican. 
House Republicans could move to hold a speaker election on the floor as early as Wednesday afternoon.
House Democrats are expected to stay out of the process and rally behind House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for the speakership in a show of unity. The onus, they say, is on House Republicans to elect a new speaker. 
SHEFAYIM KIBBUTZ, Israel − They exchanged text messages and emojis. Brief status updates with words of encouragement. A picture of the beloved family dog, Tutsi.
Until no more messages came.
And then, Cindy Flash, an American, and her Israeli husband, Igal, vanished into the violence, presumed kidnapped by Hamas.
Four days after Hamas attacked Israel, more than 100 Israelis and possibly dozens of foreign nationals are thought to be held captive in the Gaza Strip. At least 14 U.S. citizens have been killed and an unknown number are still unaccounted for.
Flash, 67, originally from St. Paul, Minnesota, is one of them. She lives in Kfar Aza, a kibbutz in southern Israel near Gaza, where some of the most harrowing and grisly stories have been emerging over the past few days.
"They are breaking down the safe room door," Flash said in one of her final messages to her daughter Keren, 34. "We need someone to come by the house right now." Keren had been communicating with her parents from a few houses away.
Keren described her mother, an administrator in a local college, as someone who had the "sweetest biggest heart," whom everyone knew and loved, and who had spent a lifetime advocating for the rights of Palestinians, including those who live in Gaza, where she may now be held.
She emigrated to Israel decades ago after a visit during college, when she fell in love with Israel's system of kibbutzim − collectives traditionally centered on agriculture but which have evolved to accommodate myriad interests, tastes and even businesses. 
"They didn't deserve this,'' her daughter said Tuesday on the grounds of a sprawling hotel and resort on a coastal kibbutz northeast of Tel Aviv, where hundreds of people were evacuated after the attack. "No one deserves this."
It was filled with volunteers bringing sandwiches and sweetcakes. Sobbing teenagers, reunited after days of having their worst fears confirmed, hugged one another tightly. Small groups of people sat at tables hunched over laptops compiling lists of the missing. A manager said about 300 people from Kfar Aza were staying at the hotel.
Before the attack, Kfar Aza had a population of about 800. Nobody knows for sure how many survived. 
Cindy and Igal's home in Kfar Aza sits right next to the security fence Hamas militants broke through Saturday morning as they attacked Israel by land, sea and air.
The couple had recently renovated it, which had required that they move away from the kibbutz for a few months.
"They were so happy to be back," Keren said.
And their daughter said that despite their proximity to Gaza, everyone in the family had always felt secure and reveled in their area's lush vegetation, tranquility and sense of community.
In fact, the extended Flash family had expected a very different Saturday from the one they got. 
They had planned a family picnic. And later that afternoon they were going to make and fly kites in the local soccer field as part of an annual community event. Maybe, they thought, they'd have a little ice cream and relax after a hectic week of family life and work. A DJ was going to play.
Instead, Keren, a Pilates instructor, and her husband, Avidor Schwartzman, 37, a media consultant, woke abruptly around 6:30 a.m. to a blaring alarm system and heard what appeared to be the sound of bombs going off. They leaped out of bed and dashed down the hall to grab their 1-year-old baby, Saar, and her bottle, diapers, water and a little food. Then they locked themselves in a room of concrete and reinforced steel.
Around the same time, Cindy and Igal, 66, locked themselves in their own safe room. The sounds of bombs gradually turned into the sounds of automatic gunfire as Hamas militants encircled Kfar Aza and began going house to house to hunt people down.
"We started losing contact with so many people on various WhatsApp groups," said Keren, who along with Avidor and Saar was eventually rescued by Israeli security services. ''We would hear that they were wounded, and then they would just drop off completely."
Israel media reported Tuesday that the bodies of 40 children and babies were found in Kfar Aza, some of whom had been beheaded. An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said Kfar Aza was a "massacre." The bodies of civilians and militants were found scattered throughout the kibbutz. He declined to comment on the beheadings. One report, which USA TODAY could not independently verify, said that multiple people had been beheaded and that charred bodies had been found. The Israeli death toll from the Hamas attack has passed 1,200.
Neither the U.S. nor Israeli authorities had been able to provide them with any information about where her parents might be, Keren said.
But she had not lost hope they would be found.
"Anytime someone calls us, any authority from the kibbutz or anywhere, our hearts sink down, and then they say, 'We don't have any new information.'"
Shaylee Atary, 34, another Kfar Aza resident, spent several days coming to terms with this feeling as well.
She last saw her husband, Yahav Winner, 37, on Saturday as he barricaded a window of their home to allow time for Shaylee and their 1-month old daughter, Shaya, to flee.
"He kept saying to me, 'This is not the day we are going to die,'" Atary said.
"We could hear the attackers walking on the grass outside the window. There was a crunching sound because the leaves have started to fall down because of the season. We couldn't talk because we didn't want them to hear our voices, so we were signaling silently to each other. And then, as they were breaking through the window, Yahav looked at me for a quarter-second. He didn't say goodbye, but I understood that it was like a kind of signal that I should run."
She fled first to some nearby bushes, and then to an empty garden shed.
And running, for Atary, is hard because of a car accident that has made it difficult for her to walk. She also was carrying Shaya.
As she hid in the shed, Atary found a hammer and screwdriver, which she put in her pockets. She put some old pots on her and Shaya's head, who was − miraculously − asleep.
But then the baby woke up and began to cry, which attracted the attention of the attackers. She could hear them walking toward her. She feared they would shoot into the shed indiscriminately.
"I knew I had to run again," she said. "But this time, it was a decision, not so much an instinct. So again I fled, and when I reached a large grassy area that is in the middle of our kibbutz, I thought 'Well, maybe this is how I die, despite what Yahav said.'"
Moments later, a family with children sheltering in their home saw her and ushered her inside, risking their lives. She stayed in this safe room for the next 27 hours, without food or water, and as the oxygen in the sealed safe room dwindled, before they were rescued by Israel's military.
"Yahav is a very protective," she said of her husband. "He's also smart. I believe he probably surrendered to allow us to escape."
Late Tuesday the news finally came. Yahav's body had been found.
"In my head now, I tell myself that when he looked at me what he was saying was: 'Shaylee, you are with the child. I'm holding the door. Go'," she said.
"Then I think, why didn't I say: 'Don't be a hero. Come with me.'"

Is Iran behind Hamas terrorist attacks?What it would mean for US and Middle East security
The Gaza Strip, one of the smallest territories in the world, may soon become a bloody battleground as Israeli Defense Forces strike back against Hamas for its brutal, hostage-taking attack on Israel.   
Gaza is at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian hostility, which has existed since the creation of Israel in 1948. The confrontation going on now is another in a long history of Middle Eastern disputes among Israelis, Palestinians, and others.
USA TODAY looks at this tiny Palestinian enclave, its people, and its place in the ongoing conflict.
The Gaza Strip comprises just under 140 square miles of relatively flat coastal plan bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It is central to the conflict involving Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian territories and various regional actors. Urban areas, refugee camps, border crossings and high-risk areas as defined by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs can be seen in the map above.

Gaza's area is slightly greater than twice the size of Washington, D.C. It is home to 2.3 million people in 139 square miles, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Gaza borders Israeli territory on its northeastern and southeastern sides and Egypt to its southwest. To its west, Gaza abuts the Mediterranean Sea.
At least 2.23 million people live in the Gaza Strip, according to the U.N., many of them displaced after leaving or being driven from Israel during its War of Independence and subsequent conflicts. Gaza is often described as one of the world's most densely populated areas, but population density varies across the territory. There are roughly an even number of women and men living there.
With 42,059 people per square mile, Gaza City is the 63rd-most densely inhabited urban region in the world. At least eight Palestinian refugee camps lie in the Gaza Strip and have some of the highest population densities in the world, according to the U.N.
Hamas is the largest Palestinian militant group and has fired rockets from Gaza at Israeli cities in the fighting. It was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and hasand has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2006, then wresting militarily control from another leadership group in 2007. It's committed to the destruction of Israel and is considered a terrorist group by the U.S., the U.K. and other nations.
According to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the socioeconomic situation in Gaza has been in steady decline for more than a decade. Longstanding restrictions on the movement of people and goods to and from Gaza have made living conditions extremely difficult. Israel prevents all access to and from the Gaza Strip by sea and air. Movement of people and goods is restricted to three crossings: Rafah crossing, controlled by Eqypt, and Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings, controlled by Israel.  
Sixty-three percent of the population of Gaza is considered food-insecure, and 81% are living in poverty. Access to clean water and electricity were at crisis levels even before this month's hostilities. The U.N. secretary-general says the blockade and related restrictions contravene international humanitarian law because they target and impose hardship on the civilian population, effectively penalizing them for acts they have not committed.

The American death toll rose to 22 and Israeli fatalities surpassed 1,200 Wednesday while desperation swept across Gaza as Tel Aviv's response to the brutal attack by Hamas left neighborhoods destroyed, homes dark and hospitals low on medical supplies.
"At this time, we can confirm the deaths of at least 22 U.S. citizens," the State Department said in a statement. "We extend our deepest condolences to the victims and to the families of all those affected."
Israeli soldiers retaking communities near the Gaza border, encountered streets littered with the bodies of civilians, including women and children. The Israeli health ministry said the death toll is likely to increase amid continued fighting and the discovery of more bodies in the settlements.
Palestinian officials say more than 1,100 militants and citizens in Gaza have been killed and more than 5,000 wounded. Israeli rockets smashed into neighborhoods for a fifth day Wednesday, destroying homes and infrastructure.
The territory, home to more than 2 million Palestinians, faced the grim prospects of a complete blackout and limited supplies of food and water. The head of Gaza's Energy Authority told Al Jazeera Mubasher the enclave's only power plant ran out of fuel Wednesday. The U.N.’s World Health Organization said supplies pre-positioned at hospitals were depleted.
“We will not allow a reality in which Israeli children are murdered,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a meeting with soldiers. “I have removed every restriction. We will eliminate anyone who fights us, and use every measure at our disposal.”
Hamas denied targeting children and issued a statement condemning Western media for “promoting the Israeli occupation’s propaganda, which is full of lies and fabrications, as an attempt to cover up the crimes and massacres committed by the Israeli occupation around the clock."

∎ Key Iranian leaders had no advanced warning that Hamas would attack Israel, the New York Times reports, citing U.S. intelligence officials it did not name. The information supports previous Biden administration statements that there was no indication Iran was involved in the attack.
∎ An estimated 250,000 people have fled their Gaza homes, most taking shelter into packed U.N. schools.
∎ Israeli forces exchanged gunfire over Israel’s northern borders with militants in Lebanon and Syria amid concerns of an expanded regional conflict.
Family's painful tale:An American mom, 67, spent her life advocating for Palestinian rights. Then, Hamas came for her.
The Israeli government established a bipartisan war Cabinet to focus on issues of war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be joined by a leading opposition figure and former defense minister Benny Gantz and current Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.
"Israel first of all," Gantz tweeted.
Hamas has said it kidnapped more than 100 Israeli soldiers, men, women, children and older adults and are holding them in Gaza. The Israel government, under intense public pressure to eradicate Hamas, has mobilized 360,000 reservists and could be preparing to launch a ground offensive into Gaza, possibly within days.
EU foreign ministers, meeting in a teleconference, agreed overwhelmingly to continue financial support for Palestinians, said Josep Borrell, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Borrell cited a "clear distinction" between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, which controls the smaller West Bank enclave. Hamas is a terrorist organization while the Palestinian Authority is an EU partner, he said.
"Not all the Palestinian people are terrorists," Borrell said. "So a collective punishment against all Palestinians will be unfair and unproductive. It will be against our interests and the interest of the peace."
The ministers also reiterated long-term commitment to a political solution based on creation of a free Palestinian state. Israel has balked at any plan that would allow Palestinians to possess their own military.
The European Commission warned Elon Musk that X, formerly known as Twitter, could face penalties if it does not take action against "illegal content and disinformation" since Hamas' attack on Israel. A letter from Thierry Breton, European commissioner for the internal market, said the company may be non-compliant of "very precise obligations regarding content moderation" in Europe's new social media laws. The company could be fined up to 6% of its global revenue under EU rules.
In response to the letter, Musk wrote on X: "Our policy is that everything is open source and transparent, an approach that I know the EU supports. Please list the violations you allude to on 𝕏, so that that the public can see them."
Breton replied: "You are well aware of your users’ − and authorities’ − reports on fake content and glorification of violence. Up to you to demonstrate that you walk the talk."

Israeli aircraft and artillery are pounding Gaza towns with what Palestinians are calling "belts of fire." The term refers to intense, successive raids launched against a small target in a short period of time, the Palestinian daily Al-Ayyam reports. The raids began at dawn Wednesday and continued into the day, targeting farmland, police stations, government buildings, factories and other crucial locations, the online outlet reported. Emergency vehicles have been unable to reach some of the battered areas because of the intensity of the raids.
Israeli airstrikes late Tuesday struck the family house of Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ military wing, killing his father, brother and at least two other relatives in the southern town of Khan Younis, senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said. Deif has never been seen in public and Israeli authorities say they don't know where he is.
 Groups who study online hate speech say it has spiked in recent days – not just for Jewish communities but also for Palestinians. And representatives of both communities agree on one thing: U.S.-based social media companies are still not doing anywhere near enough to rid their platforms of hate against targeted groups.
“When it comes to serious crises like these where you're going to see the worst of the worst types of violent content, gore, incitement to violence, it's really incumbent on social media companies to coordinate across platforms,” said Daniel Kelley, director of strategy and operations at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center for Tech and Society, “in order to make sure that the platforms play the minimal amount of role possible in inflaming further violence.” Read more here.

USA TODAY reached out to more than two dozen colleges, many with a history of having a presence in Israel or large study abroad programs, in the last two days to ask how their programs have been affected by the unfolding crisis.
Some schools confirmed students have safely left the area. Others said students and staff remained in the region while their institutions monitor the situation and put in place new safety protocols. A small number of schools reported that by chance this semester they have no students and faculty studying in Israel. Read more here.

At least 22 Americans have died in the onslaught and an unknown number are hostages of Hamas, the Biden administration says. The struggle to come home – and the fear for loved ones left behind in the deadly war zones of Gaza and Israel – is very real for many Americans as the world watches the violence abroad unfold.
The U.S. citizens longing to return to America include several people from church groups, including those in Naples, Florida, visiting Jerusalem for religious reasons, Salt Lake City-based Palestinian-Americans visiting family members and New Jersey Jewish residents who were celebrating the Simchat Torah holiday. They told the USA TODAY Network that their trips turned from a tranquil, joyous crusade away from home into a catastrophic nightmare from which they needed to swiftly escape.
Mark Schwartz, a councilman and volunteer firefighter in Teaneck, New Jersey, had traveled to Israel with friends for Simchat Torah, a Jewish holiday, with other Jewish people from New Jersey.
 "I got a flight to Bulgaria and will somehow get to New Jersey," Schwartz told NorthJersey.com, part of the USA TODAY Network. “Everyone is in a mournful mood." Read more here.

Hamas has vowed to annihilate Israel and for years has been responsible for numerous suicide bombings and other deadly attacks. On Saturday, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea in an attack that caught Israel's military off-guard.
Hamas says the assault was a response to activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem that is the third holiest site in Islam. The site, which is also located on the holiest site for Jews − who refer to it as the Temple Mount − has long been a flashpoint between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli security services routinely raid the compound.
But Hamas leaders also say they were pushed to attack because of unrelenting Israeli crackdowns on militants in the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers illegal − thousands of prisoners being held in Israeli jails and Israel's blockade of Gaza.
Israel countered by declaring war against Hamas and ordered its military to undertake take a "complete siege" of Gaza.
Online hate surges:Why everyone is blaming social media.
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.
Gaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian exclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.
Hamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.
The current war is a culmination of decades of conflict between Israel, which prides itself on its military prowess, and Palestinian territory, which has been occupied since 1948 when Israel was founded and where Hamas rules the Gaza Strip.
At the center of the conflict: Who has the right to the land? Both Jewish people and Muslims have some of their holiest sites in Jerusalem.
Before Israel’s founding, the land was known as the Palestinian mandate, officially ruled by Great Britain. In 1947, the United Nations adopted a resolution that aimed to divide the Palestinian mandate into two states, Arab and Jewish. Large-scale migration of Jewish people to escape persecution, including by Nazis, prompted the U.N. solution.
A war between Israel and its Arab neighbors surrounding its founding in 1948 led to Israeli expansion of 77% of Palestinian mandate territory, and over half the Palestinian Arab population fled or were expelled, according to the U.N. 
Several conflicts between Israel and Arab states in the region followed over the next decades, and peace efforts that improved relations with other nations did not solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination. 
Israel captured the Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has since imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians there. These are all territories sought by Palestinians for their future independent state. The war also led to a second expulsion of Palestinians, according to the U.N.
Hamas rejects proposals for a two-state solution and believes in the eradication of Israel altogether through violent means. 
Palestinian uprisings, or intifadas, brought military clashes and protests against Israeli occupation beginning in 1987 and led to crackdowns by Israel’s military forces, and many were killed and injured on both sides.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since.

Allison Josephs got a bone-chilling threat in 2012 from someone who identified herself as Becky. “Hitler should have finished his good work,” the message read. The writer said she had her Louisville Slugger ready for the “next chance we get.”
The frequency of hate-filled social media posts targeting Jews has only increased since then, said Josephs, a mother of four who runs the nonprofit Jew in the City. 
So she said she was not surprised by the wave of online hate immediately following the deadly attacks in Israel as people celebrated Hamas’ acts of terror, striking fear of more violence to come.
“From a social media perspective, it’s already been so bad, it’s kind of hard for it to get worse,” Josephs said.
But it is getting worse. Groups who study online hate speech say it has spiked in recent days – not just for Jewish communities but also for Palestinians, who have faced increasing online hatred. And representatives of both communities agree on one thing: U.S.-based social media companies are still not doing anywhere near enough to rid their platforms of hate against targeted groups.
“When it comes to serious crises like these where you're going to see the worst of the worst types of violent content, gore, incitement to violence, it's really incumbent on social media companies to coordinate across platforms,” said Daniel Kelley, director of strategy and operations at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center for Tech and Society, “in order to make sure that the platforms play the minimal amount of role possible in inflaming further violence.”
The escalation in harsh rhetoric comes at a time when online hate speech was already increasing, experts said. In the weeks before the conflict, the ADL was locked in a bitter dispute with X, formerly Twitter, over Elon Musk’s alleged promotion of extremists and hands-off approach to content moderation. Meanwhile, 7amleh, an Arab civil rights organization has been meeting with X for months, trying to persuade the company to quell hate speech against Palestinians.
And it’s not just X. Representatives of civil rights groups said they face a constant struggle working with powerful social media platforms to combat hate speech at the best of times. As the conflict in the Middle East escalates, they said, these companies really need to step up their game.

“Social media platforms are putting the burden of monitoring hate speech, incitement and violent speech on civil society organizations with limited resources and this is not OK,” said Mona Shtaya, a nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. “We are talking about tech giants that are making billions of dollars annually, who cannot invest more money and resources in their platforms to protect oppressed communities, especially in times of crisis.”
Several organizations monitoring online hate speech agree there has been a significant increase in such posts in the four days since Hamas attacked Israel. 
Matthew Williams, founder and chief scientist of the online harms monitoring platform nisien.ai, said the online harms monitoring platform has been identifying trends across social media since the conflict broke out. 
"The Hamas terror attack and the subsequent declaration of war by Israel coincided with significant spikes in both forms of hate speech, indicating their roles as 'trigger events,'" Williams said. “Nisien.ai has identified an increase in both antisemitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric, as might have been anticipated.” 
Debunked conspiracy theories, racist posts against Jewish people and Palestinians and hate-filled calls for violence flooded X and other social media platforms over the weekend, according to the groups monitoring them.The ADL noted several examples of such posts in a report released this weekend.
On X, a popular antisemitic influencer posted photographs of the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11 referencing the completely disproven conspiracy theory that the attack was connected to Israel: “It’s hard to have much sympathy for the Israeli regime when they helped perpetrate this attack on my country.” The post had more than 3,800 likes as of Tuesday afternoon.
The ADL counted 347 messages on Telegram from extremists calling for violence against Jews, Israelis and Zionists in the first 18 hours of Saturday, up approximately 488% from the day before. 
7amleh, The Arab Center for Social Media Advancement, a nonprofit that partners with Meta, Facebook’s parent company, has also been monitoring hate speech against Palestinians. The organization’s researchers manually found 260 examples of hate speech across all platforms in the last few days. 7amleh’s automated analysis identified 4,305 posts on X related to the invasion and ensuing conflict that contained violent or hateful speech.
Noting the “surge of antisemitism, hate, disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda spread on social media and messaging platforms,” the ADL released a guide for social media platforms over the weekend. It details seven steps the organization wants social media companies to take immediately, including increasing human and automated trust and safety resources and promoting trusted and reliable news sources.
The ADL’s report also noted that domestic extremists, white supremacists and conspiracy theorists have flocked online to cheer on the attack on Israel. Much of that hate unfolded on Telegram, the go-to messaging and social media platform for extremists. But hateful posts have also been shared on X and on Gab, another fringe platform popular with far-right extremists. 
Social media companies say they are closely monitoring the situation. 
Meta said it has Hebrew and Arabic speakers working around the clock to respond in real time. TikTok said it has also ramped up resources to help curb violent, hateful, or misleading content and boosted moderation resources in Hebrew and Arabic.
YouTube owner Google said during major world events like the Hamas attacks on Israel, it prioritizes news and information from authoritative sources and removes harmful content. Content produced by terrorist organizations including footage showing hostages is not permitted on YouTube and that includes content produced by Hamas, according to YouTube. 
“Hate speech targeting the Jewish, Palestinian or any other religious or ethnic communities is not allowed on YouTube,” the company said in a statement. “This applies to all forms of content, including videos, livestreams and comments, and our policies are enforced across languages and locales.”
Adding to the challenge in monitoring antisemitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric is that “some of this hate is coded, with some posters avoiding recognized racial and religious slurs, and instead constructing their posts using negative stereotypes and tropes,” Williams said.
That makes it more difficult for automatic moderation and human moderators to catch inappropriate posts. As hateful language evolves, and new terms and slogans become popular, moderators must constantly evolve their efforts.
But social media companies like Meta, looking to reduce costs, have eliminated jobs focused on safety issues. They are increasingly leaning on artificial intelligence systems to moderate content and enforce their rules. 
“For the moment we're seeing a lack of investment – we're seeing a lack of ability to independently verify the rate and the amount and the severity of hate,” the ADL’s Kelley said.
X has been widely criticized for its hands-off approach to posts trading in hate speech, misinformation and violence, according to experts monitoring social media.
Posts depicting graphic pictures of murdered civilians and Israeli soldiers, antisemitic hate speech and anti-Palestinian messages are being widely shared on Elon Musk’s platform, those experts said.
X, which gutted its content moderation team under Musk, said late Monday that it was taking the situation seriously as more than 50 million posts about the Hamas attack flooded the platform.
“As the events continue to unfold rapidly, a cross-company leadership group has assessed this moment as a crisis requiring the highest level of response,” the company’s safety account tweeted.
X said its escalations team was “continuing to proactively monitor for antisemitic speech,” removed newly created Hamas-affiliated accounts and took action against “tens of thousands of posts for sharing graphic media, violent speech, and hateful conduct.” It urged people who were concerned about the flood of graphic and misleading content to choose not to see “sensitive media.” X did not respond to a request for comment.
European officials warned X on Tuesday that the company appears to be hosting misinformation about the war in violation of the European Union's content moderation law, CNN reported.
Nadim Nashif, founder and director of 7amleh, said his group has been trying for months to get X to take anti-Palestinian hate speech on the platform seriously. 
Nashif said the company doesn’t do anything to moderate hateful posts written in Hebrew.
The last time 7amleh met with Twitter, they offered the company a lexicon of commonly used hate speech terms in Hebrew, Nashif said. The X representative asked 7amleh to translate it into English, he said.
X is “horrible at content moderation,” he said. “Specifically, in Hebrew, they have nothing. Basically, you can write, ‘kill them,’ ‘rape them,’ ‘burn them’ – whatever you want. It's like an open stage for extremism.”
X’s response to the flood of hate speech has been to promote “community notes,” an outsourced effort that relies on verified volunteers to attach notes to posts that are inaccurate.
Musk praised the open-source effort to moderate harmful content in a post on Tuesday, writing “Thank you for fighting for truth.”
WASHINGTON − The question remains who will hold the gavel for the U.S. House speaker after hardline conservatives ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from the role last week.
McCarthy last week became the first speaker of the House in U.S. history to be removed from the post via a procedure known as a motion to vacate.
The House is currently paralyzed and cannot pass any legislation without a speaker, including crucial government funding or international aid. Speaker pro tempore Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., is serving in a limited role as acting speaker, but it's unclear if McHenry can put any legislation on the House floor.
Here's the latest on the U.S. House speaker election:
McCarthy made several concessions with hardline House conservatives that allowed him to first win the speaker's gavel in January. But these closed door deals unraveled as some of the most conservative members of his caucus, joined by Democrats, removed him from the seat.
The push to oust McCarthy began with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who introduced the resolution to vacate the speaker.
Gaetz and other hardline conservatives were outspoken and shared several complaints with how McCarthy handled the speakership, including failing to negotiate spending cuts and reforms, voting on a stopgap measure to extend government funding, failing to vote on individual spending bills and working with Democrats to avert a shutdown.
McCarthy's reign as speaker ended by a 216-210 vote.
The move to oust McCarthy – known as a motion to vacate – had the support of eight hard-right lawmakers.
McCarthy held the speakership for 269 days − one of the shortest terms for a House speaker in U.S. history.
Two GOP lawmakers have emerged as possible successors to McCarthy: House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and House Judiciary Committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.
Scalise was expected to run for speaker after McCarthy was removed, given his position as the No. 2 ranking House Republican. The Louisiana lawmaker, who suffered a near-death experience in 2017 after a gunman opened fire at a practice session for the Congressional Baseball Game, has commanded respect from virtually every corner of the House GOP conference.
In August, Scalise was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer. He has since started treatment.
Jordan, who was a founding member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has been a close ally of McCarthy and House GOP leadership. Chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, Jordan is one of the lawmakers spearheading House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.
Scalise and Jordan have both already received endorsements from GOP lawmakers, revealing House Republicans' dilemma: The conference remains divided, and it’s unclear who can become speaker.
After McCarthy was ousted from the role last week, House Republicans went home to decide on next steps.
House Republicans met Tuesday night to hold a candidate forum where prospective speakers will make their pitches to fellow GOP lawmakers. Then, they'll hold a secret vote on a nominee Wednesday night.
It's unclear when the House will hold an official speaker election. But the ongoing war between Israel and Palestinian militants could pressure lawmakers to pick up the pace and elect a new speaker so the House can act on the war.

We have a winner!
Bear 128 Grazer topped 32 Chunk to become Fat Bear Week 2023 champion.
This is 128 Grazer’s first win, though she has been a familiar presence for years on the Brooks River at Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska. She has even earned a reputation among fellow bears.
“Grazer is a particularly defensive mother bear who has successfully raised two litters of cubs,” according to Fat Bear Week’s website. “She often preemptively confronts and attacks much larger bears – even large and dominant adult males – in order to ensure her cubs are safe.”
Katami noted many bears remembered 128 Grazer and steered clear this summer, even though she wasn't looking after cubs
“Even though she's a female, (she) is one of the dominant bears on the river, and she's probably the best angler we have,” Naomi Boak, a media ranger at the national park, told USA TODAY. “She's huge, just huge.”
Fat Bear Week’s champion isn’t necessarily the fattest bear at Katmai. The March Madness-style bracket competition is based on popular vote, cast online by fans all over the world. 
All the contenders are winners because they’ve all packed on pounds, gorging themselves on the Brooks River’s bountiful salmon to before hibernating for the winter.
Republican presidential candidate Asa Hutchinson told voters about his vision for America's economy, the future of Social Security, the war in Israel and other major issues around the world during a New Hampshire town hall sponsored by the USA Today Network on Tuesday.
But behind the scenes, the former Arkansas governor got more personal.
Donning a navy blue suit and a white shirt, Hutchinson, 72, talked about what’s on his playlist, what books he’s currently reading and his guilty pleasure TV picks.
As he continues his bid for the White House, here’s a closer look at some of Hutchinson’s favorites on the campaign trail.
Amidst the chaos of a GOP primary campaign, Hutchinson shared that he listens to a wide range of music, from country songwriter and singer Johnny Cash − who was born in Arkansas − to "Come Away with Me" singer Norah Jones.
And Hutchinson usually opts for nonfiction reads.
“I love history books,” Hutchinson said. “And I've actually just finished the book on Abraham Lincoln making his five speeches in New Hampshire in 1861 of them being right here in Exeter at the town hall where we stand.”
He’s said he's also reading "Why We're Polarized," a book by Ezra Klein about American's political divides.
“It's a fascinating book as to how we got to this point of division in our country,” Hutchinson said. “I haven't got to the rest of it yet as to how we're going to end that divide, but it's a good study that I'm engaging in.”
Hutchinson said the prequels and the sequel to Yellowstone, a drama focused on a family ranchers in Montana called the Duttons, is his “habit.”
“I always watch it with my daughter's family in Little Rock, so I've got to get back to binge watch the rest of that series,” Hutchinson said.
He said he’s in the middle of watching "1923," a prequel to "Yellowstone" that follows the Dutton family’s ancestors living in Montana during the Great Depression.
“I'm excited about finishing that,” Hutchinson said. 
Hutchinson told USA TODAY that one of his priorities is to lower interest rates on student loans, saying it's important that students are able to afford the next steps in their education.
"President Biden wanted to wipe 'em all out. You can't do that," Hutchinson said. "That's not right. But to lower that interest rate's the right thing that will help students."
When he was in law school, Hutchinson shared that he couldn’t afford to put gas in his car or buy books.
"We've got to lower the cost of gas," Hutchinson said. "That helps your students as well. And then you're always looking ahead as to a job opportunity. You've got to grow the private sector jobs in our country, grow our economy, and that would be a focus of mine as president."
LGBTQ+ people long for a world where coming out isn't necessary. Where they can hold hands with whomever they choose, kiss their partners in public and use their preferred pronouns without explanation.
In some places around the world – particularly cities throughout the U.S. – it might've felt safe to do so without a second thought the last few years. But the political climate of late suggests coming out won't be over anytime soon.
"Ideally, we are working to create a world without boxes or closets to 'come out of' because we would never be expected to be anything other than who we say we are," says Moe Ari Brown, a licensed marriage and family therapist. "Until that shift happens, we must intentionally choose who we wish to invite into a celebration of our identities."
LGBTQ people should come out and assert their identities in the face of bigotry, though experts say they should never feel obligated to, especially when their safety is at risk.
Coming out is a lifelong process. You don't simply shout "I'm gay" and a rainbow halo sprouts atop your head.
"It really is almost like a matrix or a cycle, in terms of the process of coming out, which happens in so many different ways across our lives," says T.M. Robinson-Mosley, counseling psychologist
In some ways, coming out in America has never been easier. Seventy-one percent of people in the U.S. support marriage equality, according to a Gallup poll published this month. Movies and TV shows have spotlighted queer characters and storylines. More and more LGBTQ+ people hold public office.
But hundreds of anti-LGBTQ+ bills across the U.S. threaten to hinder long fought-for progress. This is also spilling out into the private sector, with brands like Bud Light and Target facing backlash for supporting the community.
Mosley can't help but feel unsafe, nearly seven years after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people and left the queer community terrified.
"Violence has become a much more routine experience, or having protesters outside of drag shows and having places that were once very safe and welcoming and a part of a nucleus in the LGBTQ community have now become battlegrounds," Mosley says.
Visibility may have consequences. But when someone feels safe to come out, it gives those in the closet some hope.
"During a time when extremists are seeking to silence the voices of the LGBTQ community, standing in solidarity and making our presence known is a powerful act of strength and resistance," says Keygan Miller, Interim Director of Public Training at The Trevor Project.
A utopia of a world without coming out may just not be in the cards for a divided society. But future generations will further embrace their identities compared to earlier ones. Gallup research shows that 7.2% of U.S. adults are LGBTQ, and younger generations are responsible for the rise in identifying as such.
Good background:What to know about gender-affirming care for transgender and nonbinary communities
Coming out may go away to some extent. "While I think discrimination may always exist in some form, the intensity and the effect it has on our lives can absolutely change," says Kimberly Vered Shashoua, a therapist who works with queer teens and young adults. Others are more optimistic. "I believe gender and sexual orientation will be irrelevant because we get to collectively choose to eradicate the fear that prevents us from celebrating all people," Brown says. "We get to create this society we dream about. The future is in our hands."

'We're all overcompensating':Why so many LGBTQ community members struggle with body dysmorphia
An array of false and misleading claims have spread widely on social media in the midst of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Israel formally declared war after the Palestinian militant group launched a surprise attack on the morning of Oct. 7. The Israeli military has fought to regain control of several towns on the border with Gaza and responded with retaliatory strikes in the blockaded enclave. More than 1,900 people have died in the ongoing conflict as of Oct. 11.
The ensuing wave of misinformation echoes the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Again, major social media platforms are awash in claims that old photos and videos actually showed the present conflict, while other posts fabricate or exaggerate the nature of the conflict and the American response.
Here's a roundup of claims about the Israel-Hamas conflict from the USA TODAY Fact-Check Team:

Mary Lou Retton, one of the greatest names in U.S. Olympic history, “has a very rare form of pneumonia and is fighting for her life,” according to her daughter McKenna Kelley’s Instagram story.
“She is not able to breathe on her own. She’s been in the ICU for over a week now," Kelley wrote.
According to Kelley's post, which appeared Tuesday afternoon, the family is accepting donations at *spotfund.
Retton, who won the women’s gymnastics individual all-around gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, is 55.
Kelley, who was a gymnast at Louisiana State University, did not immediately respond to messages left by USA TODAY Sports.
Who is Mary Lou Retton? Everything to know about the American gymnastics icon
Retton became the first American woman to win the Olympic all-around title when she captivated the audience in Los Angeles. As one of the breakout stars of the 1984 Summer Games, Retton also won a silver medal on the vault, bronze in the uneven bars and floor exercise, and helped lead the United States to a silver medal in the team competition.
The West Virginia native was honored that year on a famous Wheaties cereal box and later appeared as herself on a number of TV shows as well as in the motion picures, "Scrooged" and "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult." In the fall of 2018, Retton competed in season 27 of "Dancing With the Stars."

Former NFL player Sergio Brown, who police reported missing last month following the fatal bludgeoning of his mother was in police custody in Southern California Wednesday in connection to her slaying, officials said.
Brown was taken into custody while re-entering the United States through San Diego, from Mexico, according to the Maywood Police Department, the agency who reported Brown as a missing person last month.
Aided by other local and federal law enforcement agencies, the San Diego Police Department arrested Brown after a warrant was issued for first-degree murder for the death of his 73-year-old mother Myrtle Brown, Maywood police wrote in a statement obtained by USA TODAY.
On Wednesday, police said in the release, Brown was awaiting extradition to Illinois to face the homicide charge.

San Diego Central Jail records show Brown was booked into the jail just after 3 p.m. Tuesday and being held without bail as a fugitive from justice.
Authorities had been searching for the ex-Indianapolis Colts player, after his mother was found dead on Sept. 16 in a creek near her home in Maywood, a village in suburban Chicago west of downtown.
Police previously had not said whether Brown − who lived with his mother at the time of her slaying − was a person of interest or suspect in connection to her death.
On Wednesday police did not reveal what led them to Brown being a suspect in his mother's killing.

Prior her death, police said the department was informed by family members they could not locate or make contact with the woman or her son.
After her body was located, she was transported to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office
Natalia Derevyanny, a spokesperson for the medical examiner's office, told USA TODAY last month an autopsy revealed she died from multiple injuries related to assault. Her manner of death was ruled a homicide, Derevyanny said.
Sergio Brown played for the Colts 2012-14, as well as three other NFL teams.
He was a star defensive back at Notre Dame before he signed with the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 2010. Brown played seven seasons in the NFL with the Patriots, Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars and Buffalo Bills, with whom he played his final season in 2016.

The upcoming annular solar eclipse may be described as a "ring of fire" for the circular halo that will appear, but the moniker is apt for another unintended reason.
If spectators don't wear proper eyewear to watch as the moon passes in front of the sun to create the dazzling effect, the powerful rays could quite literally burn their eyes and damage their retinas. Come Saturday, potentially millions of people across the United States will be drawn to look to the skies to glimpse the rare annular solar eclipse, which astronomers warn will be the last opportunity to see the phenomenon until 2039.
But gazing at the sun with the naked eye is never wise. That's why astronomers also caution that celestial enthusiasts be prepared with the proper eyewear to view the ring of fire as NASA said it will travel in the U.S. from the coast of Oregon to the Texas Gulf Coast.
How to safely watch the solar eclipse:Rare 'ring of fire' has the potential to damage your eyes if you don't take precautions
According to NASA, the only safe way to watch an eclipse is through a pair of approved solar eclipse glasses or a handheld solar viewer.
Fortunately for stargazers, solar eclipse glasses are readily available for purchase and even for free ahead of the ring of fire, which should be viewable in some form in all lower 48 states.
But don't confuse the specialized eyewear with your run-of-the-mill sunglasses: certified solar eclipse glasses are held to an international safety standard and are 100,000 times darker to block nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light.
In Buffalo, New York, for instance, Erie County officials provided funding to hand out hundreds of thousands of the eyewear at its local libraries, according to the Buffalo Museum of Science.
Many libraries around the country, in fact, will be giving away free pairs of approved eclipse glasses through Saturday. The Space Science Institute distributed 5 million solar-viewing glasses to 10,000 libraries and maintains a map of participating libraries on its website.
Residents in Memphis, Tennessee have several options available to acquire solar eclipse glasses, according to the Commercial Appeal, a USA TODAY Network publication. In addition to the city's libraries giving away the eye protection, a popup shop will also be open every day through Saturday where glasses produced by American Paper Optics costing up to $20 are for sale.
American Paper Optics, the nation's largest supplier of eclipse glasses, also offers express shipping across the country.
Plenty of other online sellers have eclipse glasses for sale that are compliant with ISO 12312-2, a long number that simply specifies the properties that a solar viewer should have in order to protect eyes from injury.
For more manufacturers and retailers who sell certified glasses, the American Astronomical Society maintains a curated list of approved vendors.
Of course, Prime Day may be over, but consumers can also turn to Amazon for their eclipse-watching needs. The online retailer has a variety of certified solar eclipse glasses, many of which can be bought in bulk (including a 50-pack for $49.99.)
But be wary of counterfeit or unsafe eclipse glasses when shopping Amazon. If the seller's name is not one of the verified suppliers on the American Astronomical Society's list, look elsewhere.
Will 2024 solar eclipse be better?Real showstopper comes in April when large portions of the country see an even more impressive total eclipse
At least some of the sun’s powerful light will be visible Saturday even in places without a view of the spectacular partial solar eclipse.
Directly staring at the sun at any time can cause blindness or disrupted vision, but the concentrated solar rays of the partial eclipse are especially acute. Looking at it through a camera lens, telescope or binoculars is also dangerous, as the rays can burn through even those filters, according to NASA.
An annular eclipse is different from the nighttime darkness of a total eclipse in which the Moon completely blocks the face of the Sun from Earth's view, the next of which is expected to occur in April.
Rather, an annular solar eclipse occurs when the moon is at the farthest point of its orbit from Earth and passes in front of the sun. Because it is incapable of completely blocking the sun, the moon instead appears as a smaller dark disc in front of the larger and brighter star, creating what looks like a ring of fire.
Weather permitting, the eclipse will first become visible in Oregon around 9:13 a.m. PDT and end in Texas around 12:03 p.m. CDT, according to NASA. It will then move beyond the U.S. and over Mexico, Central America and finally South America before ending around sunset off of Natal, Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean.

Morgan State University leaders have announced plans to build a wall around the campus after a shooting that injured five people, including four students, during homecoming week celebrations. Police, meanwhile, are calling on the public to help them identify two persons of interest in the case.
David Wilson, the president of Morgan State University, said at a campus town hall Tuesday that the wall would effectively "eliminate unfettered access" by extending existing barriers by about 8,000 feet, encircling 90% of the campus.
“We’re doing this, let me be clear, not to keep out our neighbors and our community writ large," Wilson said. "We are doing it to keep out the bad actors."
In addition to the wall, possible upgrades include installing more metal detectors in campus buildings, exploring weapons detection technology, increasing police patrols and building additional security guard booths.
Wilson said that the expected cost is more than $22 million and that a proposal will be sent to Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.
On Tuesday, the Baltimore Police Department posted images of two men sought in connection with the Oct. 3 shooting. The images, taken by surveillance cameras, were accompanied by a plea to the public for help identifying the two men. Days earlier, police released a video showing several people walking in a grassy area along with a request for tips that may lead to their identification.
The combined reward totals for tips leading to an arrest and charges is at $9,000, authorities said.
Gunfire erupted on campus around 9:25 p.m. after a dispute between two groups, authorities said. All the victims, 18 to 22 years old, were unintended targets.
The shooting occurred just after a coronation ceremony, an event that was part of a pre-homecoming game ritual and prompted an hourslong lockdown on the campus as SWAT officers cleared a dorm building where investigators believed shooters may have fled. None were found.
All of the victims were sent to the hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening.
The shooting canceled the rest of the week's homecoming events, including Saturday's football game, for the first time in the university's history.

Our politics is dominated by the old. Although the median age of the rest of America is 38.9 years, the median age in the U.S. Senate is 65.3 and is 57.8 years in the House of Representatives.
And, of course, the two front-runners for the 2024 presidential race, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, would be well into their 80s before one or the other left the Oval Office in 2029.
Unlike some of my fellow Generation Z, which spans from 1997 to 2012, I generally favor older people in office. Young people are still forming their belief systems and learning how to accomplish the things they want to achieve. Older politicians have more life experience and are less likely to radically change their ideological positions in response to a new crisis. 
Career politicians tend to understand how the system works and the mechanisms to get things done. While I get frustrated by a Congress predominantly made up of out-of-touch older people, inexperience is never a virtue, as much as young perspectives might be valued. 
However, as always, there is a line. As could be seen with recently deceased Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who was 90, access to the high-level medical care that our federal elected leaders enjoy can mitigate the effects of aging for only so long. 
Trump or Reagan?Gen Z conservatives must decide what values we really hold true.
Aging also raises the risk of cognitive decline. A recent poll from NewsNation/Decision Desk found that 74% of voters were “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” with how Biden's cognitive health might affect a second term. And 59% of those polled said the same about Trump.
Partisan politics may skew those numbers, but if more than half the country is concerned about our leading presidential candidates' competency to serve as commander in chief, we ought to take note.
Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and one of Trump's rivals for the GOP presidential nomination, has proposed requiring a mental competency test for candidates older than 75.
Biden, to no one's surprise, has scoffed at the idea. Trump, on the other hand, endorsed it but doubted the practicality of requiring a mental competency test: “A lot of people say it’s not constitutional to do it.”
Yet, polling suggests that 76% of Americans strongly or somewhat support such tests for politicians. 
Trump and GOP turn off young voters.Here's how Republicans can appeal to them.
While mental competency tests would be a good thing, declining physical health also needs to be taken into account. It may not be polite to say it, but the older the president, the higher the risk that America's commander in chief will die while still in office.
With all the chaos in the nation and the world now, America shouldn't risk the uncertainty and dangers of a sudden transfer of presidential power.
I think neither Biden nor Trump should serve a second term because of their character and policy positions. Their age is just another important factor for why voters need strong (and younger) alternative candidates.
Sadly, voters appear too locked into partisan combativeness to fairly evaluate whether Biden and Trump are capable of serving effectively as octogenarians.

Israel’s Iron Dome is considered a highly effective missile defense system, with its latest success rating of 96% in destroying rockets fired from Gaza in May 2023, according to Israeli Defense Forces.
So did Hamas defeat the billion-dollar Iron Dome ahead of its surprise attack on Israel?
The militant group said it launched 5,000 rockets in 20 minutes – Israeli Defense Forces said 2,200 were fired – that overwhelmed the Iron Dome system. An attack of that intensity can exhaust defensive missile stockpiles, which take time to reload.
Even if a lower number of 2,200 to 3,000 missiles were fired in 20 minutes, the quantity "was simply too much for Iron Dome to manage," according to an analysis by the Modern War Institute at West Point.
"You've seen footage of these (Israeli) interceptor missiles blowing up Hamas rockets in midair, but it's got a limited number of these interceptor missiles at any one time," Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst in defense strategy at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told abc.net.au.
"One way to defeat it is simply overwhelm it. And that's a weakness of any air defense system," Davis said.
“With thousands of rockets in the air in a very short period of time, there is not a single air defense system in the world that's going to be able to cope with that," Ben Barry, Senior Fellow for Land Warfare at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, told thenationnews.com.

The Iron Dome is a mobile all-weather missile defense system, designed to detect and shoot down short-range rockets fired into Israel. It’s also used against enemy artillery and drones.
Iron Dome can detect and engage rockets up to 40 miles away. Each of its 10 batteries can protect a 58-square-mile area.
It’s a portable system, towed by trucks. The batteries are units with three main elements:
Work on the Iron Dome began in 2007. It became operational in March 2011 and has been upgraded over the years. Its success rate has exceeded 90% since being activated, Raytheon says.
Iron Dome is designed as protection against rockets at low altitudes. It's part of Israel's three-tiered air defense system that includes:
◾ David's Sling: Defense against short-range ballistic missiles, large-caliber rockets, and cruise missiles.
◾ Arrow-3: Defense against medium-range ballistic missiles.
Much of the Israeli-Palestinian fighting in May 2021 was an air war, with Hamas firing long-range rockets at Israeli cities and Israel retaliating with airstrikes that targeted buildings in Gaza.
Rocket warfare between the two is not unusual. But there's a difference now: Though Israel retains an overwhelming advantage, Hamas, the Islamist militant group in the Gaza Strip, has more and better rockets, which may affect future conflicts.
From May 11 to the cease-fire on May 21, Hamas launched a significantly higher number of rockets into Israel, much more than in previous conflicts, according to Michael Armstrong, associate professor and missile warfare researcher at Brock University.
"The rocket fire differed from the 2014 and 2012 conflicts in a couple of ways," Armstrong says. "One was the quantity of rockets."
Hamas fired an average of 500 missiles a day for the first week of the May conflict, Armstrong says. "In 2014, the busiest day was 192. In 2012, it was 316."
"They may have better supplies of rockets," Armstrong says. "They seem to have more of the longer-range rockets, which is another important change."
More rockets hit their intended targets. About 50% have threatened populated areas in Israel, Armstrong wrote in an analysis for The Conversation. In 2014, the rate was 18%. In 2012, it was 22%.
Iran has supplied Hamas with rockets and technical aid, but the militants are starting to build rockets on their own, using parts scavenged from recovered Israeli missiles and common items such as water pipes, The New York Times reported.
With its offensive weapons and defensive systems, Israel retains an overwhelming military superiority over neighboring Palestinians. But Hamas has improved its rocket capabilities.
Israel's weaponry is aided by foreign assistance, as well as producing its own cruise and ballistic missiles. Israel also exports missile systems. Israel is believed to have nuclear weapons, but it has never admitted or denied possessing them, according to the Arms Control Association.
Israel also has long-range ballistic missiles, which are capable of reaching as far north as Norway and Sweden, eastward into Russia and China and south into central Africa.

An Alabama woman who disappeared after telling police a story about a child walking along a highway is due in court Wednesday for criminal charges she faces in relation to the frenzy.
Carlethia "Carlee" Russell, 26, faces two misdemeanor charges in Hoover, about 10 miles south of Birmingham, for falsely reporting to law enforcement, which could carry up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine if she's convicted. Hoover Police Chief Nick Derzis said in a July news conference her decisions created national panic and alarm that a possible kidnapper was on the run and using a toddler as bait.
"I know many are shocked and appalled that Ms. Russell is only being charged with two misdemeanors," Derzis said in late July. "I, too, share the same frustration."
Amanda Priest, spokesperson for the Alabama Attorney General's office, said the charges fit well with this case as the state's laws don't allow for harsher penalties.
Russell's attorney, Emory Anthony, declined USA TODAY's request for an interview until after the court date.
Court Director and Chief Magistrate Susan Fuqua told USA TODAY attorneys will meet in the afternoon to discuss how to proceed with the case. If the case goes to trial, Fuqua said the earliest possible date could be set for January because of the upcoming holidays.
Russell initially went missing in Hoover on July 13 and reappeared at home 49 hours later.
She called police to report a toddler walking along Interstate 459 South in just a diaper, but police were unable to confirm Russell's report. She later called her brother's girlfriend, who reported she heard Russell scream before losing contact.
Hoover police said in a July 14 statement they weren't able to locate Russell or the child. They released video surveillance of Russell's red Mercedes-Benz pulling over on the highway with hazards on, but it doesn't show anyone driving up to Russell.
During a July 19 press conference, Derzis said Russell claimed to see a toddler wearing just a white T-shirt and a diaper, and a man came out of the woods telling her he was searching for the child.
The woman later told police she was placed in a semi-truck and overheard a man and woman talking while a baby was crying. Russell said she escaped but was recaptured and blindfolded, then taken to a home where she was fed crackers. She told police the couple made her take her clothes off and took pictures of her.
Nearly a week later, Anthony, her lawyer said she was never abducted and she admitted to lying about the missing child report.

Editor's note: Part one of a five-part USA TODAY series revealing why America hasn't solved its long struggle with Type 2 diabetes.
For chef Robin Ray, newly married with young stepchildren, the turning point came when a stabbing chest pain sent her rushing to the emergency room. 
For Brian Castrucci, the gravity hit when the ER doc who had treated him for a near-heart attack a few weeks earlier gave him a big bear hug. “I didn’t think you’d make it,” the doctor said.
The crisis unspooled more slowly for James Haynes but started in 2019 when he stepped on a rusty nail and didn’t notice. 
The moments were turning points for all three to get serious about addressing their diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can’t properly regulate blood sugar, has become so common it’s almost considered inconsequential. More than 1 in 10 Americans have the disease (though many don't know) and another nearly 4 in 10 are at risk for it. In total, half of all adults and a quarter of teenagers have diabetes or pre-diabetes.
Its financial costs are astronomical. The country spends more than $300 billion a year to address diabetes, accounting for $1 out of every $4 spent on health care. 
And its personal tolls are even worse: heart attacks, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, double the risk of premature death. It also causes what’s known as “diabetes distress,” the daily burdens and emotional toll of living with and managing a chronic ailment that can lead to regular dips in energy, foggy thinking and depression, and a sense of isolation.
The most frustrating aspect of Type 2 diabetes, experts say, is that it has long been largely preventable and controllable. 
“We have made tremendous gains in understanding diabetes,” said Dr. Donald Berwick, a pediatrician and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “The best diabetes care can make a very big difference. You can’t say we don’t know what to do.”
And yet, diagnosed rates of Type 2 diabetes have soared over the past 25 years, and especially over the past dozen – particularly among working-age adults like Ray, Castrucci and Haynes. 
Roughly 40% of people who died early in the coronavirus pandemic had Type 2 diabetes, a rate four times higher than people without the disease. Even when elevated blood sugar levels are below the threshold for type 2 diabetes, the risk for heart disease jumps 30% to 50% compared with people with normal blood sugar levels. (Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 5% to 10% of diabetes, is caused by the immune system and is unrelated to diet or lifestyle.)
America’s failure to address Type 2 diabetes highlights larger problems with our food and medical systems, Berwick and other experts said.
A soda costs less than a bottle of water, a double cheeseburger and fries less than a carton of blueberries. Patients wait months for medical appointments only to see the back of a white coat for the short time they’re allotted. Treating disease costs society far more than preventing it but typically provides more profit for insurance companies, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry.
The USA TODAY Health team spoke with scores of health care providers, researchers, community leaders and patients for this five-part series to understand why Type 2 diabetes continues to worsen in America despite known solutions.
The answer isn't simple. It involves systemic problems facing everyone in society, not just those with diabetes: a food system designed to sell products; a medical system in which cutting off a leg is less expensive than saving it; the high cost of healthy living and the fact that breaking habits takes a lot more than just personal willpower.
This first story looks at what it takes for people to cope with or overcome the disease.
Then, we explore one community in a David vs. Goliath battle against a food system that fails to prioritize people's health.

We next travel to Colorado, which has the lowest level of diabetes in the nation. Yet even in this state, where hiking trails and gorgeous views abound, economic and other disparities make it easier for some people to avoid diabetes than others.

Finally, we explore solutions, addressing why it will take a combination of education, medication, medical devices and improved food access to solve this national problem.
More in series:Solutions exist to end the Type 2 diabetes dilemma but too few get the help they need
The system is fixable, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.
But it will take "sensible action" from across many sectors, including health care, science, nutrition, business, public health and politics to change the financial and other incentives that drive so many Americans toward sickness instead of health.
"If we do it all, we could fix a lot of this in 10 years," said Mozaffarian, who serves on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. "If we do it incrementally or don't do it at all, we're all going to be toast in 50 years from diet-related illnesses and a depleted environment."
There’s no question personal responsibility plays a role in fighting diabetes. 
Haynes, Ray and Castrucci radically changed their lifestyles and sought help after their come-to-Jesus experiences. They’ve reduced their dependence on daily medication and hope to have saved themselves the horrors of more amputations, blindness and dialysis. They’ve extended their lives and improved the quality of that time.
But like many medical problems, the challenges of diabetes go well beyond individual responsibility and blame. 
“There are structural issues that we have to start paying attention to and addressing,” said Dr. Shivani Agarwal, an endocrinologist who specializes in research and treating young adults with diabetes at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Agarwal recently led a series of studies in the journal The Lancet that looked at diabetes rates around the world. 
Poverty, the studies showed, was a major driver of diabetes, along with racism and unequal access to healthy food and high-quality medical care.
Personal stories illustrate how these structural issues play out in the lives of so many Americans.
Ray, 45, director of culinary operations at HOSCO/North Sarah Food Hub in St. Louis, got weight-loss surgery and then put her culinary expertise to good use.  
Castrucci, 49, who runs a public health nonprofit outside Washington, D.C., used his advantages provided by his work, salary and insurance to “buy” himself better health.
 “I’m healthy because of privilege – not diet, not exercise, not determination,” he said.
Haynes, 58, a former truck driver and maintenance technician in Gulfport, Mississippi, has fewer material assets, but his attitude and the advantages he does have explain why he's still around, despite all he has been through.
“It’s going to be all right after a while, as long as I keep this spirit,” he said.
Ray’s love for food began when she was 8 years old, watching Julia Child on TV. During family gatherings, she would run around taking everyone’s dinner order. Then she’d scurry back to the kitchen with a notepad full of scribbles. 
Throughout her life, she made fried chicken, pork chops, baked mac and cheese, collard greens, and even a whole roasted chicken filled with wild rice and two sticks of butter – everything that made her soul sing. 
In her world, food was home. Food was family. Food was love. 
But that was some pretty tough love. 
In 2002, Ray was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Her father, grandmother, aunts and uncles all had diabetes. She knew what it meant.
“For you to tell me I can’t have ice blue raspberry Kool-Aid was like you shut down my world,” Ray said. “I didn’t want to accept it. So, I ate, because you eat through your emotions.” 
She didn't dwell on the diagnosis and continued with life. Her culinary career took her to Italy, where she learned and fell even more in love with food. She returned to St. Louis, got married and became a mom to her husband’s two children ‒ “beautiful bonus babies,” as she described them. Through the years, she continued to express love through cooking and eating. 
In 2015, a stabbing chest pain sent her to the emergency room. Doctors assured Ray she hadn’t had a heart attack, but they warned that her life was on the line. At 5-foot-2, she weighed 334 pounds and had an A1C, a measure of average blood sugar of 11%, well above the 6.5% cutoff to be considered diabetic. Her diabetes – and her diet – were out of control. 
“That scared me. … It was gut-wrenching and terrifying,” she said. “I’m fighting against something that’s fighting me back and I did not know how to win.” 
She and her primary care doctor decided she would pursue weight loss surgery. 
But she also decided to use her culinary prowess to transform her diet. She reconfigured favorite foods, substituting healthier ingredients: Collard greens cooked in smoked fats or ham hocks turned into a kale, turnip and rutabaga recipe flavored with natural chicken broth fat, oils and seasonings. 
She fostered her feelings into new recipes and brought them to North Sarah Food Hub, which partnered with Barnes-Jewish Hospital to make packaged, pre-made meals for St. Louis residents with diabetes and limited access to fresh food.
“I had to restructure the food that I put in my mouth. I had to think about what I was eating and how I was eating and how it was going to be good for my body,” she said. “I became excited about food again, and food became a joy.” 
It isn’t always easy, of course. Ray admits to an occasional cookie craving. But now she takes the time to think about how her body processes that cookie and whether it’s worthwhile. 
She hopes her cooking can help other people make the same transformation she did. Her staff at North Sarah helps her create new recipes for others. She wants to provide nourishment that allows people to avoid illness and medicine. 
“Nobody wants to take 55 pills, nobody wants to feel like a patient, but how do you fix that? It’s by our food,” she said. “That should be what we’re teaching our community and our culture and our children. … It’s not always about the macaroni noodle with a smile, it’s about what’s good for your body.” 
Castrucci is a third-generation diabetes patient. The lifetime risk of developing Type 2 diabetes if a parent has it is 40%. If both parents have it, the risk jumps to 70%.
He knew he was at risk, but he pushed his luck, he said, by eating poorly during the pandemic and falling out of his exercise routine. With the luxury of working from home, walking to the kitchen and bathroom was often the extent of his daily activity.
On Feb. 14, 2022 – Valentine’s Day – he went to an urgent care clinic, concerned his breathing trouble meant he had bronchitis. His blood pressure measured 210 over 110, well above normal levels that top out at 120 over 80. A chest X-ray showed fluid filling his lungs, leading to congestive heart failure. 
The clinic sent him straight to a local emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a blockage of the left descending artery – a clogged artery made worse by diabetes. If he had waited any longer, he would have had a massive heart attack, his doctor later told him.
After his release from the hospital, he went to the drugstore to fill his new prescriptions. The pharmacist told him she couldn’t fill one because it would cost $1,000. He’d have to wait until his insurance approved it. “Please fill it,” he said. She stressed the cost. “Fill it,” he pleaded, putting the charge on his credit card.
Medication helped him lose 70 pounds in three months. When his local drugstore ran out of the weight-loss drug, he easily drove to another pharmacy and then another to find what he needed. 
His 100 hours of high-quality cardiac rehabilitation were fully covered by insurance.  
"For my midlife crisis, I got healthy," Castrucci said.
He could devote all his energy to getting well because he didn’t have to focus on how to afford his care. “(I) paid almost nothing for the whole episode,” he said, “and never worried about it because I have really good insurance.” 
Even so, Castrucci pays out-of-pocket for a cardiologist and an endocrinologist because the best ones near him don’t accept insurance.
Every time he goes to Walgreens to refill his medications, Castrucci said, he sees someone turned away because they can’t afford their prescriptions. When they finally show up in the emergency room, “because they will,” they will cost the system far more, he said.
“Health outcomes are dictated by economics. It’s a whole side of privilege that we don’t always talk about.”
On the day Haynes stepped on a rusty nail in 2019, he walked all day as the nail pierced the sole of his sneaker and then his foot. By the time he took off his shoe that night, his foot was infected. He landed in the hospital for two months as doctors and nurses tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to get the infection and Haynes’ blood sugar under control.
By the time he was released, he knew enough about Type 2 diabetes to realize his daily blood sugar levels – typically in the mid-400s – were four times above what he had been told to shoot for.
But nothing he did or ate seemed to make a difference. He had long since traded ribs for salads, beer for water. 
His wife, Angela, barely noticed when James started wearing multiple pairs of socks, pouring powder on his feet and buying bigger shoes. His feet tingled a lot, he said, but he was coping with it. 
James ended up in the emergency room again, dehydrated and in need of antibiotics. The doctor amputated the baby toe on his right foot, leaving a large open wound. 
"We're going to leave this open because we'll probably have to take more,” Angela remembered the doctor saying. “I didn't like that we're not going to try to save anything, we're just going to start cutting.”
James was fading.
His arm muscles shriveled and he lost his Popeye physique. Antibiotics left him looking sickly, his voice so weak Angela could barely hear him. “I felt like I was watching my husband slowly dying,” she said.
Finally, taking her doctor sister’s advice, Angela emailed Dr. Foluso Fakorede’s office to ask for an appointment. She thought it would take months to get James in to see the heart disease specialist, but the office called and asked if they could come the next day. 
The Hayneses would end up going back to see Fakorede many times − sometimes twice in one week, driving more than five hours each way from Gulfport north to Cleveland, Mississippi.
“We started looking forward to these visits because there was always hope,” Angela Haynes said, though she felt guilty they were taking up so much of the important doctor’s time. 
Fakorede, who is on a personal mission to save people with diabetes from amputations, noticed what other doctors had missed. Haynes had blockages in blood vessels on both legs. 
Once he got the blood flowing again, Haynes began to feel better. His flesh returned to its normal color. The wound started healing at last. Walking became easier.
Then disaster struck again. 
On July 2, 2022, Haynes caught COVID-19. "Everything went downhill after that," he said.
During his 13-day illness, the bacteria in his foot raged out of control. He ended up back in the hospital and unable to withstand the long drive to Fakorede’s office.
Every week, a surgeon would come to the door of his hospital room and before even stepping all the way in ask Haynes whether he had decided to get his leg amputated. 
"This is my leg. I was born with this. And you're walking in like you're cutting a piece of cake," Haynes said.
He was worried about how he’d get around, how he’d be able to work to support his family if he had only one leg. No one took the time to explain why they thought the leg needed to come off or how he’d cope without it, Haynes said. 
In late November, he was finally sent home in a wheelchair. But just three weeks later, as he was getting out of the car after wound care, his right leg gave out and he fell to the ground. Back at the hospital, Haynes was told his foot was broken, essentially beyond repair. He agreed to a below-the-knee amputation.
Released right before Christmas, he spent the next three weeks in bed wondering how he’d manage the rest of his life.
Finally, it looked as if his luck might be turning around.
With the leg gone, his diabetes improved. His blood sugar dropped into the 120s or one-teens. His blurry vision cleared up.
During his long hospital stay, he befriended nurses and learned about a program for people who needed prostheses. The man who ran it called early in the year and said he had received a donated leg. If it fit Haynes, he could have it while waiting for insurance to pay for a personalized one. Miraculously, it did. 
Haynes spent the next six months teaching himself to walk again. The donor leg was heavy and uncomfortable. He wasn't mobile enough to hold down a job.
One late spring night, picking up dinner at a nearby restaurant, he headed to the bathroom for a pit stop. A sink had been leaking all day and Haynes slipped in the puddle, falling backward.
He's still recovering from the resulting wrist surgery.
He and Angela are living – barely – off her part-time salary as a secretary and a church organist.
Haynes has tried "at least three or four times" to receive government assistance, but they keep losing his paperwork, or not believing he's disabled, though he once checked himself out of the hospital and arrived at an appointment in his wheelchair to prove he didn't have a leg.
Still, he clings to his faith and the positive attitude he has long used to cheer up himself and others. These are his secret weapons against diabetes and everything else life throws his way.
"I try to put a smile on other people's faces," he said. "It keeps my day going."

The USA TODAY Best-selling Booklist is back!
After a brief hiatus, USA TODAY’s beloved bestsellers list has returned with the features and characteristics that have long made it the People’s Booklist.
Our goal remains the same: Provide book lovers with the best, most accurate snapshot of what people are reading by showing which titles are selling. It is a master list, unbound by genre and format, of what’s selling broadly across the U.S.
“I am so thrilled that the USA Today Best-selling Booklist is coming back!" says bestselling author Colleen Hoover in a statement. "It gives so many authors the wonderful opportunity to be recognized as bestsellers and for readers to discover their next favorite book.”
Hoover, the self-published writer turned bestselling powerhouse who's authored dozens of novels including "It Ends With Us" and "Verity," was the undisputed queen of the Booklist in 2022 and spent weeks atop the list. Her novel "It Starts With Us" claimed the No. 1 spot in its first week, her highest debut ever, selling more than 800,000 copies on its first day of sales. It was her fourth book to hit No. 1 in 2022.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
The USA TODAY list is a ranking of the top-selling titles each week from a broad range of businesses including major chains, independent bookstores and online retailers. It reflects combined sales of titles in print and electronic format, if available. Our data team weighs and compiles those numbers to generate the week's 150 top-selling titles. The rankings reflect sales from the previous Monday through Sunday. The full list will publish online at 6 a.m. Wednesdays, with the top 50 titles publishing in print Thursdays.
The list, which began in 1993, went on hiatus in December. It is the longest-running USA TODAY data journalism project.
In our continued commitment to bring readers more books coverage, USA TODAY is also excited to announce a new content partnership with The Novel Neighbor, an independently owned and operated bookstore in St. Louis. They are expert booksellers and passionate readers who are deeply connected to what their community is reading. With the partnership will come regular profiles of independent bookstores across the country, highlighting the important role of these businesses in their local communities. Novel Neighbor will also be sharing expert book recommendations and fun takes on book trends.
We can't wait to see what you've been reading!
A year ago, President Joe Biden’s plan was to forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt for tens of millions of Americans. 
With that plan now extinct, the first of several conversations to hash out a new strategy for erasing loan balances en masse began Tuesday and continues Wednesday.  
"Creating clearer regulations will ensure the authority to waive student debt is used in a fair and lawful manner," said James Kvaal, under secretary of education said Tuesday, as the first of three of these two-day talks began. "We believe that doing so will strengthen the entire student loan system, help us tackle pervasive problems in the system, and help ensure postsecondary education is a path to opportunity for more students."
As the process of negotiated rulemaking, or neg reg as it’s sometimes called in federalese, gets underway, tens of millions of Americans are wrestling with student loan payments for the first time in more than three years. Social media is littered with evidence of confusion about the size of monthly payments. Some people say they are puzzled about why they are being billed at all. One set of borrowers has their payments set to zero because of a new federal repayment option called SAVE that aims to be more generous than any other.
The negotiators resume their conversation at 10 am Eastern time Wednesday, and it will be livestreamed with a chance for the public to weigh in. Here’s what you need to know:  
Another legal challenge:Biden student loan debt forgiveness plan for 804,000 borrowers faces another day in court
The process the Biden administration has turned to is called negotiated rulemaking. It has been used many times over the years to draft rules related to higher education, including on how Title IX law on sexual assault is applied at schools and colleges and how well colleges produce graduates whose jobs can cover their student debt.
The people who will hash out the student loan plan applied or were nominated to participate and then were selected by the Education Department. They represent different groups who have a stake in student loans, such as borrowers, student loan servicers and colleges and universities. Some of the members include Wisdom Cole, national director of the NAACP Youth & College Division; Yael Shavit, an assistant attorney general in the Consumer Protection Division of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office; and Jada Stanford, a student at Stephen F. Austin State University in Texas. 
This is a list of the committee members, including alternates, selected ahead of Tuesday's meeting. But on the first day, the committee chose to add representatives of two additional groups – consumer advocates and individuals with disabilities.
Their meeting agenda doesn't give very much away. But the focus of the virtual meeting is wide-reaching, with discussion reserved for each of the five guiding questions mapped out by the department. 
The questions are described in this issue paper published late last month. They are, in short:
Public comment comes at the end of each day of conversation. To sign up to speak, send your name and, if applicable, organization to negreghearing@ed.gov no later than noon Eastern time on each meeting day. 
On Tuesday, negotiators focused on questions No. 1 and 2 – how to better support borrowers with outsize balances and better engage borrowers who are eligible for forgiveness but haven’t applied. The discussion was civil, though at times it meandered into territory not technically covered by this neg reg process. Some, for example, focused on the need to ease burdens on parents who took out student loans on behalf of their kids, known as Parent PLUS loans, which are not eligible for most income-driven repayment options. Others highlighted obstacles to participating in the public service loan forgiveness program. 
Four takeaways from the day’s discussion:
The negotiators have to come up with a plan to which every committee member has to agree. If they don’t arrive at a consensus, the Education Department will come up with its own proposal. Either way, there will be another opportunity for the public to comment on what is developed before it’s finalized. Congress will then have the opportunity to review the rule, and has the option of passing a joint resolution to overturn it. 
A final rule must be published by Nov. 1 for it to take effect in July of the following year. This rulemaking schedule is a big reason the Biden administration is so intent on publishing a rule developed under its Education Department. If the process goes according to plan, the earliest borrowers would see forgiveness is summer of 2024. 
When the Supreme Court struck down Biden’s original plan this past summer, it ruled that student loan debt relief could not happen through the president’s executive authorities the way he’d hoped. That means the only viable routes are through federal legislation – which given partisan gridlock is all but impossible – or federal higher education policy changes, a.k.a. neg reg. 
If a rule isn’t finalized through this neg reg series and a Republican wins next year’s presidential election, the chances of broad student loan forgiveness becoming reality are even slimmer.

The first meeting spans over two days, Tuesday and Wednesday, for five hours each – from 10 am to noon Eastern, then 1 pm to 4 pm.
The next meeting is scheduled for Nov. 6-7, and the one after that for Dec. 11-12. Both of the sessions, like the one that kicks off Tuesday, will be virtual and include opportunities for the public to comment. The links to register will be different for the next two sessions.
Biden has a Plan Bfor mass student loan forgiveness. It could be excruciatingly long
Bar Pereg spent the early hours of the morning Saturday glued to her phone, tracking her sisters’ location as they fled from the rockets raining down on Israel. 
The 37-year-old New Yorker initially thought little of the attack. With seven decades of war and conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, rockets aren’t uncommon in the region. But Pereg soon learned from her sisters’ WhatsApp messages that this time, things were different. 
The two sisters decided to risk car rides to a safer location, fearing the situation would take a turn for the worse in their kibbutz near Gaza.
“I asked them to share their location so I could track them, and I just sat there and watched,” Pereg said, noting that they took off around 4:30 a.m. EDT. Once they reached a highway, Pereg alternated 20-minute phone calls with each sister to make sure they were safe and didn’t fall asleep at the wheel. 
“The fact that I could hear their voices, see their location, it was the difference between a complete freakout or crippling fear but with really clear hope,” Pereg said. “It made all the difference.”
People across the United States have turned to communication channels like WhatsApp to get updates from friends and family in Israel amid the war, which has so far led to more than 900 dead in Israel, upward of 680 dead in Gaza and at least 14 dead Americans. Dozens more Israelis and an unknown number of Americans have been taken hostage and are being held in locations across Gaza.
While experts warn that social media sites can be rife with disinformation during crises, they have also become a lifeline for Americans concerned about loved ones thousands of miles away. 
Linda Mildwurf, 52 of Raleigh, North Carolina, has been in constant communication with her 20-year-old daughter through WhatsApp since the conflict began.
Mildwurf’s daughter is a “lone soldier,” a designation in the Israel Defense Forces whose parents do not live in Israel. Mildwurf asked that her daughter not be named to avoid targeted attacks by Hamas militants.
When she's not checking on her daughter and sending encouraging texts, Mildwurf spends her time on WhatsApp finding solace in a lone soldiers' mothers group, where members update each other on the status of their children. 
“Our job is to protect them. They’re our kids. And these are just kids, at the end of the day,” Mildwurf said. “And there's nothing that we can do. Literally, the only thing we have is to be able to talk to them through WhatsApp.”
Itzik Elyahou, 37 of California, was at a mindfulness retreat with limited internet access over the weekend and didn’t learn about the war until Sunday.
When he connected his phone to Wi-Fi, he said he discovered approximately 70 WhatsApp messages from friends and family in Israel. He raced back home after learning about the war and sorted through the news after a “really hard” two-hour drive.
“I didn’t know who was dead or kidnapped. That was super challenging,” he said, adding that his immediate family and close friends are safe. At the retreat, “I was at this peak of the universe, feeling everything is possible. We’re all one, we’re all together. Then you go back to reality.”
Boris Meyerovich, a 33-year-old Israeli living in Austin, Texas, was in Israel last week to visit friends and family. He landed in Texas with his wife and son on Friday and woke up jetlagged in the middle of the night to find notifications flooding his phone from WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram.
“Everywhere, it was chaos. People were asking each other are you good? Are you fine?” he said.  
“Like 9/11 for the U.S., that’s how it feels for me," he added. "It’s horrible. It’s the darkest, darkest days of our lives."
He keeps in contact with his mother “a few times a day” and gets updates from his friends in WhatsApp groups. While Meyerovich said his family has reported rockets flying about their house, they remain safe.
Debbie Secan, a 53-year-old Raleigh, North Carolina, resident who lived in Israel while in her 20s, has been communicating with friends through WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger since the attack started. 
“I’m just grateful that I can send love,” she said. "The one thing I’m getting is that they’re all very scared and shocked.”
Israel-Hamas war:Israel, Gaza and when your social media posts hurt more than help
While social media sites have been able to help connect families amid the crisis, they have also been flooded with misinformation.
False stories have already spread on sites like Facebook and X, formerly Twitter, with users posting old videos or video game clips and passing them off as updates from the Israel-Hamas war.  
“You have to be a bit more careful when you consume content,” said Dina Sadek, a Middle East research fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “Right now, there's widespread misinformation and disinformation.”
Social media to blame?:Online hate surges after Hamas attacks Israel. Why everyone is blaming social media.
The Israel-Hamas war isn’t the first conflict where social media has been used to spread propaganda, but some experts say managing misinformation online today is harder than ever before. 
Developments in artificial intelligence could influence propaganda if the Israel-Hamas war drags on, according to Claire Wardle, co-director of the Information Futures Lab at Brown University, which studies misinformation. 
Wardle also noted that in just the past few months, Elon Musk's X has made it harder to recognize verified journalists and layoffs among tech companies like Google parent company Alphabet and Facebook parent company Meta have reportedly affected teams focused on internet trust and safety.  
“It was always going to be a difficult situation, and then you add on the world's most complex conflict, which is Israel and Palestine and Gaza. And what we're seeing is what we would expect, but it's made so much worse on Twitter, X, in particular, because of the complete breakdown of the lack of verification processes,” Wardle said.
“I don't think the platforms are prepared,” she added. 
There’s a horrific war going on between Israel and Gaza. Many of us have been glued to the nonstop news coverage and social media feed as the horror unfolds before our eyes. The question for all of us is how can we respond in a way that will bring hope and peace as opposed to more bloodshed and persecution.
The two of us have a long history of working with and alongside each other in community organizing and social justice work in and around Chicago. We also just returned home from an absolutely transformative journey in Jerusalem and its surrounding area with a phenomenal interfaith group of community leaders, scholars, artists and others.
Our journey lasted for two weeks. The last day of the trip coincided with horrific violence and attacks inside Israel on Saturday that have led to yet another round of aerial bombardment and an inhumane blockade on Gaza. Our group experienced the direct horror of indiscriminate rockets being fired from Gaza into Israel as we ran for cover with people of all faiths and backgrounds at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport.
Our own fear and the fear of those who were sheltered with us was palpable. We knew that wherever these other travelers were headed, this trauma would be carried with them and have an impact on communities across the globe and geopolitics. We tried to comfort ourselves and others around us as we searched for a safe way home, eventually crossing into Jordan to catch flights back to America.
The stories of ghastly attacks by Hamas are gut-wrenching to watch, and there is nothing in our understanding of our faiths and righteous pursuits for justice that justify such horror. We know that these brutal images and stories bring up deep-seated trauma for the Jewish community and worry and sadness for the many who have been killed, injured and taken captive.
Meanwhile, the carnage and blockade being imposed upon the civilian population in the Gaza Strip by an overwhelming military force is barbaric and inhumane – and yet not often condemned by the world. The attacks on and closure of Gaza will certainly lead to the deaths of innocent children.
While in Jerusalem, our multifaith group had the opportunity to connect to the Jewish traditions of Sukkot (the weeklong fall harvest festival), attend Shabbat dinner, sit through a soaring church service on the Mount of Olives and attend powerful outdoor Friday prayers along the road to Tiberias.  
We leaned into one another’s rich spiritual backgrounds and commitments to justice, mercy and peace by exploring underappreciated connections to this sacred land, and in so doing, tried to forge another path for radical empathy and connection to the stories, hopes and aspirations of those working for and dreaming of more dignified pathways for all people on this land.
Attack timing desecrates our religion:Hamas took advantage of divisions in Israel to start a horrific war targeting civilians
Throughout our journey, we were reminded of the daily humiliation, hardship and injustice experienced by Palestinians living under military occupation in refugee camps and surrounding areas. In Jerusalem, we heard of forced evictions, home demolitions and a widescale system of harassment and abuse that make life unbearable for most Palestinian families struggling to survive.
While none of that justifies the carnage of innocent civilians, it must be understood as the ongoing context in which decades-old Palestinian grievances are being ignored or exploited. 
Now back in Chicago, we know our work will soon return to the issues that connected us before this journey together: social, racial and economic justice and equity in our city and ways to bring faith and other communities together around a larger vision for a more just and equitable Chicago.
Meanwhile, we cannot forget what we experienced together in the Middle East, especially at a time when much of America and news outlets seem to be cheering on Israel’s blockade and bombardment of one of the most densely populated and essentially imprisoned populations in the world. 
We pray for the healthy return for all Israeli children, families and others taken hostage in the Gaza Strip as we pray for the cessation of collective punishment upon innocent Palestinian families.
We call upon our politicians to support an immediate end to the full blockade on Gaza and a humanitarian corridor for relief for families inside Gaza. Among the things we were reminded of by many people of all faiths and backgrounds on this journey is the interconnected and interwoven reality of all our collective experiences, suffering and dreams for justice. 
'Stand with Israel'?:Biden's response to Hamas terror attack was weak. Trump talked about hummus.
We are also concerned about the safety of Muslim and Jewish communities here in the United States as tensions flare in Israel and Gaza. Some parts of both communities are receiving threats at this time.
Palestinian people are not the enemy; Jewish people are not the enemy. The true enemy is any ideology that degrades and diminishes the sacred light resident in all humanity.
We recognize the fear, anger and helplessness so many feel at this precarious and violent time, but our traditions teach us to turn to prayer, loving support of one another, and working for justice and peace as outlets for these feelings and not violence.
We must stand up for the safety and security of everyone. Our hearts break for all who live under the threat of terror and sit under the canopy of hopelessness. We call upon our religious leaders, politicians and communities to stand together for justice and peace and not resort to sloganeering or jingoism at this time.
In a sacred land filled with so much sorrow, death and destruction now, we recall the powerful words of Palestinian American poet Suheir Hammad:
There is death here, and there are promises of more. There is life here. Anyone reading this is breathing, maybe hurting, but breathing for sure. And if there is any light to come, it will shine from the eyes of those who look for peace and justice after the rubble and rhetoric are cleared and the phoenix has risen.
Affirm life. Affirm life. We have got to carry each other now. You are either with life, or against it. Affirm life.
May more of us of all backgrounds dig deep into the highest ideals and practices of our traditions so we can truly radiate the divine light of truth, justice and mercy so desperately needed now in Gaza, in Jerusalem, across this ancient holy land, here in Chicago, and across the globe.

The Gaza Strip, one of the smallest territories in the world, may soon become a bloody battleground as Israeli Defense Forces strike back against Hamas for its brutal, hostage-taking attack on Israel.   
Gaza is at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian hostility, which has existed since the creation of Israel in 1948. The confrontation going on now is another in a long history of Middle Eastern disputes among Israelis, Palestinians, and others.
USA TODAY looks at this tiny Palestinian enclave, its people, and its place in the ongoing conflict.
The Gaza Strip comprises just under 140 square miles of relatively flat coastal plan bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It is central to the conflict involving Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian territories and various regional actors. Urban areas, refugee camps, border crossings and high-risk areas as defined by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs can be seen in the map above.

Gaza's area is slightly greater than twice the size of Washington, D.C. It is home to 2.3 million people in 139 square miles, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Gaza borders Israeli territory on its northeastern and southeastern sides and Egypt to its southwest. To its west, Gaza abuts the Mediterranean Sea.
At least 2.23 million people live in the Gaza Strip, according to the U.N., many of them displaced after leaving or being driven from Israel during its War of Independence and subsequent conflicts. Gaza is often described as one of the world's most densely populated areas, but population density varies across the territory. There are roughly an even number of women and men living there.
With 42,059 people per square mile, Gaza City is the 63rd-most densely inhabited urban region in the world. At least eight Palestinian refugee camps lie in the Gaza Strip and have some of the highest population densities in the world, according to the U.N.
Hamas is the largest Palestinian militant group and has fired rockets from Gaza at Israeli cities in the fighting. It was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and hasand has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2006, then wresting militarily control from another leadership group in 2007. It's committed to the destruction of Israel and is considered a terrorist group by the U.S., the U.K. and other nations.
According to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the socioeconomic situation in Gaza has been in steady decline for more than a decade. Longstanding restrictions on the movement of people and goods to and from Gaza have made living conditions extremely difficult. Israel prevents all access to and from the Gaza Strip by sea and air. Movement of people and goods is restricted to three crossings: Rafah crossing, controlled by Eqypt, and Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings, controlled by Israel.  
Sixty-three percent of the population of Gaza is considered food-insecure, and 81% are living in poverty. Access to clean water and electricity were at crisis levels even before this month's hostilities. The U.N. secretary-general says the blockade and related restrictions contravene international humanitarian law because they target and impose hardship on the civilian population, effectively penalizing them for acts they have not committed.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he will expand Florida sanctions against Iran for its support of terrorist organizations throughout the Mideast while condemning the attack on Israel.
Iran celebrated the attack, which began Saturday, but has denied claims that it supplied Hamas with military aid or intelligence. The U.S. and Israeli governments do not currently have any evidence to support the claim that Iran is behind the attacks, but one U.S. official said Iran is complicit in providing funding, weapons and training to Hamas.
During a Tuesday appearance at a synagogue near Miami, DeSantis condemned the “barbarians” conducting the assault, which has killed more than 1,600 on both sides, while another 150 Israeli soldiers and civilians are being held hostage by Hamas militants. 
“We shall use all available means to choke off money going to the Iranian regime,” DeSantis said at The Shul of Bal Harbour synagogue.

DeSantis said he’ll ask the Florida Legislature to expand the state’s prohibition on investment in Iranian businesses to include such industries as finance, construction, shipping, ports and more. He’d also bar any investment by local governments in Iran. 
Iran is already considered one of the "countries of concern" Florida names in SB 264 that went into effect July 1, 2023. The law prevents officers from those countries from buying farmland or land within 10 miles of a military installation or critical infrastructure in the state.
Here is the full list of countries included in the law:
The law goes further by preventing people "domiciled" in China, with the exception of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, from buying any property in Florida. The law is being challenged in court, but it remains active after a federal judge denied an injunction in August.

DeSantis cited the state’s history of having steered $18 million for security at Jewish day schools in Florida, along with its long-held opposition to boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel for its Palestinian policies. 
The governor also went to The Shul synagogue two years ago to sign legislation authorizing a moment of silence requirement at schools and another advancing a volunteer ambulance service used by conservative Jewish communities.
The Shul is a conservative Chabad-Lubavitch synagogue, whose members sought the legislation.
The governor said Tuesday he has instructed the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and other agencies to be on heightened alert for any anti-Semitic activities that could extend to “fund-raising for Hamas or other terrorist groups.” 
“If you’re doing that in Florida, you’re going to be held accountable,” DeSantis said. 
Also:Florida man hung banners with swastikas, anti-Semitic slogans in Orlando bridge, authorities say
DeSantis on Monday ordered flags at public buildings in Florida lowered to half-staff and the state Capitol lit in blue and white in honor of the at least 900 Israeli civilians and soldiers killed so far. 
DeSantis, whose bid for the Republican presidential nomination is dimming in the long shadow cast by frontrunner Donald Trump, also managed to take swipes at President Biden over the attack on Israel. 
DeSantis criticized Secretary of State Antony Blinken for posting on X a statement calling for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, then deleting it. Blinken later posted that “Israel has the right to defend itself, rescue any hostages, and protect its citizens.” 
DeSantis, though, said “you wonder what they’re doing.” 
“If Israel lay down its arms tomorrow, that would result in the destruction of the Jewish state, we know that,” DeSantis said. “For having the administration do anything other than a unified voice saying that Israel should be able to defend itself and that we support that, was honestly not surprising but it’s still very, very disappointing.”

LAS VEGAS – The Green Bay Packers aren’t a talentless team.
They probably have as much or more talent than two of the three teams that have beaten them this year.
But, boy, are they a bad team.
Their offense is a mess. Their defense can be pretty good but only to a point. They are affected any time one of their starters can’t play because of injury. And they have too many players who just do what they’re told and not whatever it takes to be a difference-maker.

Lior Onaly-Kelsey celebrated their 15th birthday two weeks ago. They also celebrated the end of a years-long battle against Greater Albany Public School District.
A federal jury in Eugene this month awarded them $317,353 in damages, concluding the district had discriminated against Onaly-Kelsey when they were in the third grade and failed to properly respond to harassment and bullying.
At a park near their house, Onaly-Kelsey seems happy and curious, eagerly sharing stories about rock climbing and participating in their current school's robotics club.
Their excitement to be a teen attending a Corvallis high school is a stark difference from their emotions as an Albany elementary school student.
Indigenous land acknowledgments are everywhere.
After taking hold on college campuses, they are recited with growing frequency at schools, sporting events and church services.
They are added as signatures at the end of emails. They are being posted on the websites of museums, libraries, and other institutions as the era of racial reckoning and social justice that has followed the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement and the killing of George Floyd continues to evolve.
They are even yelled at concerts, as reggae artist Nattali Rize did during a recent show in Phoenix, drawing loud applause.
Some of the statements are as brief as a single sentence.
If “I love you” means never having to say you’re sorry, as a particularly saccharine cliche would have it, adding “Grand” to a vehicle’s name means never having to admit the one you’ve been selling was too small.

Be careful what you wish for, Dallas Cowboys.
As fallout lingers from the blowout loss at San Francisco, the Cowboys are so deep into their feelings about the 42-10 result that it’s fair to wonder if they are capable of recovering – physically and mentally.
During his podcast, "The Edge with Micah Parsons," the Cowboys' star linebacker took exception to the "(expletive) Dallas" T-shirt that 49ers tight end George Kittle wore under his jersey as he scorched Dallas for three touchdowns. Kittle revealed his wardrobe accessory on a social media post on Monday.
 "I just feel like he’s making it way more personal than it had to be," Parsons said Tuesday. "Kittle’s my guy, but I'ma say this: laugh now, cry later. We got something for that. If we see them again, just trust."
Trust the Cowboys? No way.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
The Cowboys, 28 years and counting since the franchise’s last whiff of Super Bowl glory, have proven (again) that they cannot be trusted as a legitimate contender. Maybe that changes by January. But that needs to be proven in the flesh as they’ve over-promised so many times before in morphing from America’s Team to America’s Biggest Tease. Such an identity remains intact about now.
At this point, any threats coming from the Cowboys about what they’ll do to the 49ers have zero credibility. Remember, Dallas was supposed to use the prime-time showcase on Sunday night as a measuring stick. And the 49ers basically took that stick and cracked the Cowboys on the butt with it.
The defense that Parsons leads? The Cowboys went to San Francisco with the unit allowing the fewest points in the league, like 10 points per game. They left as the defense that gave up six touchdowns and 421 yards and had a terrible time getting off the field on third downs.
So, again, any promises about what will happen if they see them again would be ill-advised.
Thus, the 49ers are still scoring points in this rout – of which Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said “may be the most humbling game I’ve ever been a part of” after he faltered in yet another big game – with the social media aftermath.
Deebo Samuel, the electric and versatile 49ers receiver, had a pointed response to Parsons’ take:
"It was always personal before the game started," Samuel told Kay Adams on the "Up & Adams" podcast. "42-10, I don’t think you wanna see us again. It might be a little worse."
Ouch. Or touchdown, 49ers.
Can we stick a fork in the Cowboys already and declare that this season is kaput? Maybe not yet. It’s the NFL, with its week-to-week reality checks. Look at what happened to Buffalo, a week after destroying the Dolphins: They went to London to get served up by the Jaguars.
This is not the time of year to draw conclusions about what will happen in January – even though it seems clear that if they stay healthy, the 49ers and Eagles will be major factors. And as long as Patrick Mahomes is in the lineup, the Chiefs have a shot.
Dallas? Perhaps the Cowboys (3-2) peaked with a 40-0 beatdown of the Giants on opening night. A week after handing Bill Belichick the worst margin of defeat in his career, blasting the not-so-good Patriots, 35-3, Mike McCarthy suffered the most decisive loss in his three-plus years as Cowboys coach.
"It’s been a wide range of performance, as wide a range that I could ever recall in a 5-week period," McCarthy said after the debacle on Sunday night.
On paper, the Cowboys are not done yet.
There are 12 games left. Just one of Dallas’ next six opponents – Philadelphia (5-0) – currently has a winning record. A path to get back into the race in the NFC East still exists, given the two matchups looming against the Eagles in November and December. Then again, the Eagles will be just as eager as the 49ers to demonstrate a special kind of animosity toward Dallas.
In any event, the expectation correction for the Cowboys has just happened. After showing that figuratively they don’t belong on the same field with the 49ers, the Cowboys find themselves facing a must-win predicament when meeting the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium on Monday night.
Never mind the subplot of facing a Chargers offense now orchistrated by Kellen Moore, the former Cowboys coordinator. It’s about survival, or at least rebounding to restore some confidence after absorbing so many blows during the humiliating loss on Sunday night.
As Kittle, of all people, pointed out on Sunday night, there’s also a pattern to watch when it comes to what happens after teams play the 49ers. Kittle suggested that there’s a residual effect.
"We’re a violent, physical football team," Kittle said, alluding to the smashmouth style on offense that complements a punishing defense. "That’s the standard of the 49ers. Last year, every team that played us lost the next week."
It’s a striking pattern. Including the playoffs, teams that played the 49ers last season were 0-15 in games the following week. The Chiefs won their next game after facing San Francisco last October, but it came after Kansas City had a bye week. And the Eagles had a bye week following the NFC title game, although it indeed lost in the Super Bowl.
Pittsburgh snapped the “next-week” streak last month. Blown out by the 49ers in Week 1, the Steelers rallied to defeat Cleveland the following week. The next three 49ers opponents, though, followed suit with last season’s pattern and lost the following week.
Now the trend is attached to Dallas’ challenge to get back on track after a grueling loss to the 49ers. 
Tony Pollard, the Cowboys running back limited to 29 rushing yards at San Francisco, was upbeat on Sunday night when assessing how they can rebound.
"Get back to work," Pollard said. "Go back to the lab. You have to prepare. You have to get ready and brush it off. We’ll see this team again, so we have to lock in for the next one."
See the 49ers again? Officially, that’s a maybe for the Cowboys this season.
No, the Cowboys likely can’t achieve the dream of winning a championship without getting past the 49ers. But considering the way San Francisco has owned them in recent years, the Cowboys had better be careful of what they wish for.
NFL power rankings entering Week 6 of the 2023 season (previous rank in parentheses):
1. 49ers (1): What else is there to say about a team that's been in the top spot since the season started? S.F.’s +99 point differential is already 20 better than the next team. Probably have the best defense (though that can be settled at Cleveland on Sunday). Might have the best offense. Stars on basically every unit. And second-year QB Brock Purdy continues to effectively play mistake-free football, his league-leading 123.1 passer rating testament to that.
2. Eagles (3): They're 5-0 in successive seasons for the first time. Next up, the Jets – a team Philadelphia has never lost to in 12 previous meetings. Feels safe to slot the reigning NFC champs at 6-0 and look ahead to their Week 7 date with Miami.
3. Lions (5): For all the focus on rookie Jahmyr Gibbs, it's veteran RB David Montgomery who's fueled a ground game with more rushes than any team in the league save two. Sunday, Montgomery became the first Detroit rusher to top 100 yards in consecutive games since … Kevin Jones in 2004.
4. Chiefs (6): Here's a stat that might surprise you – RB Isiah Pacheco leads Kansas City with 424 yards from scrimmage, nearly double TE Travis Kelce's total (222).
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
5. Bills (2): Just as LB Von Miller returns from the PUP list following last year's knee injury, LB Matt Milano (leg) could be lost for the remainder of this season. Weird as this sounds, Milano might be the more valuable player to Buffalo's defense.
6. Dolphins (7): How fast is Miami? Per Next Gen Stats, the Fins have produced the five top speeds among all plays this season and seven of the top nine. WR Tyreek Hill and RBs De'Von Achane and Raheem Mostert are responsible for them (and WR Jaylen Waddle has also cracked the top 20). Big-play Achane is averaging a ridiculous 12.1 yards per carry and 115.0 rushing yards per game, both figures best in the NFL. But seems likely a knee injury will force veteran Jeff Wilson to spot Achane in the coming weeks.
7. Jaguars (14): The first team to play multiple international games in a season is now the first to win multiple – both coming against teams with winning records. Stay in Europe, Jags – it seems inevitable, and you're apparently better for it.
8. Cowboys (4): Good thing they're not part of the NFC West … even if it would make more sense geographically. In its two defeats (to Arizona and San Francisco), Dallas has lost by a collective 70-26. Worse, the Niners seemed to expose how limited the Mike McCarthy offense might actually be.
9. Steelers (12): They've gained the third-fewest yards in the league and surrendered the third most, the delta more than 600 yards. But 11 takeaways, 17 sacks and just enough clutch plays from QB Kenny Pickett can mask such warts … and propel you to the top of the AFC North.
10. Ravens (8): It's been an uneven start, to say the least, but it's also unusual to play four of five away from home so early in the season – and Baltimore's three-game roadie winds to a conclusion Sunday in London.
11. Rams (9): Sure, they're 2-3, but they've hung tough against the league's top teams, San Francisco and Philadelphia. Appears WRs Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua will complement each other nicely, each getting at least 11 targets Sunday, Kupp's 2023 debut.
12. Seahawks (10): Coming off their bye, they're currently not scheduled to face a team with a winning record until November. Time to make serious hay toward a playoff berth.
13. Browns (13): Semi-eventful bye week with GM Andrew Berry explaining QB Deshaun Watson's last-minute scratch in Cleveland's previous game while defending the trade of obviously capable veteran QB2 Josh Dobbs during preseason.
14. Buccaneers (16): This marks three times in four years that QB Baker Mayfield has won three of his first four starts. His only 4-1 beginning led to a deep playoff run in Cleveland.
15. Saints (20): Great sidebar to Sunday's 34-0 runaway in New England. TE Foster Moreau, a New Orleans native, scored his first TD with the Saints – and first since beating Hodgkin lymphoma during the offseason. Pretty cool story amid the NFL's annual "Crucial Catch" campaign for cancer screening.
16. Falcons (18): If you know anything about the NFL, and running backs in particular, best to appreciate their genius while you can. Thankfully, Bijan Robinson has been putting his on display week in and week out, Sunday's TD catch-and-run a thing of beauty.
17. Colts (17): QB2 Gardner Minshew II may be the league's best reliever, but Indianapolis surely didn't count on him playing 50% of the snaps to this point – a figure that's going to rise as Anthony Richardson's sprained throwing shoulder heals.
18. Texans (11): No matter Sunday's outcome, this will be their best six-game start since 2019. But it would help if Houston would run the ball better after cracking 90 yards just once so far this season.
19. Titans (21): WR DeAndre Hopkins' 100-yard day courtesy of Ryan Tannehill was the 11th time he's topped the century mark with a different quarterback. Get a C-note with two more passers, and Nuk sets a league record … so might be worthy lobbying for playing time for Malik Willis and rookie Will Levis.
20. Chargers (22): Did you know WR Keenan Allen owns the NFL record for most games – three – with at least 15 receptions? With wingman Mike Williams down for the count, wouldn't be a shock if Allen extends that mark before this year is out.
21. Jets (24): Only 12 games into his career, he hardly has enough totes to qualify – but if he did, Breece Hall's 6.3 yards per carry would be a record among RBs. Unfortunately, could be hard to sustain that with OL Alijah Vera-Tucker (Achilles) headed to injured reserve.
22. Bengals (26): They'll only be on the road two more times before December, so maybe the comforts of home are good for QB Joe Burrow's calf and team focus with a brutal upcoming schedule (Seattle, San Francisco, Buffalo) for a Cincinnati club that may finally otherwise be turning the corner.
23. Raiders (28): If they're going to salvage their season and use Monday's win as a catapult, now is the time. The Silver and Black face three one-win teams (Patriots, Bears, Giants) over the next four weeks.
24. Packers (19): No worse way to go into a bye week than off a terrible loss. But Green Bay's next three opponents (Broncos, Vikings, Rams) have a combined four wins, so hopefully a good time for the Pack to get healthy figuratively and literally.
25. Vikings (25): Why is offensive balance often a virtue? Consider one-win Minnesota, which has thrown more passes (204) than any team in the league while attempting the fewest runs (91). However that calculus might have to change with All-Pro Justin Jefferson's hamstring injury forcing him to IR.
26. Bears (32): The Justin Fields-to-DJ Moore Show has sparked Chicago's revival. But look closer, and you'll also note a running game averaging better than 170 yards the past two weeks and some encouraging signs of life on defense at Washington. The schedule also suggests Da Bears could easily be a .500 team from here on out.
27. Commanders (15): Only Denver has surrendered more points than Washington's 160. Only Minnesota has turned it over more times than Washington's 10. Lethal combo.
28. Broncos (29): Naturally, when you crown yourselves with dopey "snowcapped" helmets, another Rocky Mountain meltdown is completely inevitable.
29. Giants (30): S Jason Pinnock's 102-yard pick-six Sunday is the longest play of the season NFL-wide and provided Big Blue's first TD before halftime this season. Some consolation for a team that hasn't run an offensive play with the lead yet and has now been outscored by a league-most 91 points.
30. Cardinals (27): No NFC team is blitzing less frequently – worth wondering if that's the right approach given the way Arizona's D has been torn up the past two weeks.
31. Patriots (23): If the dynasty wasn't already dead, then life support has officially been unplugged. Bill Belichick wants to "start over" after suffering the two worst defeats of his career with an offense that's been shut out of the end zone for 10 consecutive quarters and has turned it over 10 times.
32. Panthers (31): The NFL's only winless team just turned in its worst defensive performance (42 points allowed) of the season. Its reward? A trip to Miami. Woof.

Week 5 in the NFL provided needed perspective.
In all, the slate didn't provide too many stunning outcomes or last-second twists. But four of the top 10 teams in USA TODAY Sports' power rankings suffered a loss this week, and some of the top outfits continued to separate themselves from the pack as they expanded their body of work. Meanwhile, other groups that had missteps in the first few weeks had the chance to start setting things straight − or see their seasons spiral further out of control.
Here's our full rundown of the biggest winners and losers from Week 5 in the NFL:
What's scary about the 5-0 49ers is not solely the manner in which they thoroughly dismantled the Dallas Cowboys in a 42-10 blowout on Sunday night, but rather that it all seemed a little ordinary. That's life as the clearly best team in football after five weeks.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
Still, let's not let one of the most sterling performances of the early season pass by without giving it proper recognition. Brock Purdy once again made everything look easy in the role of distributor, shelling out four touchdown passes, including three to tight end George Kittle. San Francisco managed to outgain Dallas by nearly 225 yards (422-197) and is now one of five teams in league history to score 30+ points in eight consecutive regular-season games. The defense, meanwhile, perplexed Dak Prescott and Co. throughout the contest. With the rest of the October schedule filled by teams at or below .500, it could be some time before we see a meaningful challenge for a group that has tied a franchise record with 15 consecutive wins.
Is it too late for them to offer to take either the Baltimore Ravens' or Tennessee Titans' spot in next week's London tilt to go for the triple? In handling the Buffalo Bills in a 25-20 win after last week's victory over the Atlanta Falcons, the Jaguars became the first NFL team to play consecutive games abroad. Being on the move seems to suit them well, as they are now 3-0 this year away from EverBank Stadium. 
But there were plenty of things Sunday that Jacksonville can take back home to Duval County. Trevor Lawrence pushed past some miscues to establish the electric connection with Calvin Ridley (seven catches, 122 yards) that fans had been hoping to see since this summer. Running back Travis Etienne wore down a gassed defense and ripped off a 35-yard touchdown to help put the game out of reach. And the defense kept Josh Allen off balance with consistent pressure via the blitz. With a manageable schedule before the Week 9 bye, the Jaguars have a chance to create some distance in the AFC South race and set up a favorable outlook for playoff seeding.
Netting one offensive touchdown against what is far and away the league's worst defense is nothing to brag about, but Sunday was about far more than the stats for Hackett and the New York Jets. After Sean Payton opened up to USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell by ripping into Hackett's performance last year as the Denver Broncos' coach, both the Jets offensive coordinator and head coach Robert Saleh seemed to address the hypercritical comments through gritted teeth in recent months. No need to hold back anymore, however, after Sunday's 31-21 win over Denver. Sure, maybe Breece Hall deserved the game ball over Hackett after he rescued the offense with his 72-yard scoring scamper and 177 rushing yards overall. But Hackett can now let the result – as well as the Jets' players and social media team – do all the talking for him.
In the first four weeks of the season, Ridder was a severely limiting factor for the Falcons' burgeoning offense, which averaged a league-worst 156 yards through the air during that span. This week, the second-year signal-caller was far more catalyst than caretaker in a last-second 21-19 comeback win against the Houston Texans.
Ridder completed 28 of 37 attempts for a career-high 329 yards while tallying two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing) to power the offense. Long-awaited connections with his top targets in tight end Kyle Pitts (seven catches, 87 yards) and wide receiver Drake London (six catches, 78 yards) finally materialized. And he deftly navigated the final drive, completing all five of his passes for 44 yards to set up Younghoe Koo for the game-winning 37-yard field goal as time expired. Ridder's standing never seemed to be in question within the Falcons, but this outing gives the offense something to build on.
Maybe dispatching the Arizona Cardinals 34-20 in a get-right game doesn't completely undo the myriad setbacks the team suffered in its first four games, but the Bengals appear to be on a much steadier course now. Burrow finally looked fluid and comfortable, with much of his mobility seemingly having returned after the quarterback was hampered by a calf injury since the start of the season. And just one week after he explained in frustration that he's "always (expletive) open," Chase exploded for 15 catches, 192 yards and three touchdowns. The squeaky receiver gets the targets.
For all the histrionics about Cincinnati's start, the Bengals now stand at 2-3 with their star players seemingly back in a good place. There's still work to be done, but there's no reason to write this team off.
One of the more disappointing developments of September was the steadily building training camp buzz around Pickens – the Pittsburgh Steelers' ultra-promising second-year receiver – fading into a dull hum amid persistent woes plaguing his entire offense. For one week, at least, fans got a glimpse of the dynamic downfield threat that Pickens can be.
Trailing by four with just over two minutes remaining against the Baltimore Ravens, Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett found the 6-3, 200-pound target on a back-shoulder throw for a 21-yard gain. Two plays later, Pickens dusted Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey – who was playing in his first game back after August foot surgery – for a 41-yard go-ahead touchdown in a 17-10 triumph. It's probably not the kind of play that the Steelers faithful can routinely expect from oft-criticized offensive coordinator Matt Canada. But incorporating Pickens more can only help invigorate what has been a languishing attack.
Throughout most of his time with the Cowboys, McCarthy has pounced on opponents with a significant talent deficit, allowing composed offense and opportunistic and highly aggressive defense to take care of overmatched foes. On Sunday, he got a reminder of what it's like to be on the other side of that dynamic.
It's not clear if the Cowboys could have done much differently to have had a semblance of a chance in Sunday night's catastrophic outing against the 49ers. What is apparent: As both as a coach and a play-caller, McCarthy proved to be no match for Kyle Shanahan. Dak Prescott said his three-interception night might be "the most humbling game I've ever been a part of," and McCarthy's avowed commitment to "run the damn ball" produced a team total of 57 yards on 19 carries. In what was clearly designed to be a statement game for the Cowboys after the 49ers ended their playoff hopes in the past two seasons, Dallas was outclassed in almost every facet. What McCarthy can muster might be enough to beat up on the bottom and middle tiers of the NFC, but any notion of the Cowboys beating the 49ers – and potentially the Philadelphia Eagles – on the road in January seems like a distant dream.
Suffering the two most lopsided losses of his career in consecutive weeks has left Bill Belichick and the Patriots in a particularly inauspicious spot. But there's a special indignity in the manner in which New England has dropped to this point, a bespoke misery based on Belichick's specific buttons. At the root of it all is Jones, whose head-scratching pick-six to Tyrann Mathieu in a 34-0 rout by the New Orleans Saints was the quarterback's third of the season and second in as many games. That kind of carelessness is no doubt maddening to a coach who hammers fundamentals and sound ball security. But Belichick is not merely the victim here, as his slew of personnel mistakes over the last few years – as well as his befuddling offensive staffing decisions in 2022 – have severely hampered the third-year passer's development. After pulling Jones late again in Sunday's blowout, Belichick again stood by his starter. But this pairing is looking more tenuous with each week, and Jones might need to find mentorship elsewhere to get his career back on track.
It took a truly multifaceted meltdown for John Harbaugh and Co. to squander what should have been a decisive victory. The formerly maligned receiving corps had a throwback performance in the worst way possible, with Nelson Agholor and Rashod Bateman dropping surefire touchdowns. Lamar Jackson unraveled late in the fourth quarter with an interception that paved the way for Pittsburgh's comeback and a fumble that deflated any hopes for Baltimore's own rally. And prior to all that, a blocked punt for a safety helped spark a Steelers team that had been stagnant. 
The slip-up could prove costly in the long run. The Ravens had a chance to begin pulling away from the pack in the AFC North, but instead they fell into a first-place tie with Pittsburgh. 
Whatever mojo they had from last week's statement win over the Miami Dolphins must not have made it through customs for the overseas showdown with the Jaguars. The offense was imbalanced and error-prone. The defense was trampled for 29 first downs and 196 rushing yards. 
Most worrisome, however, were the mounting injuries. All-Pro linebacker and defensive linchpin Matt Milano is expected to be out for the season with what multiple outlets have reported is a fractured leg and a knee injury, and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones suffered a pectoral injury. On Sunday, Buffalo already started to see the effect of losing top cornerback Tre'Davious White for the year to a torn Achilles, with Jacksonville's receivers too often exploiting an overmatched secondary. If the Bills don't shore things up, this could be a harbinger of the franchise's fate against the AFC's contender class. 
There's still no reason to sound the alarm on a No. 1 pick who's just four starts into his professional career. Still, after the Detroit Lions' 42-24 win over the Carolina Panthers, it's difficult to watch Young operate in this offense without wincing. A highly questionable screen to tight end Ian Thomas that ended with defensive end Aidan Hutchinson snatching the ball in mid-air will spark the most exaggerated reactions, but chalk it up to a good play by a tremendously talented defender. The second of Young's two interceptions, however, was the real cause for concern, as cornerback Jerry Jacobs baited the typically discerning signal-caller into the kind of throw he avoided throughout his college career. The signs are troubling in Carolina, as there's scant support from the offensive line or running game, and the coaching staff seems to be doing Young few favors. While this season appears to be a write-off and one that should solely be measured by Young's development, substantial change might still be required at some point. 
SANTA CLARA, Calif. – George Kittle was sitting on his sofa watching action from across the NFL on Sunday morning when a particular touchdown by a particular player caught his attention. It was a 31-yard score to Detroit Lions rookie tight end Sam LaPorta, off a flea-flicker.
Kittle, the San Francisco 49ers' star tight end, shot a quick text to his position coach, Brian Fleury.
“Dude, they ran our play,” Kittle recalled of his message. “How’d they know?
“He goes, ‘Don’t worry. We’re going to run it better.’ “
Done. Kittle hauled in a 38-yard pass from Brock Purdy off a flea-flicker – Christian McCaffrey-to-Deebo Samuel-to-Purdy-to-Kittle – for the second of his three touchdowns in a 42-10 thrashing of the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night at Levi’s Stadium.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
“Yeah, it’s 10 yards farther out,” Kittle surmised. “So, I guess that counts.”
Noting that he and LaPorta are Hawkeyes, he added, “I’m never upset when two Iowa tight ends are scoring on the same play.”
It was that kind of night for the 49ers (5-0), who remained perfect with their most complete game of the season. While they handled the fundamentals with authority, they were also able to spice it up with the trick play that has been in the playbook for the better part of two years.
Kittle could see the razzle-dazzle coming. The 49ers ran the play during walk-through practices on Wednesday, Friday and again on Saturday.
“Whenever you get something run three times (in practice),” Kittle said, “you’re probably going to run it (in the game).” 
It worked like this: McCaffrey took a handoff toward right tackle, then tossed the football to Samuel, circling back on a reverse. Kittle began the play with a block on the defensive end, then released into his pass route. After Samuel flipped the football to Purdy, the quarterback fired a laser of a throw as Kittle streaked down the sideline.
Of course, the style points for the 49ers came with plenty of substance as they dismantled Dallas in myriad ways.
And you thought the gap between these teams was tight? Not so.
Take the quarterbacking. While Purdy, the NFL’s top-rated passer, tossed a career-high four touchdown passes and didn’t commit a turnover, Dak Prescott had another of those performances that will fuel skepticism about his ability to take the Cowboys to a championship level.
No, it’s not all on Prescott. His running game was feeble. Dallas’ defense couldn’t slow down the 49ers offense. And it was not the night for the Cowboys (3-2) to get into a shootout, unable to even get a first down until the second quarter (they finished with eight). Prescott had three interceptions (14-of-24, 153 yards, 1 TD, 51.6 rating) and was sacked three times.
Surely, the 49ers defense had much to do with Prescott’s troubles. No one exemplified that quite like linebacker Fred Warner. In leading the 49ers with eight tackles (5 solo), Warner notched a sack, forced a fumble with a timely punch-out of the football from the arms of Tony Pollard and intercepted a deflected pass.
Before leaving, Warner maintained that there is no such thing as luck when it comes to big-time performances. By that, he wasn’t dismissing the breaks that teams can capitalize on. Instead, he preached that preparation and skill provide impetus to the breaks.
He demonstrated that with his knack on the turnovers. Then again, it was that kind of a night.
On Saturday night, new 49ers defensive coordinator Steve Wilks told his players that they didn’t realize how good the unit can become. That’s striking when considering how many 49ers defenders remain from the 2019 team that advanced to the Super Bowl.
In any event, there was the sense that they haven’t clicked yet this season after being the NFL’s stingiest defense last season. The latest effort, though, marked a major step. In allowing just the eight first downs and four turnovers, the 49ers controlled Dallas with a 4-for-11 clip on third downs.
And the domination on both sides of the ball was reflected with San Francisco’s 37 minutes of possession.
When did Warner feel it would be that type of night?
“As soon as the offense went down on that first drive and scored, I knew we got them,” he said, referring to the game-opening, 75-yard drive capped with Purdy’s 19-yard TD throw to Kittle. “The way they’re operating right now is unbelievable. I’ve been a part of a lot of good teams since I’ve been here, but the way the offense is playing is unlike anything I’ve seen.
“That right there lets me know as long as the defense is doing our job, we’re always going to have a chance.”
Indeed. Like a chance for a special season.
Standing behind a podium and in front of the state attorney's office prosecuting her, 69-year-old Marsha Ervin held up the voter registration card the state gave her.
And arrested her for.
Less than two weeks before, the Florida woman had instead stood for a mugshot. Police knocked on her door just before 3 a.m. and arrested her for alleged voter fraud.
"When she woke up, she was completely surprised that they were telling her they had warrants for her arrest," said Tallahassee NAACP president Mutaqee Akbar, who's also Ervin's attorney.
"She was reliving a nightmare that she had lived five years ago, because she voted," said Akbar, who stood beside her at the beginning of a Tuesday afternoon press conference.
Ervin had been convicted of aggravated neglect of an elderly person in 2016 and released from prison in 2018. Her probation was supposed to end next month. Until then, she wasn't eligible to vote. But she did. Twice. Ervin says she thought she could.
Akbar and the group standing behind him called the arrest voter intimidation, pointing to all the other people arrested around the state following eligibility confusion. Most of them, like Ervin, are Black.
“For this to happen to her, what it really tells you [is] it can happen to any of us,” said civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who announced Monday evening that he is also representing Ervin. “This [is] about instilling fear in people in our community, to say, 'Well, I don't want to get in any trouble, so I'm not going to come and vote.'"
Akbar, Crump and Ervin were joined by local leaders as well as civil and voting rights organization representatives in the Leon County Courthouse, in Tallahassee.
They called for the state attorney's office behind them, headed by Jack Campbell, to drop the case.
"Ms. Ervin did not have the intent to commit an unlawful act," said Leon County Commissioner Bill Proctor, who sent Campbell a letter earlier in the day. "I believe intent is an element here."
They called on the state to fix the confusion around voting eligibility instead of arresting people for it.
Information from a Leon County Supervisors of Elections public records request shows Ervin had initially registered to vote in the area in 2002 but was removed from the rolls in 2017 because of the felony conviction.
Despite that, court records said she registered to vote in 2020 as a Democrat. The government gave her a voter registration card. She proceeded to cast a ballot in that year's general election and the 2022 primary election.
A year ago, she told a Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigator she believed she could because "she was told she could when she was released from prison" and local TV news stories that "indicated felons could vote." The investigator obtained documents from the Florida Department of Corrections showing that she wasn't provided any information by the prison indicating whether she could or couldn't vote.
"[Ervin said] she would not have voted if she believed it was against the law because she just got out of prison and had begun probation," the records said.
Gov. Ron DeSantis' recently-created Office of Election Crimes and Security had referred Ervin's circumstance to the department, which issued the warrant for her arrest, which was executed in the early morning hours.
In an email, FDLE spokesperson Gretl Plessinger emphasized that the department "has no control over when or how a warrant is served."
The Tallahassee Police Department made the arrest. Spokesperson Alicia Hill said the timing was the result of an officer "proactively searching for wanted people."
DeSantis' Deputy Press Secretary Alex Lanfranconiwrote a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, criticizing a USA TODAY Network Florida story about Ervin's arrest.
"I’m sorry her sleep was disturbed," he said, including a screenshot of an article about her charges. "She served time for neglecting her own mother in horrific conditions. Then after prison, she voted illegally."
Ervin told police that she was the primary caretaker for her mother, 86-year-old Gloria Bourgeois, but that Bourgeois refused to see a doctor due to her religious beliefs.
“We don’t believe in medicine,” Ervin told an officer. “Our religion says God will fix it.”
Bourgeois had rotting flesh and numerous ulcers including one the size of a basketball, court documents said. It wasn’t until Bourgeois started bleeding from her ulcers that Leon County Emergency Medical Services was called, and she died weeks later, in 2015.
Jeremy Redfern, DeSantis' press secretary, sidestepped questions about the fix proposed by attorneys and advocates and instead pointed to grisly details in the police report including how maggots were present on Bourgeois' body and chair.
"This a mere distraction trying to make us not focus on this being about voter intimidation," Crump said in an interview after the press conference. "We're talking about this issue. She wasn't arrested for those things. She was arrested for alleged voter fraud."
Akbar echoed that sentiment in a message to previously incarcerated Floridians.
"Don't be intimidated," Akbar said. "Even when our governor does what he just did and pulls the police report and tries to make her seem like the worst person ever, the state attorney's office gave her a sentence, she did her probation and she had no violations.
"They would rather go and try to distract instead of address the real issues here," he continued. "The fact they still don't have a response is troubling, and it's a signal of what their priorities are."
Many of the people behind the podium Tuesday have tried for years to get the state to do more to alleviate voter confusion.
Ervin is just the the latest Floridian — and the first Leon County resident — to get arrested following apparent confusion over voter eligibility.
Before the 2022 midterm election, DeSantis announced a batch of arrests of people who voted despite having previous murder or sexual offenses. Most of those arrested were Black, were issued voter registration cards and said they thought they were eligible to vote.
The confusion goes back to 2018 when voters approved Amendment 4, which aimed to restore voting rights to 1.4 million people barred because of past felony convictions.
Months later, the legislature passed a bill signed into law by DeSantis to keep hundreds of thousands of felons from becoming eligible to vote until they met all their past legal financial obligations.
Just like it never allowed those with felony murder and sex offenses, the amendment never allowed those to vote before completing their felony probation. Still, people are confused about how the laws apply to them. 
And, under Florida statute, the onus is on the voter to get it right. Voter fraud is a felony offense. But those gathered at the press conference Tuesday said the onus should be on the state.
They urged the state to create a checkbox for Floridians previously convicted of felonies trying to get registration to vote. It would add additional eligibility verification without possible legal consequences in case of errors, they said.
They also called for the state to create a system for voters to easily be able to determine their eligibility.
"It's within the state's capacity to create this database," Proctor said, pointing to other databases the state maintains, like those for licenses. "To keep this intentionally murky and ambivalent and confusing... this is nothing but a literacy exam."
Campbell, whose 2nd Judicial Circuit office is handling Ervin's case, said in an interview last week that local prosecutors had declined to take up voter fraud cases in the past.
"The law concerning elections is both new and has been very confused, and we are taking that into consideration each time we review [a case]," he said.

Attorneys for MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell want to quit his defamation case due to not receiving any payment from Lindell or MyPillow.
Attorneys representing Lindell are asking the courts for permission to quit his case according to court documents. Lindell faces a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit by voting machine companies Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems. Attorney Andrew Parker claims that Lindell owes them millions of dollars he cannot pay back.
Lindell spoke to the Associated Press and confirmed that he does not have enough money to pay the lawyers and understands why they are dropping the case.
Parker wrote to the court that he and his firm cannot afford to represent MyPillow through the rest of the litigation. Parker claims that this would put the firm at a substantial financial risk.
Parker wrote in his fillings that Lindell paid the firm through the end of 2022. However, according to Parker, the payments slowed down in 2023 when fees for litigation increased. In May, the firm received payments over 60 days late and the payment did not meet the total of bills due. In July and August, no payments were made at all.
Lindell and MyPillow were warned by Parker and his firm, Parker Daniels Kibort, that they would have to quit their case if payment was not made.
MyPillow financial troubles:auctioning off hundreds of items after retailers drop product, Mike Lindell says
Lindell has seen much financial trouble this year. Along with the lawsuit against him, many retailers like Walmart discontinued his products after he backed former President Donald Trump's claims about the 2020 election.
In April, Lindell was ordered to pay $5 million to a software engineer for breaching a contract with the engineer. Lindell used data to support his claims that China helped in the 2020 elections and helped President Joe Biden win. This was all part of his "Prove Mike Wrong Challenge" at the "Cyber Symposium" in 2021 located in South Dakota.
Although Mike Lindell plans not to file for bankruptcy, he admits that MyPillow has suffered dramatically.

The company was impacted by Lindell's backing of former President Donald Trump's election fraud claims, for which he is currently fighting off a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit.
Lindell has previously said that MyPillow lost $100 million after his election fraud claims, WCCO reported. His company also lost an arbitration case in April related to election fraud claims, leading to his company, Lindell LLC, being ordered to pay $5 million.
WASHINGTON — House Republicans made a major step toward electing a new speaker on Wednesday, formally nominating as a conference House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.
In an internal secret ballot vote, Scalise beat out his primary rival, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, by a vote of 113-99, according to Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.
"We have a lot of work to do," Scalise said exiting the closed-door meeting where the vote was held. "Not just in the House for the people of this country but we see how dangerous of a world it is and how things can change so quickly."
The conference vote however, is just a sign of approval from House Republicans at large. The House still has to formally elect a new speaker on the House floor, and lawmakers are still free to nominate other candidates. 
Exiting the vote, multiple GOP lawmakers including Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, told reporters they still planned to vote for Jordan on the House floor in a display of the uphill battle Scalise is facing to become speaker.
House Republicans control the lower chamber by a razor-thin majority. Scalise needs 217 votes to be elected speaker and can only afford to lose four votes considering there are 221 House Republicans.
Opposition to Scalise slowly racked up on social media as other Jordan's supporters said they would still vote for the Ohio Republican on the floor.
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said on X, formerly Twitter, said she voted to nominate Jordan in conference and still plans to vote for him on the House floor, citing health concerns with Scalise as he is currently battling blood cancer.
Scalise’s nomination, however, is still a major boost for the Louisiana Republican, who is currently the No. 2 ranking House Republican.
House Republicans could move to hold a speaker election on the floor as early as Wednesday afternoon.
House Democrats are expected to stay out of the process and rally behind House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for the speakership in a show of unity. The onus, they say, is on House Republicans to elect a new speaker. 
Republican presidential candidate Asa Hutchinson told voters about his vision for America's economy, the future of Social Security, the war in Israel and other major issues around the world during a New Hampshire town hall sponsored by the USA Today Network on Tuesday.
But behind the scenes, the former Arkansas governor got more personal.
Donning a navy blue suit and a white shirt, Hutchinson, 72, talked about what’s on his playlist, what books he’s currently reading and his guilty pleasure TV picks.
As he continues his bid for the White House, here’s a closer look at some of Hutchinson’s favorites on the campaign trail.
Amidst the chaos of a GOP primary campaign, Hutchinson shared that he listens to a wide range of music, from country songwriter and singer Johnny Cash − who was born in Arkansas − to "Come Away with Me" singer Norah Jones.
And Hutchinson usually opts for nonfiction reads.
“I love history books,” Hutchinson said. “And I've actually just finished the book on Abraham Lincoln making his five speeches in New Hampshire in 1861 of them being right here in Exeter at the town hall where we stand.”
He’s said he's also reading "Why We're Polarized," a book by Ezra Klein about American's political divides.
“It's a fascinating book as to how we got to this point of division in our country,” Hutchinson said. “I haven't got to the rest of it yet as to how we're going to end that divide, but it's a good study that I'm engaging in.”
Hutchinson said the prequels and the sequel to Yellowstone, a drama focused on a family ranchers in Montana called the Duttons, is his “habit.”
“I always watch it with my daughter's family in Little Rock, so I've got to get back to binge watch the rest of that series,” Hutchinson said.
He said he’s in the middle of watching "1923," a prequel to "Yellowstone" that follows the Dutton family’s ancestors living in Montana during the Great Depression.
“I'm excited about finishing that,” Hutchinson said. 
Hutchinson told USA TODAY that one of his priorities is to lower interest rates on student loans, saying it's important that students are able to afford the next steps in their education.
"President Biden wanted to wipe 'em all out. You can't do that," Hutchinson said. "That's not right. But to lower that interest rate's the right thing that will help students."
When he was in law school, Hutchinson shared that he couldn’t afford to put gas in his car or buy books.
"We've got to lower the cost of gas," Hutchinson said. "That helps your students as well. And then you're always looking ahead as to a job opportunity. You've got to grow the private sector jobs in our country, grow our economy, and that would be a focus of mine as president."
If your satellite and cable TV goes out for more than 24 hours, you would be entitled to a refund under a proposal being introduced by the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday.
The proposal would push cable and satellite providers to give consumers their money back when they fall short on a service, according to a senior FCC official.
Two prominent blackouts this year alone served as a catalyst for the commission’s proposal, the senior official said. The dispute between Charter Communications and Disney, along with Nexstar and DirecTV, that caused millions of customers to lose access to channels, pushed the commission to start looking at solutions for consumers.
What the refunds look like will vary, the official said. They will discuss whether refunds will come in the form of refunded money, credit on bill, or decreased bill for the following month.
In addition to refunds, the commission is proposing a reporting component. Currently, blackouts are reported to the commission voluntarily, which makes it difficult to track how often they occur and by which companies.
Separately the commission addressed issues on broadband oversight in an Oct. 5 fact sheet about the federal government's lack of authority over broadband outages and how it "leaves open a national security loophole." But restoring the commission's oversight with net neutrality rules could help bolster their authority "to require internet service providers to report and fix internet outages" and also inform the public of such outages.

In addition to the dispute between Charter Communications and Disney that led to ESPN channels getting blacked out affecting 15 million subscribers, Nexstar and DirecTV also entered into a two-month blackout beginning in July, after Nexstar pulled their channels from the satellite television provider in July, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The move left 10 million DirectTV customers without local broadcast affiliates, the CW network and the company's upstart cable news channel.
DirecTV put measures in place to grant consumers with refunds, and The Buffalo News also reported that Charter began communicating with customers about a "prorated credit for Disney content" that wasn't available to customers during the blackout.
For now, the commission's proposal is about starting a conversation about refunds before they solicit comments from the public, the senior official said.
Clarifications & Corrections:  An earlier version of this story misstated who is affected by this rule. The story has been updated to reflect the proposed rule affects satellite and cable providers.
The climate change issue is getting critical: Warmer, drier weather could threaten the beer supply.
That's because harvests of hops, a crucial ingredient in beer making, could decline by as much as 18% in Europe by 2050 – and those hops that are harvested may have less of the substances needed to give some beers their distinct character, according to research published Tuesday in Nature Communications.
This predicted decline in hop yield and alpha (acids) content "calls for immediate adaptation measures to stabilize an ever-growing global sector," wrote the researchers from Europe and the U.K.
The researchers studied hop production in the periods of 1971–1994 and 1995–2018 in Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. They found that rising temperatures had shifted the beginning of the hop growing season by 13 days from 1970 to 2018, wrote the study's lead author Martin Mozny of the Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
Since 1995, the average annual hop yields across most of Europe have declined as much as 19%, but had remained stable in the Czech Republic. The earlier ripening also led to a decline in the average content in the hops of the acids that give beers their bitterness – down between 10.5% in Zatce in the Czech Republic and 34.8% in Celje, Slovenia, researchers said.
"The increasingly frequent droughts and heat waves are negatively affecting yields and alpha content in all hop-growing regions of the EU. The only exception is Zatec/Saaz in the Czech Republic, where yields are slightly increasing thanks to the adaptation measures already taken," Mozny told USA TODAY in an email exchange. "Unfortunately, simulations of future developments point to a further decline in both yield and alpha."
Is beer good for your health?:Here's the healthiest option to pick for your next cold one.
The researchers simulated future crops and climate conditions and estimate hop harvests that are 4% to 18% smaller by 2050 and a continued 20% to 31% decline in the acids in the hops needed for bitterness. "Aromatic hops from traditional European regions are the 'spice' that gives the right taste and aroma to the best premium and craft beers around the world," Mozny said. "It is exported to all countries that produce better beers."
Hop production in the U.S. faces similar situations, Mozny said, But beer lovers in the U.S. don't need to start hoarding their favorite quaffs just yet.
U.S. hop producers have been developing hop varieties that are resilient and have continued to increase hop production, said Chuck Skypeck, technical brewing projects director at the Brewers Association, a trade group that represents nearly 6,000 U.S. breweries, most of which get most of their hops from U.S. producers.
And similar work is being done in Europe including at the Hop Research Center in Hüll in Germany, he said. "There's a whole lot of progress being made in this regard," Skypeck said. "I'm not downplaying the challenges, because they are there."
Still, the report's conclusion "feels a little alarmist to me," Skypeck shared. "There's some alarming things in there and I'm not saying I don't believe them. But I think people are already working on these things."
Craft breweries also rely more on aroma hops – used for India pale ales and hazy IPAs – than the styles studied in this report. This year's U.S. hop crop is expected to approach recent record yields, even though hop producers set aside some fields because of a massive back inventory, Skypeck said.

But climate change truly is on brewers' minds across the globe. Last month, Atsushi Katsuki, president and CEO of Japanese beer conglomerate Asahi Group Holdings, told the Financial Times, that global warming could reduce barley crops and hop quality over the next three decades, which could cause a beer shortage. In addition to making Asahi, the company also makes Grolsch, Fuller's and Peroni beers, as well as Pilsner Urquell beers.
“Although with hotter weather the consumption of beer may grow and become an opportunity for us, climate change will have a serious impact,” he said. “There is a risk that we may not be able to produce enough beer.”
Anheuser-Busch InBev, maker of Budweiser and Bud Light, and Danish beer maker Carlsberg have invested in drought-resistant barley strains grown in Africa as a hedge against climate change's effects, Fortune reported.
"One of the side motives of this study was to illustrate how climate change might be important for even those who think it doesn’t matter,” study co-author Miroslav Trnka told CNN. “We are really seeing changes that are affecting things that we value, like the taste of beer. Climate change really can have an effect on it, or at least have an effect on commodities that are critical for production.”
Brewers also face other issues involving water quality and quantity, Skypeck said. "Yes, we're facing a lot of challenges," he said, "but there's really smart people working on those problems."

Since he was young, Christian Yu, better known as DPR IAN, has always dreamed big.
"I was always the one to be very on the edge, very adventurous, and I don't think that's ever disappeared," the 33-year-old says. "I've always liked to imagine a lot."
This imaginative nature has manifested throughout DPR IAN's life, making its mark in his work as a singer-songwriter, director and creative. IAN's latest EP "Dear Insanity...", out now, captures his essence as a storyteller, diving deeper into the expansive universe he creates within his music.
"For me, this whole EP just encompasses a journey into your consciousness," he says.
IAN was born and raised in Australia. Though he is currently based in Los Angeles, IAN is one of several artists under Dream Perfect Regime, or DPR, which based in Seoul, South Korea.
Since its inception, the collective has become known worldwide for its dynamic multimedia work and roster of talent, with IAN serving as its chief director and editor. In 2021, IAN released his debut EP "Moodswings in This Order", followed by his first studio album "Moodswings inTo Order" in 2022.  
IAN's ethos is personified by his creativity. Through his releases, IAN has meticulously constructed his own universe, which he calls "The Other Side."
He has come to represent his mental health through the personas "MITO" and "Mr. Insanity," with the former serving as the "the main attraction" of his discography, says IAN. His second EP "Dear Insanity..." expands the story of MITO and Mr. Insanity, chronicling the artist's introspection.
The seven tracks on "Dear Insanity..." detail IAN's journey as each acts as a "snapshot" into certain moments of his life.
When IAN was a teenager, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This has influenced his creative work, with it serving as an outlet and extension of himself.
"MITO represents my manic lows and Mr. Insanity had to rebuttal that, so representing my manic highs," he said.
He likens this Batman and the Joker.
"You understand the Joker more by looking at Batman and seeing it through his eyes of how he sees the Joker and vice versa," IAN says. He wanted to do the same for MITO and Mr. Insanity, building a foundation between the two.
"For me, it's to have people further understand who MITO is," he says. "I had to show them what he was fighting up against."
Storytelling is a key aspect to IAN's work, whether it be visually or sonically. With this, he opens the door for deeper understanding of his past.
"The deeper you go in, I sometimes feel like there are certain things that you unravel, that you had no idea about," he says.
IAN portrays this unraveling in a fanciful, inventive way with bright visuals, as well as via distinct tones and genres. This underscores the intricate approach of IAN's art. Everything has its link and can be drawn back to an earlier point.
"I've always loved being taken on a journey because essentially that means you're linking so many things," he says. "I thought, 'Why just make a concept that's going to change every single time?'"
IAN hasn't shied away from vulnerability. But he recognizes the responsibility that comes with being open.
Showing the highs means you also have show the lows and IAN is cautious of this. "If you've been vulnerable, you can't always share the goods," he says, adding he remains careful of what he speaks about.
With his work, IAN believes he provides something to relate to. "I don't think what I do solves problems. I think what I do gives people relatability," he said. "It's just that comfort in knowing, 'Oh my artist also feels exactly what I'm feeling.'"
"With my understanding and knowledge of learning as I go, I can also just give my two cents of what I'm discovering," he says.
Over the last year, inflation has been cooling. But from the gas pump to the grocery store, the overall price of living still feels stubbornly high for many Americans.
The Federal Reserve has tried to strike a fragile balance: bring inflation down by raising interest rates, without pushing the economy to the brink.
In August, consumer prices rose 3.7% from a year earlier, up from a 3.2% increase in July. That’s the second straight rise after 12 consecutive declines in annual inflation.
The next consumer price index, or CPI report, will be published on October 12, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The monthly update provides key information on the prices of various consumer goods and services and how much they have risen over the past month and year. The data also gives an idea of whether inflation is slowing again or accelerating.
While it is easy to see and measure those price changes, it is something else to actually understand them. Inflation can impact many things besides costs, such as employment and wages. 
So, what is inflation, and what causes it? 
Ready to retire? How much money do you need and when you should start to save
Inflation is a "generalized rise in prices," said Josh Bivens, the director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C. For example, goods like gas, rent or food can be impacted by inflation. 
"Inflation, though, really is meant to only refer to all goods and services, together, rising in price by some common amount," he explained. 
Inflation can be caused by several factors. The most common is "a macroeconomic excess of spending over the economy's relative ability to produce goods and services," Bivens said. 
In this instance, more people are spending money on goods or services that are not readily available to meet those demands, so producers begin to raise prices.
"If everyone in the economy, tomorrow, decided they weren't going to save any money from their paychecks, and they're just going to spend every last dollar out of the blue, they would all run to the stores and try to buy things," Bivens said. "But, producers haven't produced enough to accommodate that big surge of across-the-board spending. So, you would see prices bid up." 
Another cause of inflation is a lack of producers. If there are not enough workers to produce the demanded good or service, this would lead to an increase in prices as well, Bivens said.
"Labor is the primary component of cost of producing anything," he explained. 
There is also a level of "built-in inflation" within economies, where central banks try to get inflation to hover roughly at a certain level.
In the U.S., the Federal Reserve's target inflation is 2%. This means businesses can increase prices by 2% each year, and it shouldn't impose a cost burden on consumers. Workers can also ask for a 2% wage raise based on these increases, so they can still afford goods and services. 
"That 2% is kind of the built-in inflation; what everyone expects to happen," Bivens said.
Rent inflation:Tenants struggle with rising rent as prices hit all-time highs
CPI stands for the consumer price index. It is a metric used by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to gauge how much the price of consumer goods and services has changed over time.
It can effectively measure inflation in an urban market and give government officials and everyday citizens alike an idea of the health of the overall economy.
The most recent CPI report, released in early August, showed that consumer prices in July rose 3.2% from a year earlier, up from a 3% annual rise in June but far below a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022. Month over month, prices increased a modest 0.2%, similar to June.
In the most basic sense, inflation is measured by comparing the current price of goods and services against their recent history.
This is done by looking at a number of government-released data reports.
The CPI is the most prominent of these metrics. Released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index measures the prices of goods in an urban market, which represents over 90% of the American public.
The CPI looks at a 'fixed basket' of some 80,000 goods and services to come up with these numbers. What gets put in that basket depends on the consumer expenditures survey which polls Americans to determine which goods are important. The importance of those goods then determines their weight in the CPI– for example, the price of something like gasoline, which forms an integral part of many people’s cost of living, will contribute more than other items.
The CPI does not just have one version though.
Another version – the chained consumer price Index for all urban consumers is used to adjust tax brackets. The virtue of the chained CPI is that it takes into account the product substitutions shoppers make, which happens often when prices go up amid inflation. In doing this, it provides a more accurate look at consumer spending and doesn’t overstate inflation.
Inflation can also be measured through the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE). This metric, released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, takes a more holistic view. Rather than calculating the change in prices for goods paid solely out of pocket for consumers, the PCE takes into account all expenses, including health care coverage compensated by insurance or the government.
The PCE is what the Fed uses as its gold standard measure of inflation.
The final piece of the puzzle to factor in is ‘core inflation.’ This is a term used by economists to reflect the rate of inflation, excluding prices for food and energy which are notoriously variable.
Inflation is both good and bad, Bivens said. However if rates of inflation are consistent, positive and low, they can be beneficial, he added. 
"Inflation is sort of greasing the wheels of the labor market," he said. "It is a way to do some adjustments without actually having to cut nominal wages, and the economy just seems to operate better like that."
If inflation goes beyond its target percentage, though, it can cause uncertainty within the market. 
"Whatever your target is, you don't want to go really far above that. You want people to be able to make plans and have a predictable sense of how much prices and wages will rise over the next year," Bivens said.
In order to control inflation, one of the Federal Reserve's main tools is the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. If that rate rises, banks generally pass on their additional cost to customers.
Even though the Fed does not directly control all interest rates in the country, when it raises the fed funds rate, other interest rates eventually follow, including adjustable-rate mortgages, credit cards, home equity lines of credit, and other loans.
Higher rates curb borrowing and spending, cool off an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes.
Whoever is spending most on goods or services can be negatively impacted by inflation. 
For instance, when gas or food prices are inflated, low- and moderate-income families are hurt since they spend a higher share of total income on energy and food, said Bivens. 
Inflation and recession are strongly related, said Bivens. 
High inflation can cause consumers to cut spending and prompt the Fed to raise interest rates - both of which can lead to a downturn. That can result in easing price increases.
"A big rise in the unemployment rate is going to put a lot of downward pressure on inflation," he said. "As the economy slows, inflationary pressures tend to relent." 
A recession isn’t determined by a negative quarter of gross domestic product or even two for that matter. Rather, it’s a significant decline in economic activity resulting from several factors, including high unemployment, a slowdown of goods produced and sold, and wages falling in addition to negative GDP readings.
That’s according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which gives the official ruling on when a U.S. recession starts and ends.
So, inflation could produce a recession, but it is not a definite outcome.
Consumers were rocked by surging food prices last year. In July, the cost of groceries rose 0.3%. This, however, still pushed down the yearly increase to 3.6%.
The price of rice and bread both rose 0.9%, uncooked ground beef increased 1.5% while cookies rose 0.8%.
Chicken and fish prices both fell 1.1%, bacon was down 0.7% and eggs declined 2.2%. This was the fifth straight monthly decrease for eggs after a series of sharp bird flu-related increases, and costs are now down 13.7% over the last year.
Costs to dine out are up 7.1% over the past year.
Much like other aspects of the economy, inflation can cause a raise in prices for rent as well. And in May, housing costs were the biggest contributor to inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
However, increases have somewhat slowed down. Rent went up 0.4% in July but this is less than previous stronger increases. Annually, rent eased to 8%, according to the CPI report.
The consumer price index, or CPI, measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a variety of different consumer goods and services, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Core prices exclude volatile food and energy items and generally provide a better measure of longer-term trends. 
They were up 0.2% in July. This left the annual increase at 4.7%, down just slightly from June’s 4.8% increase and well above the Fed's 2% target.
Baked potatoes are an autumn staple, especially as we make our way into the football and holiday seasons. They make a great party snack or an easy weeknight dinner – you could even try this loaded baked potato skin board or loaded baked potato soup to impress your friends and family. 
Here are a few quick tricks to keep up your sleeve for the next time you’re craving a baked potato, including cooking temperatures to know and topping ideas to try.
Internal temperature isn’t as crucial for a potato as it is for meat, but you’ll still want a baked potato to reach around 210 degrees, the Idaho Potato Commission advises. If you want to let residual heat do the rest of the cooking for you, you can take your potato out of the oven after it reaches 185 degrees. 
But beyond exact temperatures, the best way to tell if a potato is done is by sticking a fork or knife into it – if it slides through the potato easily, it’s good to go. 
This will take between 45 minutes to an hour in a 400-degree oven, according to the Food Network. If you want to speed up the cooking process, throw the potato in the microwave for a few minutes before placing it in the oven. 
You can also bake a potato in the air fryer by setting it to 375 degrees and letting your potato cook for 50 minutes to an hour.
Boiling your potatoes?:How long it takes to cook those spuds properly
Making a baked potato is simple, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Here’s how to do it right:
How you top your baked potato is up to you: Are you content with salt, pepper and sour cream? Do you load up your baked potato with chives and bacon? Butter or olive oil is essential, but the possibilities are endless with other toppings. Here are a few favorites to consider:
Microwaving a potato to baked perfection is a serious time saver, but some people are die-hard oven enthusiasts. First, poke holes in your potato with a fork to release the steam, then cover it with oil and seasonings. Place your potato in a microwave-safe dish and cook for 5 minutes in the microwave for one potato, or 5 to 7 minutes for two potatoes. Flip the potatoes and cook them for another 3 minutes, the Food Network suggests.

"Going gray" is something few men try to prevent and some are even proud of. For women, it's often a different story. While only 31% of men pluck their gray hairs when they first start appearing, 82% of women do the same, per one clinical survey. Women also turn to dyeing or coloring their hair more often than men do − with approximately half of them doing so, according to one report. 
Such efforts are often employed to hide signs of getting older, but age isn't always the only factor at play. While most people start getting gray hairs in their mid to late 30s, others do so much earlier, showing that age alone isn't the culprit behind hair changing color. Experts weigh in on what these other causes are and whether there's anything you can do to keep the gray hairs at bay. 
Graying hair is what happens when color-producing cells in the body stop producing a natural pigment known as melanin. That happens naturally with age in most people, but graying and premature graying can also happen due to "some environmental triggers," explains Shari Lipner, MD, an associate professor of clinical dermatology at the Weill Cornell Medical Center. 
Such triggers include overexposure to sunlight as UV rays can create free radicals that damage the cells that give hair its color. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause premature graying in some people. "And smokers compared to non-smokers have increased risk of graying," adds Lipner. The National Institutes of Health has published a report showing that stress can also cause one's hair to prematurely turn gray. 
More common than environmental or behavioral factors though, the timing of one's hair turning gray "is mostly driven by genetics," says Angela Lamb, MD, a dermatologist at Mount Sinai in New York City. "Sure, you might be the first person in your family that you know that is going gray prematurely," she explains, "but the research supports that it is predominately genetically driven." 
Once that change begins taking place many are eager to know: can you stop it from progressing or even prevent it from happening altogether? The short answer is no, not absolutely. But as the saying goes, "though you can't change your genes, you can change your behavior," and certain behaviors can impact both the timing and the degree to which one's hair turns gray. 
"Some things that can help include maintaining a balanced diet, ensuring adequate intake of essential vitamins and minerals − particularly vitamin B12 and folic acid − and refraining from smoking," advises Michelle Henry, MD, a board certified and Harvard trained dermatologist. 
She also recommends limiting exposure to environmental pollutants that can cause oxidative stress or create free radicals "that could harm hair or accelerate graying."
Others want to know if it's possible to get their color back after their hair has already turned gray. There again, it depends on a couple of factors. If one's hair changing color is the result of genes, than there's nothing you can do to permanently reverse the change. But if it's been caused by nutritional deficiencies or a medical condition like thyroid disease, improving such deficiencies or treating the condition may prove helpful. 
And when stress is the culprit, research shows and the experts say there may be a window of opportunity to reverse the graying hair once it first starts turning if stress levels are brought back down. In such cases, "manage stress through relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga," suggests Henry. 
If stress isn't the issue, however, or if you're worried that you're graying earlier than family members your age or because of something else, a conversation with your doctor may be in order. "If premature graying concerns you," Henry advises, "consult your healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions."

So California’s liberal Gov. Gavin Newsom has enacted a law known as the “Skittles Ban,” and it cruelly attacks the four thing all righteous Americans hold dear: brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and Red Dye 3.
The law will ban the sale, distribution and production of these traditionally delicious food additives, which are used in thousands of products we eagerly put in our mouths. Newsom’s attack on tastiness doesn’t actually impact Skittles – thank the rainbow! – because brave candy advocates persuaded lawmakers to exclude titanium dioxide from the list of banned additives. (Everyone knows it’s the titanium dioxide that gives Skittles their flavorful pop.)
Still, the four unjustly targeted additives will require producers of certain food-like comestibles to change recipes by 2027 if they want to sell their products in the most-populated state in the country.
What kind of newfangled communism is this? And since when does a governor have the power to tell me when and where I can guzzle brominated vegetable oil?
Here are a few of the endangered products: Peeps; Pez; Fruit By the Foot; Hostess Ding Dongs; Brach’s Candy Corn; and Yoo-hoo Strawberry Drink.
THAT’S MY FOOD PYRAMID, YOU NANNY STATE MONSTER!!!
Like most sensible patriots, I start each day pounding five seasonally appropriate Peeps and washing the marshmallow-like goop down with a bottle of Strawberry Yoo-hoo, the only beverage bold enough to look like milk while actually being water and high-fructose corn syrup.
It’s delicious, nutritious-ish and causes an insulin surge that keeps the walls of my arteries in a state of constant inflammation or, as I like to call it, “readiness.”
But Newsom and his propylparaben police want to rob me of that breakfast tradition. Am I now supposed to start eating fruit NOT by the foot?!?
Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, said in a statement about the new California law: “We’ve known for years that the toxic chemicals banned under California’s landmark new law pose serious risks to our health. By keeping these dangerous chemicals out of food sold in the state, this groundbreaking law will protect Californians and encourage manufacturers to make food safer for everyone.”
Well, lah-di-dah. I don’t recall asking for government protection from chemicals I don’t understand and didn’t technically realize I’m eating. But if you think knowing that Red Dye 3 has been found to cause cancer in animals and has been banned from use in cosmetics for more than three decades would stop me from making my annual Thanksgiving candy corn casserole, think again.
Look, California, if I’m Hoover-ing Pez into my pie-hole and washing Ding Dongs down with Yoo-hoo, as is my God-given right as a corn-syrup-based citizen of this world, I’ve pretty much committed to a ride-or-die lifestyle.
So you’re going to have to pry the Peeps and potassium bromate from my cold, dead, Red-Dye-3-stained hands. Which, according to these actuarial tables, you should be able to do in about a month and a half.

There’s a horrific war going on between Israel and Gaza. Many of us have been glued to the nonstop news coverage and social media feed as the horror unfolds before our eyes. The question for all of us is how can we respond in a way that will bring hope and peace as opposed to more bloodshed and persecution.
The two of us have a long history of working with and alongside each other in community organizing and social justice work in and around Chicago. We also just returned home from an absolutely transformative journey in Jerusalem and its surrounding area with a phenomenal interfaith group of community leaders, scholars, artists and others.
Our journey lasted for two weeks. The last day of the trip coincided with horrific violence and attacks inside Israel on Saturday that have led to yet another round of aerial bombardment and an inhumane blockade on Gaza. Our group experienced the direct horror of indiscriminate rockets being fired from Gaza into Israel as we ran for cover with people of all faiths and backgrounds at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport.
Our own fear and the fear of those who were sheltered with us was palpable. We knew that wherever these other travelers were headed, this trauma would be carried with them and have an impact on communities across the globe and geopolitics. We tried to comfort ourselves and others around us as we searched for a safe way home, eventually crossing into Jordan to catch flights back to America.
The stories of ghastly attacks by Hamas are gut-wrenching to watch, and there is nothing in our understanding of our faiths and righteous pursuits for justice that justify such horror. We know that these brutal images and stories bring up deep-seated trauma for the Jewish community and worry and sadness for the many who have been killed, injured and taken captive.
Meanwhile, the carnage and blockade being imposed upon the civilian population in the Gaza Strip by an overwhelming military force is barbaric and inhumane – and yet not often condemned by the world. The attacks on and closure of Gaza will certainly lead to the deaths of innocent children.
While in Jerusalem, our multifaith group had the opportunity to connect to the Jewish traditions of Sukkot (the weeklong fall harvest festival), attend Shabbat dinner, sit through a soaring church service on the Mount of Olives and attend powerful outdoor Friday prayers along the road to Tiberias.  
We leaned into one another’s rich spiritual backgrounds and commitments to justice, mercy and peace by exploring underappreciated connections to this sacred land, and in so doing, tried to forge another path for radical empathy and connection to the stories, hopes and aspirations of those working for and dreaming of more dignified pathways for all people on this land.
Attack timing desecrates our religion:Hamas took advantage of divisions in Israel to start a horrific war targeting civilians
Throughout our journey, we were reminded of the daily humiliation, hardship and injustice experienced by Palestinians living under military occupation in refugee camps and surrounding areas. In Jerusalem, we heard of forced evictions, home demolitions and a widescale system of harassment and abuse that make life unbearable for most Palestinian families struggling to survive.
While none of that justifies the carnage of innocent civilians, it must be understood as the ongoing context in which decades-old Palestinian grievances are being ignored or exploited. 
Now back in Chicago, we know our work will soon return to the issues that connected us before this journey together: social, racial and economic justice and equity in our city and ways to bring faith and other communities together around a larger vision for a more just and equitable Chicago.
Meanwhile, we cannot forget what we experienced together in the Middle East, especially at a time when much of America and news outlets seem to be cheering on Israel’s blockade and bombardment of one of the most densely populated and essentially imprisoned populations in the world. 
We pray for the healthy return for all Israeli children, families and others taken hostage in the Gaza Strip as we pray for the cessation of collective punishment upon innocent Palestinian families.
We call upon our politicians to support an immediate end to the full blockade on Gaza and a humanitarian corridor for relief for families inside Gaza. Among the things we were reminded of by many people of all faiths and backgrounds on this journey is the interconnected and interwoven reality of all our collective experiences, suffering and dreams for justice. 
'Stand with Israel'?:Biden's response to Hamas terror attack was weak. Trump talked about hummus.
We are also concerned about the safety of Muslim and Jewish communities here in the United States as tensions flare in Israel and Gaza. Some parts of both communities are receiving threats at this time.
Palestinian people are not the enemy; Jewish people are not the enemy. The true enemy is any ideology that degrades and diminishes the sacred light resident in all humanity.
We recognize the fear, anger and helplessness so many feel at this precarious and violent time, but our traditions teach us to turn to prayer, loving support of one another, and working for justice and peace as outlets for these feelings and not violence.
We must stand up for the safety and security of everyone. Our hearts break for all who live under the threat of terror and sit under the canopy of hopelessness. We call upon our religious leaders, politicians and communities to stand together for justice and peace and not resort to sloganeering or jingoism at this time.
In a sacred land filled with so much sorrow, death and destruction now, we recall the powerful words of Palestinian American poet Suheir Hammad:
There is death here, and there are promises of more. There is life here. Anyone reading this is breathing, maybe hurting, but breathing for sure. And if there is any light to come, it will shine from the eyes of those who look for peace and justice after the rubble and rhetoric are cleared and the phoenix has risen.
Affirm life. Affirm life. We have got to carry each other now. You are either with life, or against it. Affirm life.
May more of us of all backgrounds dig deep into the highest ideals and practices of our traditions so we can truly radiate the divine light of truth, justice and mercy so desperately needed now in Gaza, in Jerusalem, across this ancient holy land, here in Chicago, and across the globe.

On the high seas hundreds of miles north of the Falkland Islands, a group of Western reporters boarded a Chinese fishing ship where deckhands pulled them into a dark hallway begging for help, saying they were being held against their will.
While in Uruguay, these same reporters unearthed data showing that for much of the past decade, one dead body per month has been dropped off fishing ships, mostly Chinese, on the docks in Montevideo, often with signs of severe neglect or abuse.
For four years, these reporters, from a journalism organization called The Outlaw Ocean Project, quietly, always with captains’ permission, boarded Chinese fishing ships on the high seas and in national waters all over the world – near the Galapagos Islands, near the sea border with North Korea, along the coast of West Africa – for the sake of inspecting working conditions.
They uncovered myriad abuses, including forced labor, debt bondage, wage withholding, excessive working hours, physical abuse, passport confiscation, the denial of medical care and even deaths.
And the abuse doesn’t end at sea.
As part of this same investigation, reporters discovered something even bigger and darker in China’s seafood processing plants. By using cellphone footage from inside the plants, deploying secret surveillance at factories and ports, and mining company documents and trade data, the reporters found that much of the seafood being exported to the United States and Europe from Chinese plants is processed by Uyghur workers – a highly repressed minority population whom the Chinese government detains in “reeducation” camps and forces to work in factories throughout the country.
The United States forbids the import of products made with forced labor, and it has specific laws prohibiting the import of any products made using Uyghur labor.

These new revelations about the global seafood industry have serious implications for American consumers and policymakers because more than 80% of the seafood consumed by Americans is imported, and the largest portion of that is caught by Chinese ships or processed in China's factories.
By some estimates, half of the fish sticks served in American public schools are processed in China. Fish tainted by Chinese forced labor is even showing up in military base cafeterias, federal prison canteens and veterans homes’ dining halls, paid for by federal and state tax dollars. Such seafood also lines the shelves of our major grocery stores, including Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Walmart.
Even fish marketed as “locally caught” is tainted by these labor and human rights problems associated with China because much of the fish coming out of U.S. waters and onto U.S.-flagged ships is frozen, sent to China for processing, refrozen and shipped back to America. Like fish from Chinese vessels, many of the workers processing U.S.-caught seafood are also Uyghurs under state-sponsored forced labor regimes, meaning importation of this catch is also in clear violation of U.S. law.
I escaped modern slavery.Wouldn't you want to know if I made your shirt?
Solving problems within seafood industry supply chains is not easy because fishing ships are far from shore, almost always in motion, tough to spot-check, flagged to other nations and crewed mostly by poorer people from the global south who do these jobs with no contracts.
Even so, there are things that we as American consumers can do:
First, contact your senators and representatives and ask them whether the fish bought by the U.S. government with your tax dollars is caught and processed in China. If it is, insist that they consider sourcing it from local fishers and processors. Demand that these lawmakers also impose stricter rules on U.S. importers of seafood, requiring them to collect necessary information about the conditions on these foreign ships and factories.
Second, look at this interactive graphic by The Outlaw Ocean Project to find information about which seafood brands have responded to these reports by plainly stating that until China allows real oversight of its ships and factories, they will ensure that none of their seafood comes from China. Avoid buying fish from companies that ignore these reports or fail to disclose the origin and processing location of their product.
Finally, support organizations that do the hard work of revealing such crimes and those working to prevent forced labor and human rights abuses all over the world. A handful of nonprofit groups monitor not just whether the oceans are running out of fish but also the human rights concerns among the 50 million people who work at sea.
In the past several decades, other industries like those that produce so-called sweatshop garments, blood diamonds and fair-trade coffee have had their moment of reckoning. That time has come for seafood.

Our politics is dominated by the old. Although the median age of the rest of America is 38.9 years, the median age in the U.S. Senate is 65.3 and is 57.8 years in the House of Representatives.
And, of course, the two front-runners for the 2024 presidential race, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, would be well into their 80s before one or the other left the Oval Office in 2029.
Unlike some of my fellow Generation Z, which spans from 1997 to 2012, I generally favor older people in office. Young people are still forming their belief systems and learning how to accomplish the things they want to achieve. Older politicians have more life experience and are less likely to radically change their ideological positions in response to a new crisis. 
Career politicians tend to understand how the system works and the mechanisms to get things done. While I get frustrated by a Congress predominantly made up of out-of-touch older people, inexperience is never a virtue, as much as young perspectives might be valued. 
However, as always, there is a line. As could be seen with recently deceased Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who was 90, access to the high-level medical care that our federal elected leaders enjoy can mitigate the effects of aging for only so long. 
Trump or Reagan?Gen Z conservatives must decide what values we really hold true.
Aging also raises the risk of cognitive decline. A recent poll from NewsNation/Decision Desk found that 74% of voters were “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” with how Biden's cognitive health might affect a second term. And 59% of those polled said the same about Trump.
Partisan politics may skew those numbers, but if more than half the country is concerned about our leading presidential candidates' competency to serve as commander in chief, we ought to take note.
Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and one of Trump's rivals for the GOP presidential nomination, has proposed requiring a mental competency test for candidates older than 75.
Biden, to no one's surprise, has scoffed at the idea. Trump, on the other hand, endorsed it but doubted the practicality of requiring a mental competency test: “A lot of people say it’s not constitutional to do it.”
Yet, polling suggests that 76% of Americans strongly or somewhat support such tests for politicians. 
Trump and GOP turn off young voters.Here's how Republicans can appeal to them.
While mental competency tests would be a good thing, declining physical health also needs to be taken into account. It may not be polite to say it, but the older the president, the higher the risk that America's commander in chief will die while still in office.
With all the chaos in the nation and the world now, America shouldn't risk the uncertainty and dangers of a sudden transfer of presidential power.
I think neither Biden nor Trump should serve a second term because of their character and policy positions. Their age is just another important factor for why voters need strong (and younger) alternative candidates.
Sadly, voters appear too locked into partisan combativeness to fairly evaluate whether Biden and Trump are capable of serving effectively as octogenarians.

When most people quip that they're "a bit OCD," they probably just mean they're a neat freak.
For Howie Mandel, it means much more than that.
Though the "America's Got Talent" judge didn't receive his diagnosis for obsessive-compulsive disorder until his 40s, the 67-year-old says OCD has had a profound impact on most of his life. This OCD Awareness Week, which falls the second week of October, the comedian is partnering with NOCD, a company that provides video-based OCD therapy.
"The word 'suffer' is not even strong enough," he says of his experience with the condition, while speaking over a Zoom call from Las Vegas. "If I think I got a germ on my hand, I can't think or hear anything else. I just have to get that germ off my hand. Then I'll wash my hand ... stay in the bathroom, keep wiping, miss a birthday party, miss an important event, miss work, and I just can't move past this brick wall of horror."
That wall has gotten easier to deal with, he says, thanks to a combination of medication and therapy, but it's still something that's always there − which is why it's frustrating when well-meaning fans claim they experience the same thing, when it's clear they don't.
"A day doesn't go by (without someone saying,) 'I know you're a germaphobe. I got a bit of OCD too.' Well, I don't know that you do," he says. "There's a big difference between being a little bit neurotic and having OCD."
OCD is not that uncommon:Understand the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder.
According to Mayo Clinic, OCD involves persistent patterns of unwanted thoughts and fears, known as obsessions, that lead to repetitive behaviors, known as compulsions.
Ignoring or trying to stop these obsessions can worsen anxiety, so people with OCD are often driven to perform compulsive acts in an attempt to relieve stress. These patterns can be time-consuming, interfere with day-to-day life and cause significant impairment.
Examples of obsessions include fear of contamination and intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way. Compulsions can take the form of hand-washing to the point of damaging the skin, repeatedly checking the stove to make sure it's off or counting in certain patterns.
Mandel recalls how his OCD once drove him to check if a door was locked so many times it occupied him for hours.
"It's just this vicious, dark circle, and it makes you... unproductive, unhappy, depressed," he says. "Sometimes there are people that have this that even end in suicide. It's not a good thing, but the deal is that there is an answer, and there is help out there."

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic proved especially difficult for Mandel, who has an OCD-driven fear of germs and famously avoids shaking hands.
The comedian says he coped with the added stress the way he has with many hardships: with humor. Still, he says, laughter can only do so much.
"For somebody who was triggered by germs, COVID was not helpful," he says. "I made a lot of jokes, and people do make jokes, like, 'You were right, Howie. Now everybody needs to wear gloves and wash their hands.' But it was hell and really affected me, and I'm traumatized by it."
There has been at least one upside to the pandemic for Mandel: his podcast "Howie Mandel Does Stuff," which he co-hosts with his daughter Jackelyn Shultz, who's also diagnosed with OCD. He says the two got the idea for the project while finding ways to cope with the stress of early COVID life.

On the "AGT" set, Mandel says his fellow judges are understanding and considerate of his condition and everyone he works with is "so open about mental health." He also praised his co-judge Simon Cowell, 64, for recently revealing he went to therapy to help treat his depression.
Mandel says it can be especially intimidating for people of his and Cowell's generation to share their mental health struggles.
He hopes that by speaking out he can help change that stigma.
"I think the younger you are, the easier it is to be open about mental health," he says. "The reason I have that strength is because not only me, not only my daughter, but a lot of people are expanding the ability to share."
Plus, he says, the more people acknowledge their imperfections, the more they acknowledge their humanity.
"I feel broken ... but I don't know what perfection is," he says. "I don't know what fixed is. I think that everybody's got a little break in them. I think some people aren't aware of it. ... I don't know that there is perfection with anybody."

After a week-long hospital stay, 61-year-old Chef Michael Chiarello died last week of a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Neither his doctors nor his family know what caused the fatal reaction, according to a representative for Chiarello’s company Gruppo Chiarello. Even so, his death sheds light on how serious and unpredictable allergies of all kinds can be. 
People can be allergic to nearly anything, including pollen, dust, food, insect stings, animal dander, latex, mold and medications. For many, all it takes is a tiny crumb or speck of an allergen to spark a reaction that can quickly become life-threatening if not treated properly or efficiently. 
Anaphylactic reactions most commonly occur to foods, insect stings, medications and latex, according to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology. 
Chiarello’s family was not aware of any allergies he might have had, the Gruppo Chiarello representative told USA TODAY, but he was home when the reaction occurred. It’s still unknown what he was doing at the time of his reaction. 
Allergy experts say that Chiarello’s death serves as a critical reminder that even mild reactions can turn fatal, food labels are awfully confusing and adults can develop new allergies.
Although most allergies arise in childhood, millions of adults go on to develop one or multiple allergies, even to foods or substances that they have safely been exposed to hundreds of times before, said Dr. Rita Kachru, an allergist with UCLA Health in Santa Monica, California. 
At least 15% of people with food allergies are first diagnosed in adulthood, according to the nonprofit FARE (Food Allergy Research & Education) — a phenomenon that some researchers deem “an important emerging health problem.” 
Allergies sometimes emerge in adulthood because it takes time for your immune system to develop antibodies called immunoglobulin E against a certain food or substance that it mistakenly labels as dangerous, Kachru said. These antibodies “fight” the food by releasing histamine and other chemicals that trigger allergic reaction symptoms such as an itchy throat, difficulty breathing or vomiting. 
More often, adults may experience a reaction to an allergen they outgrew during childhood but for various reasons, such as changes in their immune system or environment, the allergy comes back, Kachru said. 
The surprise factor for many adult-onset allergies increases risks for anaphylaxis because people may not have an EpiPen (an auto-injector that releases epinephrine into the body to reduce inflammation) on hand. 
Even mild allergies can lead to anaphylaxis, which is impossible to predict, Kachru said, because a reaction is dependent on exposure dose, the state of your immune system and prior history of allergic reactions. 
“If all it took was one cashew to trigger an allergic reaction the first time, the next time it may only take half a cashew to mount a response, which could be more severe,” Kachru said, “because you have primed your immune system by exposing yourself to it more.”
Treatment with an EpiPen is crucial in these scenarios, Kachru said, which should begin within seconds of the start of a reaction: “Inflammation is like a snowball — once it starts, it’s really hard to control.”
If an allergic reaction symptom worsens over time, if you develop two or more mild symptoms or if you have one severe symptom (like your throat closes up), use an EpiPen and then go to the hospital, Kachru said. Anaphylaxis can sometimes recur up to four hours after appropriate treatment in what's called a biphasic reaction.
Otherwise, treat a mild symptom with an antihistamine like Benadryl and stay cool, as heat can trigger a greater histamine response.

Never assume a food or object is free of your allergen, experts say, as it can lurk in the most unexpected places. 
Fish and shellfish, for example, are sometimes dipped in milk to reduce their fishy odor, putting those with dairy allergies at risk. Cross-contact — when an allergen is accidentally transferred from one food to another — can also expose you to an allergen, despite signs indicating a food is safe for you to eat. 
Don't shy away from asking people, whether it's your doctor, restaurant staff, whoever cooked your dinner, for details about how they prepared a meal, if cross-contact may have occurred, or what tools they'll be using on or around you, experts say. Doing so will help protect you from exposure to your allergen.
Federal laws require that the nine most common allergens —  milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, shellfish and sesame — must be labeled on packaged foods sold in the U.S.
However, nuances in these laws allow certain ingredients outside of these top nine allergens to stay under the radar, according to FARE. Some may not be listed on the label, but instead may be covered by vague terms such as “natural flavorings.” Milk, Kachru says, could be listed as casein or lactalbumin, which are the proteins that make up milk. 
There are also no laws requiring manufacturers to say whether a product may have come into contact with a specific allergen. 
This is why you have to read food labels every time you buy a product. When in doubt, call the manufacturer directly to better understand what products contain or may contain.
With their chiseled physiques, Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White are ready to step into the ring in the trailer for the upcoming wrestling drama titled "The Iron Claw."
A24, the entertainment company that distributed 2022's Oscar-winning "Everything Everywhere All at Once," released a first look at the long-anticipated film, which chronicles the real-life rise of the Von Erich wrestling dynasty in the 1980s.
“We’re here to restore justice to the Wrestling Federation that our father built with his own two hands,” a voice is heard saying in the trailer, referencing the World Wide Wrestling Federation that eventually became known as the WWE. “The hands that were passed down to us. The hands that will deliver the Iron Claw to you.”

Written and directed by Sean Durkin ("The Nest,") the sports biopic tells the true story of the Von Erich brothers who rose to prominence in the '80s amid the competitive world of professional wrestling.
As the oldest and middle brothers, the bowl-cut-sporting Kevin (Efron) and Kerry (Allen White) are their father's favorites. But it's a status that comes with strings attached, as they're subjected to his harsh demands and vain ambitions as he pushes them to further the legacy he created as a wrestler in his own right two decades ago.

Though Efron, 35, rose to fame as the star of Disney's "High School Musical," his role in "The Iron Claw" marks his latest dramatic turn after last year starring alongside Russell Crowe in the Vietnam War film "The Greatest Beer Run Ever." In 2019, Efron also portrayed infamous serial killer Ted Bundy in Netflix's “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile."
Allen White, 32, meanwhile, rose to prominence in 11 seasons of Showtime’s “Shameless" before his breakout role as a young Chicago chef in "The Bear," FX and Hulu's Emmy-nominated restaurant comedy-drama.
"The Iron Claw" also stars Harris Dickinson ("Where the Crawdads Sing") and Stanley Simons as two of the other three Von Erich brothers. Holt McCallany ("Mindhunter") portrays the boys' domineering father, Jack Adkisson Sr., known professionally as Fritz Von Erich.
Emmy nominee Maura Tierney ("Liar Liar") portrays matriarch Doris Von Erich, and Lily James ("Pam & Tommy") is featured as Kevin’s wife Pam Adkisson.
"The Von Erichs will forever be the greatest family in the history of wrestling," their father proclaims at the end of the trailer.

Five women have sued Tim Ballard, founder of an anti-child-trafficking group whose life story inspired the surprise summer hit "Sound of Freedom," alleging he sexually manipulated, abused and harassed them on overseas trips designed to catch child sex traffickers.
Ballard’s work with Operation Underground Railroad is the underpinning of the movie, which resonated with conservative moviegoers and earned more than $183 million at the North American box office. He recently resigned from the group amid sexual abuse and harassment allegations, which he has denied.
Ballard, a former Homeland Security officer whose prominence as an opponent of child sex trafficking got him invited to the White House under President Donald Trump, was appointed to a White House anti-human-trafficking board in 2019.
Tim Ballard:'Sound of Freedom' subject speaks out on sexual misconduct allegations
The complaints against Ballard center on a “couple’s ruse” he allegedly engaged in with women from Operation Underground Railroad who posed as his wife to fool child sex traffickers into thinking he was a legitimate client, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in Utah state court.
Operation Underground Railroad and The Spear Fund, an anti-human trafficking group where Ballard now serves as a senior adviser, were named as defendants alongside Ballard in the lawsuit. O.U.R. did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.
Mark L. Eisenhut, an attorney for The Spear Fund, issued the following statement to NBC News: "The Spear Fund did not exist during the time of the alleged conduct and had nothing to do with it. Mr. Ballard vehemently denies the allegations brought by these unnamed women. He looks forward to vindicating his name in the courts where evidence, and not unsubstantiated accusations in the media, decides the outcome."
Before the lawsuit, Ballard denied the accusations in a statement provided to USA TODAY by The Spear Fund.
“As with all of the assaults on my character and integrity over many years, the latest tabloid-driven sexual allegations are false," Ballard said in the statement last month. "They are baseless inventions designed to destroy me and the movement we have built to end the trafficking and exploitation of vulnerable children."
The ruse began with Ballard and women in the organization taking cross-country trips to “practice” their “sexual chemistry” with tantric yoga, couple’s massages with escorts and performing lap dances on Ballard, the lawsuit claims.
While promotional materials portrayed the group’s overseas missions as “paramilitary drop-ins to arrest traffickers and rescue children,” they mostly involved “going to strip clubs and massage parlors across the world, after flying first class to get there, and staying at five-star hotels, on boats, and at VRBOs (vacation rentals by owner) across the globe,” the lawsuit alleges.
Multiple women allege they were eventually subjected to “coerced sexual contact,” including “several sexual acts with the exception of actual penetration, in various states of undress,” the lawsuit says.
Even in private, the lawsuit alleges: “Ballard would claim that he and his female partner had to maintain the appearance of a romantic relationship at all times in case suspicious traffickers might be surveilling them at any moment.”
The women, who filed the lawsuit under pseudonyms, allege Ballard meanwhile used his membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and connection to church leaders to persuade them what he was doing was just for the good of children in need of help.
Ballard said a high-ranking church leader, M. Russell Ballard, no relation, gave him permission to use the ruse “as long as there was no sexual intercourse or kissing.” The church in a September statement condemned Tim Ballard for “unauthorized use” of the church leader’s name for personal advantage and “activity regarded as morally unacceptable.”
Tim Ballard claimed a passage in the Book of Mormon justified performing “unconventional” tasks, the lawsuit alleges.
Tim Ballard, who has said he was considering running for the U.S. Senate, has blamed political opponents for the sexual allegations against him.

A new spooky show looking to give a modern twist on the writings of a classic American writer and poet is coming to Netflix.
It's called "The Fall of the House of Usher" and it's inspired by an 1839 Edgar Allen Poe short story with the same name.
Mike Flanagan is the creative mind behind it as well as other shows like "The Haunting of Hill House," "The Midnight Club" and "The Haunting of Bly Manor".
"The Fall of the House of Usher" will pull characters and themes from other Poe stories as well and will give them a "modern spin with some truly lush visuals and genuine scares," according to an article on Tudum, Netflix's official companion site.
According to Netflix, "The Fall of the House of Usher" is an eight-episode horror-drama limited series that focuses on Roderick and Madeline Usher, siblings who have built Fortunato Pharmaceuticals into an "empire of wealth, privilege and power."
"Past secrets come to light when the heirs to the Usher dynasty start dying at the hands of a mysterious woman from their youth," the synopsis reads.
Flanagan is set to direct four episodes while Michael Fimognari will helm the other four.
Here's everything you need to know about the new Netflix series.
BEST SCARY MOVIES:Looking for a good horror movie to creep you out? We ranked the century's best scary films
According to Netflix, all eight episodes of the series will be released at 3 a.m. ET on Thursday, Oct. 12.
If you're a fan of Flanagan's past projects, you'll see some familiar faces in "The Fall of the House of Usher," such as Carla Gugino, Henry Thomas, Samantha Sloyan, Rahul Kohli and Kate Siegel.
The show also stars Bruce Greenwood, Mary McDonnell, Willa Fitzgerald, Mark Hamill, Carl Lumbly, Crystal Balint, Kyliegh Curran and Ruth Codd, among others.
Netflix released a trailer for the show on Sept. 12.
Thanks to Mark Stoops, coaches now have a new excuse for getting humiliated by No. 1 Georgia: fan cheapness.
In response to Kentucky's 38-point loss to Georgia, Stoops asked fans to throw money at the problem. When a caller on Stoops' radio show asked the veteran coach about Kentucky's flops against elite teams, Stoops got defensive. Later, he cited Georgia's NIL riches and suggested UK fans should cough up more cash.
Never mind that Stoops’ teams went 0-8 against Georgia, with an average margin of defeat of 22.4 points, before NIL deals became permissible in 2021. He's now 0-11 against the Bulldogs.
Want to catch Georgia? Spend, baby, spend.
"I just encourage (fans) to donate more, because that’s what those teams are doing," Stoops said. "I can promise you, Georgia, they bought some pretty good players. You’re allowed to these days, and we could use some help. That’s what they look like, you know what I mean, when you have 85 of them. So, I encourage anybody that’s disgruntled to pony up some more (money)."
STAY UP-TO-DATE: Subscribe to our Sports newsletter for exclusive content
Here we have a $9 million coach whose improvement plan centers on fans writing a blank check so Kentucky can go on a shopping spree. Why bother employing a coach? Put a fundraising extraordinaire in charge of this operation.
Stoops’ comments came off as defensive blame-shifting, but his excuse also is somewhat clever, because it can’t be disproven.
We can speculate as to what Georgia quarterback Carson Beck earns in NIL, compared to Kentucky’s Devin Leary. We don't know for sure. NIL deals are not subject to public disclosure.
Undeniably, Georgia enjoys advantages over Kentucky. What coach wouldn’t want to recruit a home state as talent-rich as Georgia’s, while facing little instate competition? With or without NIL, Georgia’s realities position the Bulldogs to succeed at a higher level than Kentucky.
Still, Stoops and his team bear some responsibility for this hammering. In another defensive moment during his radio show, Stoops rhetorically asked whether fans would prefer to return to 2012, the final season before his arrival. No Kentucky fan should want that. Stoops raised Kentucky’s bar, making performances like Saturday’s objectionable. That's the price of success.
Own the loss, and go beat No. 25 Missouri this week at Kroger Field.
In one breath, Stoops deemed UK's performance against Georgia unacceptable. In the next, he laid it at the feet of NIL.
The extent to which NIL factored into a 38-point loss can’t be verified, making it a handy excuse.
We can guess that Georgia’s NIL collective enjoys more football riches than Kentucky’s, but these collectives that collect booster- and fan-donated dollars are not subject to financial disclosure.
I know how much revenue Georgia athletics ($203 million) generated in 2022, compared to Kentucky ($159 million). Those are figures that must be disclosed annually to the NCAA. Those revenues do not reflect NIL funding, though. The amount of cash each collective has piled inside its NIL vaults is not public record.  
Also, there’s little accountability for collectives and coaches who are poor stewards of NIL funds. Say a collective blew $250,000 in an NIL deal to a player who becomes a bust. Tough to hold anyone accountable for a deal shrouded in mystery.
Meanwhile, Stoops asks fans to prime the pump. Fill the war chest.
And when Kentucky loses to Georgia again next year? Spend some more.
I sympathize with Stoops. Succeeding at Kentucky isn’t easy, but that didn’t start with NIL. Kentucky hasn’t beaten Georgia since 2009.
Thanks to NIL, though, when a coach suffers a humiliating result, he can reposition blame on the fans. Convince fans their cheapness contributed to this debacle.
Who can prove Stoops is wrong, or that NIL didn’t factor in, when we don’t know Georgia's average NIL deal compared to Kentucky’s?
College football coaches know no shame when asking fans for more money.
Coaches, and to a greater extent athletics directors, have long doubled as glorified panhandlers. They’d convince donors that State U’s poor team couldn’t possibly compete with the fellas from Rival U unless the fat cats ponied up to fund facilities that challenged the Taj Mahal as a wonder of the world.
Now, at least, the panhandling extends to milking donors to bankroll the players behind this lucrative enterprise.
“No excuses,” Stoops said repeatedly during his radio show.
Then, Stoops played the pauper and held out his hand.

Be careful what you wish for, Dallas Cowboys.
As fallout lingers from the blowout loss at San Francisco, the Cowboys are so deep into their feelings about the 42-10 result that it’s fair to wonder if they are capable of recovering – physically and mentally.
During his podcast, "The Edge with Micah Parsons," the Cowboys' star linebacker took exception to the "(expletive) Dallas" T-shirt that 49ers tight end George Kittle wore under his jersey as he scorched Dallas for three touchdowns. Kittle revealed his wardrobe accessory on a social media post on Monday.
 "I just feel like he’s making it way more personal than it had to be," Parsons said Tuesday. "Kittle’s my guy, but I'ma say this: laugh now, cry later. We got something for that. If we see them again, just trust."
Trust the Cowboys? No way.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
The Cowboys, 28 years and counting since the franchise’s last whiff of Super Bowl glory, have proven (again) that they cannot be trusted as a legitimate contender. Maybe that changes by January. But that needs to be proven in the flesh as they’ve over-promised so many times before in morphing from America’s Team to America’s Biggest Tease. Such an identity remains intact about now.
At this point, any threats coming from the Cowboys about what they’ll do to the 49ers have zero credibility. Remember, Dallas was supposed to use the prime-time showcase on Sunday night as a measuring stick. And the 49ers basically took that stick and cracked the Cowboys on the butt with it.
The defense that Parsons leads? The Cowboys went to San Francisco with the unit allowing the fewest points in the league, like 10 points per game. They left as the defense that gave up six touchdowns and 421 yards and had a terrible time getting off the field on third downs.
So, again, any promises about what will happen if they see them again would be ill-advised.
Thus, the 49ers are still scoring points in this rout – of which Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said “may be the most humbling game I’ve ever been a part of” after he faltered in yet another big game – with the social media aftermath.
Deebo Samuel, the electric and versatile 49ers receiver, had a pointed response to Parsons’ take:
"It was always personal before the game started," Samuel told Kay Adams on the "Up & Adams" podcast. "42-10, I don’t think you wanna see us again. It might be a little worse."
Ouch. Or touchdown, 49ers.
Can we stick a fork in the Cowboys already and declare that this season is kaput? Maybe not yet. It’s the NFL, with its week-to-week reality checks. Look at what happened to Buffalo, a week after destroying the Dolphins: They went to London to get served up by the Jaguars.
This is not the time of year to draw conclusions about what will happen in January – even though it seems clear that if they stay healthy, the 49ers and Eagles will be major factors. And as long as Patrick Mahomes is in the lineup, the Chiefs have a shot.
Dallas? Perhaps the Cowboys (3-2) peaked with a 40-0 beatdown of the Giants on opening night. A week after handing Bill Belichick the worst margin of defeat in his career, blasting the not-so-good Patriots, 35-3, Mike McCarthy suffered the most decisive loss in his three-plus years as Cowboys coach.
"It’s been a wide range of performance, as wide a range that I could ever recall in a 5-week period," McCarthy said after the debacle on Sunday night.
On paper, the Cowboys are not done yet.
There are 12 games left. Just one of Dallas’ next six opponents – Philadelphia (5-0) – currently has a winning record. A path to get back into the race in the NFC East still exists, given the two matchups looming against the Eagles in November and December. Then again, the Eagles will be just as eager as the 49ers to demonstrate a special kind of animosity toward Dallas.
In any event, the expectation correction for the Cowboys has just happened. After showing that figuratively they don’t belong on the same field with the 49ers, the Cowboys find themselves facing a must-win predicament when meeting the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium on Monday night.
Never mind the subplot of facing a Chargers offense now orchistrated by Kellen Moore, the former Cowboys coordinator. It’s about survival, or at least rebounding to restore some confidence after absorbing so many blows during the humiliating loss on Sunday night.
As Kittle, of all people, pointed out on Sunday night, there’s also a pattern to watch when it comes to what happens after teams play the 49ers. Kittle suggested that there’s a residual effect.
"We’re a violent, physical football team," Kittle said, alluding to the smashmouth style on offense that complements a punishing defense. "That’s the standard of the 49ers. Last year, every team that played us lost the next week."
It’s a striking pattern. Including the playoffs, teams that played the 49ers last season were 0-15 in games the following week. The Chiefs won their next game after facing San Francisco last October, but it came after Kansas City had a bye week. And the Eagles had a bye week following the NFC title game, although it indeed lost in the Super Bowl.
Pittsburgh snapped the “next-week” streak last month. Blown out by the 49ers in Week 1, the Steelers rallied to defeat Cleveland the following week. The next three 49ers opponents, though, followed suit with last season’s pattern and lost the following week.
Now the trend is attached to Dallas’ challenge to get back on track after a grueling loss to the 49ers. 
Tony Pollard, the Cowboys running back limited to 29 rushing yards at San Francisco, was upbeat on Sunday night when assessing how they can rebound.
"Get back to work," Pollard said. "Go back to the lab. You have to prepare. You have to get ready and brush it off. We’ll see this team again, so we have to lock in for the next one."
See the 49ers again? Officially, that’s a maybe for the Cowboys this season.
No, the Cowboys likely can’t achieve the dream of winning a championship without getting past the 49ers. But considering the way San Francisco has owned them in recent years, the Cowboys had better be careful of what they wish for.
LeBron James, in a video that went viral last week, shrieked when asked for his reaction to being the oldest player in the NBA. Now James, the 38-year-old Los Angeles Lakers star, is getting feedback from a player who can relate to his situation.
Her name is Pat Conner, who at 91 is the oldest active player in the Granny Basketball League.
"Yeah, I’m a little bit older than LeBron," Conner told USA TODAY Sports, and of being the oldest player in her league, she said, "It’s a huge honor."
What can an NBA superstar learn from a 5-2, white-haired woman who played eight years for the Kansas Tornadoes, now plays for the ICT AeroBelles in Wichita, Kansas, and shoots free throws underhanded?
Well, James has talked about extending his career long enough to play with his oldest son, 19-year-old Bronny. Conner has shown how it can be done, playing alongside her 64-year-old daughter, Debbie, and occasionally with her 59-year-old daughter, Becky. (She has four more children, 14 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.)
"She has no fear," Debbie said.
With amusement, Pat Conner added, "A lot of people do not know how old I am when I’m on the court and they play me like I’m a 60-year-old, and I kind of chuckle to myself because I think, 'Oh, they really think I’m a threat, and I’m 91 years old.' "
Conner texted video of herself making a free throw Granny-style. Then she texted video of herself making a hook shot.
"I’d send you a dunk shot, but it’s not allowed in the GBL," she texted, followed by a laughing emoji.
The Granny Basketball League was founded in 2005, two years after James’ rookie season with the NBA. The minimum age is 50, and the league features 450 players and 42 teams in 10 states.
Unlike James, Conner was not a five-star recruit coming out of high school.
"They wouldn’t let us play in high school," she said.
James graced the cover of Sports Illustrated in high school. While he went straight to the NBA, Conner took a different route.
She said she got her start playing basketball in the intramural league at Kansas University and once scored 38 points. Unlike her enthusiasm, her scoring output has dropped in Granny Basketball League, which plays six-on-six,
The court is divided into three sections, with two forwards and two guards on either end and two players in the center area, and Conner has played every position.
LeBron became the oldest player in the league July 28. That’s when Udonis Haslem, 43, announced his retirement after 20 NBA seasons.
Of course, James, who will turn 39 in December, isn’t just the league’s elder stateman. He’s one of its best players, coming off a season during which he was ninth in scoring (28.9 points per game), 19th in assists (6.8 assists per game) and 34th in rebounding (8.3 rebounds per game).  He also made his 19th consecutive All-Star Game and led the Lakers to the Western Conference Finals.
Asked about his longevity, James said it stems in part from "understanding if you want to be great at something, you’ve got to put in the work."
Texted Conner, "LeBron is the MAN!! And I would like to see him shoot a Granny Shot from the 3-point line.''
Like LeBron, Conner values hard work.
"As a side note," she texted, "I did walk/run the 50 (meter) and 100 (meter) events in September at Kansas Senior Games." She also said she started doing CrossFit in August and punctuated the revelation with a flexed bicep emoji.
After the Lakers got swept by the Denver Nuggets in the the Western Conference Finals last season, James said he would consider retirement. On his decision to return for a 21st season, James said, "I feel like I got a lot more in the tank to give."
Said Conner, "My goal is to play until I’m 100 and still be on the court."
By text message she added, "I say to the youngins just keep your mind active, stay on the court playing the game we all love and give it all you've got!!"
Any advice for a youngin like LeBron James?
"Keep playing as long as you can," she said.
Mary Lou Retton, one of the greatest names in U.S. Olympic history, “has a very rare form of pneumonia and is fighting for her life,” according to her daughter McKenna Kelley’s Instagram story.
“She is not able to breathe on her own. She’s been in the ICU for over a week now," Kelley wrote.
According to Kelley's post, which appeared Tuesday afternoon, the family is accepting donations at *spotfund.
Retton, who won the women’s gymnastics individual all-around gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, is 55.
Kelley, who was a gymnast at Louisiana State University, did not immediately respond to messages left by USA TODAY Sports.
Who is Mary Lou Retton? Everything to know about the American gymnastics icon
Retton became the first American woman to win the Olympic all-around title when she captivated the audience in Los Angeles. As one of the breakout stars of the 1984 Summer Games, Retton also won a silver medal on the vault, bronze in the uneven bars and floor exercise, and helped lead the United States to a silver medal in the team competition.
The West Virginia native was honored that year on a famous Wheaties cereal box and later appeared as herself on a number of TV shows as well as in the motion picures, "Scrooged" and "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult." In the fall of 2018, Retton competed in season 27 of "Dancing With the Stars."

UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay.
Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports.
Their partnership should have been a force for good. Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.
The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.
Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.
But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.
According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.
“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”
In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”
“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”
Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.
The stakes are high for everyone.
Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.
Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.
Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.
Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.
“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”
USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.
Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.
For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.
Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.
For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.
“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”
Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.
Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.
At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.
By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.
Tucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.
Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline
Tucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.
Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.
Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.
Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.
During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.
They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.
In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”
It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.
Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.
Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.
They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.
Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.
By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.
Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.
Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”
Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.
Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.
Twelve days later came the call.
Tracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.
According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.
“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”
Tracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”
She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.
“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”
Tracy said she thought to herself, "Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it." In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”
When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.
Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.
Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.
At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.
Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.
When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.
Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.
Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”
Tucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.
The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.
Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.
She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.
Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.
“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”
The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.
A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.
Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.
Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.
Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.
Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.
Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.
“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.
Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.
Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.
Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.
Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.
They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.
“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”
Michigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.
The case would go forward.
Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22.
He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.
For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.
Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.
An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.
Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.
During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”
Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.
“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”
Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.
Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.
Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.
Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.
At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.
Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.
Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”
Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.
One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.
A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”
“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”

On a sunny Thursday morning, Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker strolled through tomato fields at a farm in Immokalee, Florida, toured its processing plants and loaded baskets of bright green fruit into a truck. 
It was a private event thrown by the school to promote its migrant student services program, which provides financial aid and support to farmworkers seeking college degrees. After the April 28, 2022, tour, disclosed in records obtained by USA TODAY this week, Tucker met with community leaders and alumni.
That night, Tucker would make the now-infamous phone call from his hotel room in nearby Naples, during which he is accused of masturbating and making unwanted sexual comments to Brenda Tracy, a prominent rape survivor and activist he had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence.
Yet, when Tucker met with the university’s outside investigator in March for his interview in the sexual harassment case against him, he insisted the trip was not work-related – a claim the investigator would disprove in her report.
It’s just one example of Tucker failing to keep his story straight at the most consequential moment of his career. 
With his job, reputation and the roughly $80 million left on his contract at stake, Tucker repeatedly made false statements to the investigator and misled her about basic facts, such as his location during the phone call and the date it occurred, a USA TODAY review of more than 1,200 pages of case documents found. 
The investigator, Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, and the news organization both obtained documents and witness statements that discredit key aspects of Tucker’s version of events. 
Michigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sept. 10, hours after Tracy went public for the first time with her story in USA TODAY. On Monday, the school informed Tucker it plans to fire him for cause based on the conduct he had admitted to and the embarrassment he had caused the school. 
Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivor
Although Tucker denied sexually harassing Tracy, he acknowledged masturbating on the call, saying he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex.” Tracy said Tucker’s romantic interest in her was completely one-sided and that she had tried to set boundaries multiple times during their yearlong business partnership.
Per his contract, Tucker has until Tuesday to make a case for keeping his job. Regardless, a formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated school policies against sexual harassment and exploitation is expected to proceed on Oct. 5 and 6. 
Since his suspension, Tucker has issued multiple public statements defending himself, attacking Tracy and accusing Veidlinger of bias. He accused the school of conducting a “sham” hearing and having “ulterior motives.” Yet even in these written statements, the central details of his story changed entirely.
Tucker, who previously hung up on a reporter who called him on his cellphone asking about the case, did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. His attorney, Jennifer Belveal, has not responded to phone calls and emails. Tracy declined to comment for this story.
In the absence of eyewitnesses or recordings, sexual harassment cases usually boil down to whose account is more credible, said Elizabeth Abdnour, a Lansing-based attorney and former Michigan State Title IX investigator who has taken part in dozens of campus cases.
“It’s very, very unusual that you would have some outside piece of evidence that would give you a clear decision,” Abdnour said. “Very often you’re weighing credibility based on little bits and pieces of information.” 
In multiple cases she has worked, Abdnour said the respondents lost because they were found to have a greater propensity for lying than the complainants. The hearing officer must determine how much weight to give Tucker’s false and conflicting statements, Abdnour said, and they could sway the case in Tracy’s favor.
“I believe a fact finder could assess these pieces of evidence about credibility and make a determination that Brenda is more credible than Mel,” she said. “In my experience, a clear sign of a lack of credibility is generally taken very seriously.”
By the time Tucker met with Veidlinger for his interview, he had had months to prepare.
The school had informed him of Tracy’s complaint on Dec. 22, the day after she filed it. Veidlinger had interviewed Tracy and all six of her witnesses by the end of January. Tucker was the only holdout.
Rather than tell his side of the story right away, Tucker and his attorney spent three months trying to stop the investigation, case documents show. They wrote legal arguments urging Michigan State to drop the case and twice approached Tracy’s attorney proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no, and the school pressed forward.
On March 22, the day of his interview, Tucker sent Veidlinger a seven-page written account of his interactions with Tracy and lists of their “currently existing” text message and call history, which he said his legal team had compiled. Only a handful of text messages remained; he and Tracy both told the investigator they had deleted their texts with each other in the months after the April 2022 phone call.
In his interview, which lasted 3 ½ hours, Tucker questioned whether Tracy had mixed up the date of the call. He said he recalled being at his home in East Lansing when it occurred, but his own records showed that he had been in Florida on April 28, attending a charity function that was “absolutely not a University-sponsored event.”
His seven-page account told a different story – that he had called her while he was “alone in a hotel room.”
Veidlinger does not appear to have asked Tucker about the discrepancy, based on case documents. But by then she knew what he told her in the interview was untrue: she had already obtained records proving he had not been home in East Lansing.
An expense report he had submitted to the university for reimbursement of his hotel and meals shows Tucker flew to Naples, Florida, to attend a golf fundraiser hosted by The Greg H. Montgomery Jr. Foundation for Ultimate Growth, which raises awareness for suicide prevention. It showed he stayed at the Hilton from April 27 to 29, that the trip’s purpose was “administrative” and that it did not involve personal travel. He had flown there on a donor’s private plane.
The trip is when Tucker toured the farm in Immokalee to help promote Michigan State’s College Assistance Migrant Program. The event was titled “Working to make dreams a reality,” according to an agenda obtained from the university by USA TODAY through a public records request. The agenda features Tucker’s name prominently. Tucker posted photos from the tour on his Twitter account.
That Tucker was on a university-sponsored work trip during the incident was a contributing factor in the university’s determination that it had jurisdiction to investigate, the investigation report shows. 
Tucker’s lists of calls and text messages also were missing an important detail: They did not show any communication with Tracy on April 28. He acknowledged in the interview, however, that he had not reviewed the lists before submitting them and that they may have been incomplete.
Tracy, meanwhile, had already provided Veidlinger with her official cellphone records from Sprint that confirmed the date of their call: April 28.
Tucker and Tracy did not speak in the three months after the April 28 call.
Meanwhile, their assistants were planning Tracy’s third visit to campus – an in-person training with coaches and players scheduled for July 25.
Tucker canceled that training three days before, the investigation report shows. When Tracy spoke to him by phone on Aug. 2 seeking to find out why, she would tell the investigator in her interview that Tucker insinuated he would harm her career if she spoke about his conduct. He never rescheduled her visit, and they never spoke again.
The cancellation became a key focus of the investigator – one of a series of alleged incidents that taken together would meet the definition of sexual harassment, which can include pressuring someone into engaging in sexual behavior for an employment benefit and threatening that rejecting such behavior will carry a negative consequence.
“Reported allegations that a University employee is engaging in misconduct within the vendor-vendee relationship for which they are the decision-maker, and/or impeding in such a services relationship based on a quid-pro-quo sexual harassment allegation, is within a University sponsored program or activity,” Veidlinger wrote in the report, so school policy covered it.
Tucker tried to distance himself from the cancellation in a public statement on Sept. 11, the day after Michigan State suspended him without pay.
“I never cancelled any presentation,” he wrote. “Given a personnel change and scheduling challenges as football season approached, we merely postponed it until January 2023. She chose to file her complaint instead of proceeding with the training.”
But that statement contradicts what he told the investigator. When Veidlinger asked in his March interview if he had a role in canceling Tracy’s visit, Tucker said, “Yes, absolutely I did,” the report shows, and that he did not recall any discussions about rescheduling Tracy for January. Such timing would not make sense, he added, because most of his new players would not yet be on campus. 
Tucker also told the investigator why he canceled the visit, blaming it on a scheduling conflict. He said he had recently hired a mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, who needed to implement his new program on short notice. There was limited time in fall camp, Tucker said, and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” the players. He said he decided to yield the time to Newman.
Veidlinger, however, would later obtain records showing Newman did not meet with the team on July 25, the day of Tracy’s planned visit. He had been meeting with them weekly since June 6, the records showed but held no meetings between July 15 and July 28.
One of Tucker’s assistants, who is a witness in the case, also told the investigator that Tucker asked him via text message to cancel it. He said he was never instructed to reschedule. 
In his interview, Tucker told Veidlinger that his relationship with Tracy frayed after the April 2022 phone call – not because of the incident, but because of information he learned after that caused him not to trust her.
According to Tucker, an associate of his had told him over the summer that Tracy’s assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, had been gossiping about Tucker’s marriage, telling others it was “on the rocks.” Tucker said he was “devastated” because he had confided in Tracy about his marital problems, and he believed she had discussed them with Alvarado.
Tucker confronted Tracy about the alleged gossiping during the Aug. 2 phone call, they both told the investigator. Tracy said he berated and bullied her, repeatedly saying he could not trust her. She said she told him she did not know what he was talking about.
Alvarado – who was killed in a car crash in June – would deny discussing Tucker’s marriage with anyone in her January interview with Veidlinger. 
During the Aug. 2 call, Tracy said she pressed Tucker to identify his source – the associate. She told Veidlinger she believed Tucker had made it up as a pretext for canceling her visit and ending her relationship with the school.
Veidlinger also asked Tucker to reveal the source of his claim, but he refused to say. In her report, she wrote that he said he had “given (his) word that (he) wouldn’t divulge their name.” 
Tucker never revealed the associate’s name to the investigator, nor did he identify anyone who could support his version of events. In his Sept. 11 public statement, however, he lamented that the hearing would not afford him the opportunity to “offer any substantive evidence of innocence.”
It was not the only claim he attributed to his anonymous associate. In his interview, he said that same person told him that ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating how Tracy “goes about her business” by claiming to be a rape survivor.  
Tucker said this further caused him to believe Tracy was untrustworthy because she believed Lavigne was her friend but didn’t know she was investigating the rape story at the center of her public persona. 
It turned out to be yet another falsehood.
Reached by USA TODAY, Lavigne said in an emailed statement that she was “perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.” She said Tracy has been a source of information for her for several years, and that she has featured Tracy’s comments and advocacy work in multiple news stories.
“That has been the extent of my reporting on Tracy and her organization,” Lavigne wrote. “Neither the organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting.”
Asked who might have told Tucker this misinformation, Lavigne responded, “I have absolutely no idea who would have alleged this to anyone.”

The bullets came in plywood crates. 
Any given box was about the size of a small microwave oven. The printed label stuck to each one demonstrated a militaristic brevity. “CARTRIDGES FOR WEAPONS, INERT PROJECTILE,” next to a bright yellow hazmat sticker, “EXPLOSIVES.” 
Inside the boxes: drab green steel cans of .50-caliber ammunition. Each round was giant, more than 5 inches long, built to be fired from a gun so big it is typically bolted to a truck. The bullets were clipped together in long strands for rapid, machine-gun fire. 
By the time Bill Brown got to the boxes, they sat double-stacked eight high atop wooden pallets inside a Missouri warehouse. The pallets went on, row after row. Three million bullets in all. 
It was enough ammunition to feed a single machine gun – if fired nonstop at its rated speed eight hours a day, seven days a week – for almost six months. 
Brown’s job was to get it out of there and toward the Ukrainian front lines. The faster, the better. 
“War is bad,” Brown said. “Loss of life is bad. But at the end of the day, it’s very profitable and injects revenue into this military industrial base.”
There would be virtually no public record of this Ukrainian arms shipment. As a weapons dealer, Brown’s company would deliver the bullets under a system known as a direct commercial sale. The ammunition required a State Department signoff – but the secret deal would never appear in a White House announcement or the Congressional Record. 
Instead, it was part of a shadowy system of brokers, exporters, arms dealers and country-to-country transfers that has become one part of the race to meet demand on distant battlefields. 
Western weaponry fueled Ukraine’s summertime counteroffensive along a 600-mile front. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the effort was delayed in part by the wait for more arms. Amid concerns about that slowly progessing counteroffensive, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday with a promise of up to $175 million more in military equipment. 
Most of America’s $44 billion in documented support to Ukraine came in the form of old U.S. military stock, donated directly by the federal government. In general, commercial sales over $14 million, and sales of military-grade weaponry like mortars or missiles, require State Department approval and congressional notification.
But other aid comes via private sales. 
More than 14,000 U.S. entities are registered to conduct defense trade activities. Their deals are monitored by an alphabet soup of agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Trade secrecy clauses in federal law mean this flow of gear, weapons and ammunition is almost never revealed to the public.
Brown, who works for a small Nevada-based logistics company called Battle Born Munitions, provided USA TODAY with a rare look behind the curtain of these private sales. Details about the shipment were verified by his employer and the European government that made the purchase. State Department officials declined to answer questions about the specific shipment Brown described.
This March sale and the secret number of other shipments like it fuel Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion. Those sales also release an unknown amount of weaponry into the world. What becomes of that weaponry after it’s sold – and especially after it’s delivered – is difficult to track. 
As Brown surveyed the warehouse in Missouri, a crew steered forklifts and skid lifts among the stacks of plain wooden boxes. From high in the trusses, suspended lamp fixtures bathed the boxes in artificial daylight. Brown lifted his camera and started snapping photos. 
In just a few hours, he and his cargo would be boarding a jumbo jet. Three million bullets would climb to the stratosphere and hurtle across the north Atlantic toward a European dawn.
From Ukraine:War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented. So is the country's push for swift justice.
The bullets had once been bound for Saudi Arabia. 
Lot number SMQ19K401L026 had rolled off the assembly line in 2019 at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Kansas City. Lake City, owned by the government and run by a contractor, sprawls across nearly 4,000 acres of green Missouri farmland. Roads curve past World War II-era bunkers known as igloos, spaced out amid the countryside – far enough apart that an explosion in one won’t trigger a chain reaction in the others.
Lake City has been pumping out ammunition almost without pause since 1941. It is the largest small-arms manufacturing plant in the world.
Today the plant is run by Olin-Winchester, but in 2019, the bullets were made by some of the 1,700 workers employed by Northrop Grumman. And in 2019, Saudi Arabia was stocking up on weapons during the Trump administration, fueling the war in Yemen and other conflicts that drew criticism from congressional Democrats.
The plant manufactures .50-caliber ammunition on a rolling basis, for both military and commercial buyers. That’s a testament to just what a legend the bullet – and the gun that shoots it – has become.
In 2019, the technology was already a century old. The .50 caliber was the brainchild of American gunsmith John Browning during World War I. Built to respond to German anti-tank rifles, the M2 was first tested in 1918, and it entered widespread service in 1923. It earned the nickname “Ma Deuce” and has served in combat ever since, bolted to trucks, ships, planes and handheld stands on the battlefield.
The .50-caliber rounds – named for their diameter, about half an inch – can easily hit targets more than a mile away. At closer ranges, they will blast through solid concrete or armored vehicles. The gun can fire at a sustained rate of about 40 shots per minute.
Military setups use strings of “linked” ammunition to feed into machine guns. Spaced out after every fourth bullet, so-called tracer rounds have small pyrotechnic charges that illuminate the line of fire, aiding in targeting.
The gun’s longevity and versatility made it popular for militaries the world over. But this particular batch of bullets wouldn’t end up being sold to Saudi Arabia. 
The Biden administration put a temporary freeze on sales to the Saudi government in 2021 as it reviewed weapons deals approved under Donald Trump. Instead, Brown said, the bullets were sold to a U.S. ammunition provider, only to be held up again. Ultimately, they were mothballed. 
Then, in spring 2023, the bullets found a buyer, or actually two: first Battle Born; ultimately, the Netherlands. 
The European country, a NATO ally, needed a big supply of ammunition. It wouldn’t be keeping the bullets but giving them to Ukraine. Its purchase, essentially a donation, would count toward the country’s required NATO contribution. 
Brown had a line on exactly what they needed. It was sitting in the warehouse in Missouri. 
He arrived in March to personally oversee the shipment. As he prepped for delivery, Brown dropped tiny black tracking devices onto several of the pallets. Just $55 apiece, the units use GPS and cell signals to keep tabs on the load. The idea was to ensure it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands. 
But packing up the bullets was just the beginning. As with anything that’s deadly and made of metal, the shipping costs can be extreme. 
Brown said the question for the buyer was simple: “How fast do you want it? Forty-five to 60 days on a ship? Or in five days if I fly it?”
Brown – or Chief Bill, as he prefers – is a no-nonsense 35-year veteran of the U.S. Army and former helicopter pilot. He retired as a chief warrant officer and lives in Orlando. 
Now 59, he still spends a lot of time on the road – 10 international trips this year. He says his arms logistics work takes him to places most Americans would rather avoid – near the Syrian border or to unstable regions of Iraq.
He’ll travel halfway around the world, he quips, “have some soup, and go back to Warsaw to head home.” The trips aren’t really about the destinations. They’re about the cargo. 
On that spring day in Missouri, forklifts carefully loaded 107 pallets of the ammo onto 18 flatbed semitrailers. They’d all make the eight-hour drive to O’Hare International Airport. 
In Chicago, two Boeing 747-400s operated by National Airlines would be ready for the freight. 
Four pallets each were stacked and shrink-wrapped to create “air pallets” or “cookie sheets” weighing 12,800 pounds. Each plane could carry up to 17 of the pallets that ran the length of each plane secured by white cargo netting.
Flight records Brown provided show the two planes departed about seven hours apart, one in early afternoon, one after dark. 
The flight would take nine hours. Brown wasn’t going to the Netherlands, even though it was the buyer. The planes were bound for Rzeszów, Poland. 
The ancient city sits at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland. It has a gleaming modern airport next to a major east-west freeway. From there, it’s barely 60 miles to the border with Ukraine. 
It was an expensive journey. The trucking company’s bill for those 18 semis? $85,000. Chartering the two 747s? $625,000. Each.
But this shipment of .50-cal rounds was profitable for Battle Born Munitions, according to Brown.
The company purchased the 3 million rounds from Northrop Grumman at a bargain and resold them for more than double the price. (In subsequent interviews, representatives at BBM disputed the specific totals Brown mentioned, saying the accurate figures were protected by “various commercial and government non-disclosure agreements.” They did not dispute the other specifics of the deal he provided.) 
Retail prices for .50-caliber ammunition run roughly $5 per bullet. At that rate, the whole shipment would have been worth $15 million.
The pricing might also be elastic. The Dutch mark up the price of the bullets and count it toward their NATO contribution, pegged to a percentage of gross domestic product, Brown said. The Netherlands has contributed about $15 billion to NATO this year, or about 1.7% of its GDP and just under the NATO mandate of 2%.
Representatives of the Dutch military confirmed the shipment to USA TODAY but declined to comment further about the pricing or details.
The war in Ukraine has only increased the demand for private deals. The State Department signed off on more than $154 billion in commercial arms deals directly to foreign countries in 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year. 
Direct commercial sales represent a modest portion of the contribution to Ukraine compared with the $44 billion donated by the U.S., but they still amounted to more than $600 million in sales from U.S. companies to the Ukrainian government last year alone. That doesn’t include sales to other countries that also support Ukraine – sales like the one Brown described.
Jim Bartlett, an attorney with expertise in the specialized international arms transactions, said private U.S. businesses are playing a small but important role in the conflict.
“American companies are happy to export defense articles to foreign buyers approved by the U.S. State Department,” Bartlett said. “There’s an effort at the State Department to quickly clear the ones headed for Ukraine. … You get head-of-the-line privileges.”
Those sales also come with risks. 
Direct sales face fewer regulatory controls, oversight and enforcement, said Robert Nichols, an international military sales expert and attorney at the law firm Nichols Liu.
“You can imagine the range of characters involved in supplying a war effort,” Nichols said. “Some are highly credible. Others will skirt the law and sometimes step over the line by paying bribes, committing fraud and hiding their transactions.” 
So far, the Department of Justice has indicted just a handful of arms brokers over deals related to the war in Ukraine. Court records show the government has charged Miami-based Oleg Patsulya and Vasilii Besedin with illegally attempting to sell American-made aircraft parts to Russia. They allegedly lied to Commerce Department agents and told them the parts were bound for Turkey. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges this summer. 
A State Department spokesman declined to provide details of enforcement actions but said, “The United States takes seriously our responsibility to protect American military and dual-use technologies and prevent their diversion, including through strong enforcement actions.”
NATO said it oversees allied arms deliveries, and that those arms generally reach Ukraine. NATO itself technically only provides non-non-lethal aid, like fuel, medical supplies and generators.
Brown, of Battle Born, says he fields calls weekly from “clowns” without the proper licensing, whom he reports to the State Department for potential violations. Some raise red flags when they approach him about transactions that include payment via diamonds or gold.
He prefers traditional wire transfers with approved sales partners since he knows government officials are watching. He validates the contracts and checks certificates for the final users. That’s part of why he traveled with the ammunition. He would be meeting a Dutch military official for the official handoff.
“My job is to keep us all out of jail,” Brown said. 
The two 747s touched down in Poland, one before the sun, the other in late morning. Brown exchanged paperwork with a young Dutch military staffer who signed for the delivery, he said. They traded military patches as souvenirs. They snapped a photo together. 
The bullets bought by the Netherlands would never touch Dutch soil. 
U.S. aid:Billions from the US flows to Ukraine. Here's where it comes from, and how it adds up
Despite playing a small role proportionately in the war, $600 million in direct commercial sales can buy a lot of small weaponry. 
And those weapons are the kind most apt to fall into illicit use, said Elias Yousif, a research analyst at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit think tank.
Put another way: It’s hard to sneak away an F-16 or a missile launcher the size of a tractor-trailer. But a bunch of guns or a pallet of ammo? Much easier to resell. 
“In the commercial sector, especially in a new market, the risk increases,” Yousif said.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss arms research project, estimated that within a year, battlefield seizures and other forms of diversion led to 300,000 small arms and light weapons going missing, including 100,000 in Crimea alone.
When small arms go missing, they can go missing into another country, maybe one led by a despot or even a terrorist organization.
The U.S. government says diversion of American donations has been widely absent so far in Ukraine. That could be a combination of intensive “end-use-monitoring” programs and the reality of the battlefield, where supplies are rapidly put to use.
But even if not now, unused ammo could be resold someday. 
“History shows us this isn’t a short-term issue,” Yousif said.  “These are commodities with very long shelf lives.” 
Florida-based Global Ordnance, another State Department-licensed exporter, is a competitor in the direct weapons sales business. General counsel Bryan Van Brunt said the company has extensive protocols in place to track shipments and make sure the end-users are federally approved, though he declined to provide specifics about those systems. 
Brown, with Battle Born Munitions, says the company employs a mix of simple and sophisticated tracking technology to ensure his shipments are tracked to end users. The black GPS devices he dropped onto his cargo tracked the ammo all the way across the globe.
But that system only works as long as Brown is actually tracking. “Technically, my role ends when I deliver it to NATO,” he said.
Sometime after the 747s touched down in Poland, along with signing the paperwork and snapping a selfie with the Dutch official, Brown found the tiny black GPS trackers and lifted them off the pallets. 
Ukrainian trucks would arrive at the airport to pick up the ammunition. They would point toward the border, and onward to Lviv, and some distant battlefield. 
Brown would point in the opposite direction. Just like one of his quips: Fly in, have soup, get home. He headed toward Warsaw, with the GPS trackers in his bag.

The geography professor didn’t hide his clown fetish or the fact that he sometimes indulged his urges by recruiting students as subjects. He posted regularly about it on social media.
“I have a facepaint fetish and convince the cute girls in my classes to let me paint their faces,” he once wrote.
Yet Joseph Tokosh held jobs at two colleges and was on the tenure track at a third before student journalists at Nicholls State University in Louisiana exposed his behavior. He submitted his resignation the same day their story was published.
His interactions with students and open discussion of his fetish happened in both mainstream and tailored digital spaces. He popped into Facebook groups geared toward new students and niche forums on websites like Reddit. He posted videos on YouTube. In one Reddit post on a forum meant to highlight hard-to-believe stories, Tokosh posted pictures of several women in white face paint.
Over the years, two students reported him to campus police; others complained online. He left Kent State University after pleading no contest to something different: a theft charge that involved entering his peers’ offices without permission and taking a USB drive. Tokosh has not been charged with any other crime.
Tokosh’s career trajectory exposes inadequacies in the background check system that colleges and universities are supposed to have in place to protect students – especially when evidence of the concerning behavior resides largely on the internet. Nicholls State, for example, told USA TODAY Network reporters it does not routinely check social media for new hires.
A federal law intended to ensure the academic privacy of students also makes it difficult to determine how Tokosh was able to move so freely from campus to campus. Both Kent State and Northern Illinois University – where he taught while finishing his doctorate – noted Tokosh’s protected status as a graduate student in declining to answer questions.
Sophie Levan was a freshman at Kent State in 2017 when she encountered Tokosh, then 28, in a Facebook group intended as a gathering place for new students. Tokosh had offered cash to anyone willing to let him paint their faces. Levan, then 18, agreed.
The money was appealing but the interactions soured. 
Tokosh, she said, insisted he come pick her up and take her to the building that housed the geography department, where he would paint her face. Uneasy, Levan stopped responding. Tokosh got angry and wouldn’t give up, she said, which led her to file a police report.
“I felt like the school would want to know about it,” Levan said. “I thought maybe they could prevent anything bad from happening since other girls would go with him.”
She said there was never any followup from campus police – or anyone else.
USA TODAY Network reporters reviewed the experiences of six students who were the subject of Tokosh’s attention going back to his time at Kent State.
In addition to Levan, the other person who reported Tokosh to campus police could not be reached for comment. The two who expressed public concerns on social media told USA TODAY they never heard from their campus officials either.
USA TODAY attempted to reach Tokosh via phone, social media and a certified letter. A person answered a phone call to a number associated with Tokosh, but he hung up after the reporter identified himself. A reporter also reached someone who identified herself as Tokosh’s mother. She said she would pass along that reporters were trying to reach him.
Tokosh told the Nicholls student journalists that he did have an assignment where students were required to paint their faces as part of a cultural exercise. Prior to the article in the student newspaper The Nicholls Worth, the university had already cut Tokosh loose. He said his contract was not renewed because he was the target of a “grade inflation task force.”
The university, however, “does not have any such task force,” according to Nicholls spokesman Jerad David.
Tokosh also told students the face painting was a requirement in his cultural geography class to better understand other cultures. In a video interview with Hannah Robert, the station manager for the student-run KNSU TV, he says: “That's an assignment in one of my classes where they actually come up with their own face paint and makeup design inspired by a culture and they implement it.”
It’s a well-established trend in the academic world for professors to bounce from one institution to another without having to disclose why they left their last post, said Julie Libarkin, an associate dean at Michigan State University. She has seen the pattern often in her work maintaining a database of publicly documented sexual misconduct by faculty and staff.
As for grad students? Libarkin said people have requested she add them to her list, but universities’ conservative interpretations of the law get in the way.
“I don’t on purpose,” she said, “because that’s information that almost never comes out.”
Tokosh arrived at Kent State in 2015 with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in geography from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, according to his curriculum vitae. He was working toward his doctorate and researched fading businesses. His work about shopping malls in the Rust Belt won several awards. Like many graduate students, he also taught classes.
Then, Tokosh started showing up in the Facebook groups for new students. In a December 2017 post, an account under the name “Joe Tokosh” posted several pictures of women made up to look like clowns or skulls.
“If anyone is looking for some extra cash, I am looking for people to practice facepainting on!” he wrote. “I will literally pay you!”
Those are the types of posts that caught Levan’s eye. Not only was she pressed for cash, she was interested in movie makeup and thought the face painting could be fun based on the photos Tokosh had posted. But Levan said she soon realized that those images were stock photos and not representative of what Tokosh could do.
What’s more, she figured out that he was a graduate student, a fact she said he didn’t disclose in his posts.
When Tokosh offered to pick her up from her dorm, she refused. But, she said, Tokosh kept insisting she agreed to participate. Levan stopped responding to his messages and filed a police report with the Kent State police in January 2018. They advised her only to stop talking to Tokosh, she said, and let them know if “anything of consequence occurred.”
Months after she refused to meet up and filed the police report, Tokosh texted a picture of himself wearing white face paint to her cellphone. It arrived at midnight and contained no message, although writing on his shirt read: “I'm not a failure.”  
“There was some negative intention with sending that photo,” Levan said. “It’s definitely burned into my mind.”
What Levan didn’t know is that campus police had been put on notice a year earlier when another student filed a similar report. That student told police Tokosh reached out to her and her friends after they posted their numbers on a Facebook group for undergraduates. He would send “get to know you” messages, the police report said, and then ask the student if she was “interested in having her face painted for one of his class projects.”
When she found out Tokosh was a graduate student, she said no and eventually blocked him on Facebook and Snapchat, according to the report. Tokosh continued to text her.
“She does not have any concerns for her safety, but just wanted this documented,” the police report read. 
In July 2017, another student had retweeted a message from Kent State’s Twitter account that asked for Kent State love stories. She wrote: “A geography professor requested me on facebook and asked if he could paint my face like a clown.”
The student confirmed to USA TODAY that the professor was Tokosh and shared a screenshot of a Facebook friend request he sent her. She said she suspected Tokosh also found her on a freshman Facebook group because she posted there often.
She said she tweeted to draw officials’ attention to it and moved on but now wishes she had reported it officially.
College campuses are supposed to offer students special protections from sexual harassment even when it falls short of criminal behavior. Title IX, often associated with equity in women’s sports, also addresses “sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence” at schools that receive federal funding.
Colleges infrequently and unevenly enforce the rule, however. A 2022 USA TODAY investigation found just one of every 12,400 students was suspended in connection with sexual misconduct.
The student who shared her story online said the only response she received was from a graduate student in the geography department, who contacted her on Oct. 1, 2018. In an email, he wrote that he had seen her post and suspected he knew which faculty member had asked her about face painting.
“I brought it to the attention of some of our faculty because I was pretty sure I knew who it was, but they were certain it wasn’t that individual and that you probably just meant geology,” he wrote. 
He went on to reference another student being “approached in (at least by just looking at your tweet) a much more aggressive way.” The grad student asked the undergraduate for more information, but, she told USA TODAY, she didn’t respond. She said she started drafting a reply, but a year had passed. She wanted to move on.
Kent State would not say whether any actions were taken after the students’ reports, but Eric Mansfield, a spokesman for the university, said the police department confirmed that the students who filed police reports were provided with “university resources, which would include other non-criminal avenues to pursue (Counseling Services, Title IX, Center for Sexual and Relationship Violence Services, etc.) as a general police practice.”
Levan does not recall police offering her services, but she said she didn’t want counseling. She wanted Tokosh investigated.
Mansfield also said that the university monitors social media but that colleges “can’t always see or track every mention on social media.”
Police records show that officers did investigate when Tokosh was accused of breaking into geography department offices. A blotter item in the local newspaper shows police obtained an arrest warrant in connection with a third-degree felony burglary charge. Court documents indicate Tokosh pleaded no contest to a theft on Oct. 19, 2018.
Kent State would not explain what led to Tokosh’s departure during that fall semester. Instead, the university said that since Tokosh was a graduate student, any information about him was protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It also would not say whether school officials shared Tokosh’s disciplinary record with other colleges or even if it was standard practice to do so for grad students.
“Due to FERPA, student education records are private,” said Emily Vincent, a university spokeswoman. “Also, we do not comment on personnel matters.”
When Congress passed FERPA in 1974, its author, Sen. James L. Buckley of New York, said the intent was to protect the academic privacy of students and their families. In more recent years, Buckley has become critical of the law and how schools interpret it. He told the Columbus Dispatch in 2010 that “the law needs to be revamped.”
Survivors of sexual violence and students accuse universities of using the law to avoid negative media coverage. Students with a history of bad behavior may jump from one school to another without the public ever knowing about their histories. Law enforcement records don’t fall under FERPA’s purview, but a wide variety of questionable behavior does.
One case involved Brandon Austin, who was accused of sexual assault at Providence College in 2013 while on the school’s basketball team. But Providence College initially said Austin was suspended for violating the school’s code of student conduct and declined to share further details with the Providence Journal, citing federal privacy laws. Austin denied wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime. 
Austin was able to transfer to the University of Oregon, where he was again accused of sexual assault, along with other players. Police investigated the claims, and the local district attorney declined to press charges. The university expelled him anyway but raised FERPA when it declined to release records showing what Oregon knew about the allegations, according to the Oregonian.
LeRoy Rooker was the director of the U.S. Education Department office that oversaw FERPA for more than two decades. Rooker, now a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said FERPA is not a confidentiality law – it is focused on education records. And it doesn’t apply when a student is “seeking or intending to enroll” at another college.
Therefore, Rooker said, Kent State could have shared information about Tokosh with Northern Illinois.
Rooker also said FERPA would not have prevented Kent State from telling reporters if other universities had inquired about Tokosh, though they could not have disclosed what they shared.
He blamed the overuse of the law on fear of being sued.
“In this litigious age, institutions get a little wonky about whether they will forward, say, disciplinary records,” Rooker said. “On the other hand, if you have something and you don’t share it when you can and something happens at the next institution, I would say that’s a big liability.”
Backgrounding job applicants has become increasingly complex.
While most U.S. employers conduct background screening, according to trade group data, those inquiries typically focus on criminal history. Social media receives far less attention even though that is where people are most likely to share their unguarded thoughts.
Undertaking a full review of a person’s social media presence is more difficult than just checking an applicant’s Facebook page.
Does an applicant have an account on X, formerly Twitter? How about an account with Discord, an online platform frequented by gamers, where leaked Pentagon documents were recently shared? Or what about a Telegram account, a messaging platform popular among white nationalists? Further complicating things, it’s common on sites like Reddit for users to adopt usernames and describe experiences with little to no ties to reality.
A little digging, however, can turn up a lot of dirt.  
Tokosh has a LinkedIn page that includes his teaching stints at Northern Illinois University and Nicholls State University. His time as a student and instructor at Kent State is absent.
For LinkedIn, a custom URL includes a play on his name and his chosen field of study: Joeography. Tokosh would later use that moniker in promotional materials for a class at Nicholls State. That is the same handle used on Reddit by someone with a special interest in face paint.
One post features a video of Tokosh throwing a pie at someone. Other posts mention a “clown fetish.” In a forum titled “Creepy,” he wrote, “I convince pretty girls to let me paint their faces,” along with a photo with multiple women in white face paint.
That and other similar posts remained live for years until they were taken down after the Nicholls students published their story in late March.
USA TODAY Network reporters captured screenshots before they disappeared. With dates in 2019, the posts feature a young woman wearing a Kent State T-shirt. The material would have been available to administrators at Northern Illinois before the start of the fall 2019 semester.
Joe King, a spokesman for Northern Illinois, said departments hiring new graduate students are “not required to check social media or investigate a disciplinary history.” He added some departments may reach out to the graduate students’ former advisers.
King said he could not determine if the university was aware of Tokosh’s behavior at Kent State. He said that due to FERPA, he could not share specifics about Tokosh’s time at Northern Illinois, including whether students had complained about him.
But there are signs the behavior continued.
A YouTube account under the name “Joe Tokosh” included at least two videos in 2020 of a man throwing pies at women. One of the videos features a young woman also seen in the screenshots from Tokosh’s Reddit account. 
Comments on one from October 2020 read: “You can have a video of her tied up getting pied via cash app.” That video was viewed more than 30,000 times before it was turned off in late July, around the time a USA TODAY reporter reached out to Tokosh.
A former Northern Illinois State student shared text messages exchanged with Tokosh in which he asked to paint her face on multiple occasions. USA TODAY has agreed not to name her because she is concerned Tokosh might retaliate against her.
In the text messages, Tokosh shared a photo of a young woman in white face paint – an image also posted to the Joeography Reddit account. She said she declined to do it but was aware that other Northern Illinois students had participated.
By fall 2022, when he had moved on to Nicholls, Tokosh revealed to the student that he had required students in his cultural geography class to paint their faces.  
The Northern Illinois student asked Tokosh what he did with the photos, and she said he suggested that he might spin them off into a research project someday. She asked, had anyone complained? She said Tokosh responded: Why would they?
Many students would find a reason to complain, as Nicholls State student journalist Sally-Anne Torres learned firsthand. It started in January when one of her fellow reporters picked up an odd rumor: a professor was offering extra credit for students willing to paint their faces like clowns. Initially, Torres dismissed it because it seemed too unusual and there weren’t a lot of leads to follow. 
By Feb. 7, university administrators informed Tokosh that his contract would not be renewed, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY via a records request. They gave no reason for the nonrenewal, but on Feb. 12, Tokosh emailed his students that the university was letting him go. He blamed his departure on giving too many A’s.
That seemed suspicious to Torres. 
During her reporting, she received a tip about Tokosh’s Reddit posts in which he wrote of his “clown fetish” and how he enlisted his students to participate in it.
“It wasn’t just this innocent thing that a lot of these girls thought it was,” Torres said. “As a professor or teacher, that is somebody students are supposed to trust. He used his power to ruin that trust and to do these things, and that made me angry for them.”
Torres spoke to six students who shared their experiences with Tokosh. Some, she said, were followed on Twitter by him while others opted into an extra credit assignment he offered.
The women told Torres he sometimes giggled and laughed as they painted their faces in his office.
On March 27, the Nicholls Worth published a story headlined, “Geography professor suspended immediately, students allege sexual harassment.” KNSU TV, a student broadcast network, also aired footage in which Tokosh defended the assignment on camera. That same day, Tokosh submitted his resignation.
The story’s publication prompted other students to come forward about Tokosh and their frustration with the university.
Bradley Price took an online class with Tokosh and said the professor required students to photograph themselves with their faces painted. Price said Tokosh told them the assignment was to help them understand Japanese culture, but then Tokosh offered him bonus points if he could get a female friend to paint her face.
It seemed unusual at the time, Price said, because his friend wasn’t in the class. It became more concerning to him on reading the student newspaper’s report.
“I feel frankly disgusted and disappointed that Nicholls couldn’t do a proper background check on this professor, because this is unacceptable,” Price said. 
Bella Ramos, a junior at Nicholls State who did not take any of Tokosh’s classes, told USA TODAY that someone using the handle @Joeography21 followed her on Twitter in late 2021 and started liking all her selfies.
Ramos learned that the person behind the account was likely a professor at the university. She posted about the behavior in January 2022, but nothing came of it. She also found the Joeography Reddit account. On March 27, the same day the student newspaper published its piece, Ramos posted screenshots of her discoveries on Twitter with the message, “Found a Nicholls state university professor on Reddit.”
“I wish the university had acted sooner because all this information was public on the internet,” she told USA TODAY. 
No one from the university, she said, has ever reached out.

An array of false and misleading claims have spread widely on social media in the midst of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Israel formally declared war after the Palestinian militant group launched a surprise attack on the morning of Oct. 7. The Israeli military has fought to regain control of several towns on the border with Gaza and responded with retaliatory strikes in the blockaded enclave. More than 1,900 people have died in the ongoing conflict as of Oct. 11.
The ensuing wave of misinformation echoes the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Again, major social media platforms are awash in claims that old photos and videos actually showed the present conflict, while other posts fabricate or exaggerate the nature of the conflict and the American response.
Here's a roundup of claims about the Israel-Hamas conflict from the USA TODAY Fact-Check Team:

WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday announced a $200 million military aid package for Ukraine that includes ammunition for air defense and artillery ammuniton and anti-tank and -drone weapons.
Austin’s announcement, after a meeting of allies in Brussels, comes a week after a Russian missile attack killed more than 50 people at a café and market in eastern Ukraine. The new weapons shipment is the latest since the Russian invasion in Feb. 2022, bringing total American military support to more than $40 billion.
The lack of House speaker has cast doubt on congressional approval for future aid to Ukraine. Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there is enough funding to supply Ukraine through the end of the year.
The lack of a breakthrough by Ukrainian forces in their months-long offensive has also caused unease among allies and softening support in the United States. But Austin noted that several nations, including Germany, Great Britain, Spain and Sweden, made commitments valued at hundreds of dollars to Ukraine.
F-16 warplanes, long sought by Ukraine, will be ready for combat in the spring at the earliest, Austin said.
Concerning Israel, Brown said there was no indication that adversaries such as Hezbollah had sought to attack Israel following the assault by Hamas militants on Saturday. The Pentagon moved the USS Gerald Ford Strike Group, an aircraft carrier, destroyers and 5,000 sailors to the eastern Mediterranean to deter such attacks.
Attorneys for MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell want to quit his defamation case due to not receiving any payment from Lindell or MyPillow.
Attorneys representing Lindell are asking the courts for permission to quit his case according to court documents. Lindell faces a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit by voting machine companies Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems. Attorney Andrew Parker claims that Lindell owes them millions of dollars he cannot pay back.
Lindell spoke to the Associated Press and confirmed that he does not have enough money to pay the lawyers and understands why they are dropping the case.
Parker wrote to the court that he and his firm cannot afford to represent MyPillow through the rest of the litigation. Parker claims that this would put the firm at a substantial financial risk.
Parker wrote in his fillings that Lindell paid the firm through the end of 2022. However, according to Parker, the payments slowed down in 2023 when fees for litigation increased. In May, the firm received payments over 60 days late and the payment did not meet the total of bills due. In July and August, no payments were made at all.
Lindell and MyPillow were warned by Parker and his firm, Parker Daniels Kibort, that they would have to quit their case if payment was not made.
MyPillow financial troubles:auctioning off hundreds of items after retailers drop product, Mike Lindell says
Lindell has seen much financial trouble this year. Along with the lawsuit against him, many retailers like Walmart discontinued his products after he backed former President Donald Trump's claims about the 2020 election.
In April, Lindell was ordered to pay $5 million to a software engineer for breaching a contract with the engineer. Lindell used data to support his claims that China helped in the 2020 elections and helped President Joe Biden win. This was all part of his "Prove Mike Wrong Challenge" at the "Cyber Symposium" in 2021 located in South Dakota.
Although Mike Lindell plans not to file for bankruptcy, he admits that MyPillow has suffered dramatically.

The company was impacted by Lindell's backing of former President Donald Trump's election fraud claims, for which he is currently fighting off a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit.
Lindell has previously said that MyPillow lost $100 million after his election fraud claims, WCCO reported. His company also lost an arbitration case in April related to election fraud claims, leading to his company, Lindell LLC, being ordered to pay $5 million.
WASHINGTON — House Republicans made a major step toward electing a new speaker on Wednesday, formally nominating as a conference House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.
In an internal secret ballot vote, Scalise beat out his primary rival, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, by a vote of 113-99, according to Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.
"We have a lot of work to do," Scalise said exiting the closed-door meeting where the vote was held. "Not just in the House for the people of this country but we see how dangerous of a world it is and how things can change so quickly."
The conference vote however, is just a sign of approval from House Republicans at large. The House still has to formally elect a new speaker on the House floor, and lawmakers are still free to nominate other candidates. 
Exiting the vote, multiple GOP lawmakers including Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, told reporters they still planned to vote for Jordan on the House floor in a display of the uphill battle Scalise is facing to become speaker.
House Republicans control the lower chamber by a razor-thin majority. Scalise needs 217 votes to be elected speaker and can only afford to lose four votes considering there are 221 House Republicans.
Opposition to Scalise slowly racked up on social media as other Jordan's supporters said they would still vote for the Ohio Republican on the floor.
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said on X, formerly Twitter, said she voted to nominate Jordan in conference and still plans to vote for him on the House floor, citing health concerns with Scalise as he is currently battling blood cancer.
Scalise’s nomination, however, is still a major boost for the Louisiana Republican, who is currently the No. 2 ranking House Republican.
House Republicans could move to hold a speaker election on the floor as early as Wednesday afternoon.
House Democrats are expected to stay out of the process and rally behind House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for the speakership in a show of unity. The onus, they say, is on House Republicans to elect a new speaker. 
Allison Josephs got a bone-chilling threat in 2012 from someone who identified herself as Becky. “Hitler should have finished his good work,” the message read. The writer said she had her Louisville Slugger ready for the “next chance we get.”
The frequency of hate-filled social media posts targeting Jews has only increased since then, said Josephs, a mother of four who runs the nonprofit Jew in the City. 
So she said she was not surprised by the wave of online hate immediately following the deadly attacks in Israel as people celebrated Hamas’ acts of terror, striking fear of more violence to come.
“From a social media perspective, it’s already been so bad, it’s kind of hard for it to get worse,” Josephs said.
But it is getting worse. Groups who study online hate speech say it has spiked in recent days – not just for Jewish communities but also for Palestinians, who have faced increasing online hatred. And representatives of both communities agree on one thing: U.S.-based social media companies are still not doing anywhere near enough to rid their platforms of hate against targeted groups.
“When it comes to serious crises like these where you're going to see the worst of the worst types of violent content, gore, incitement to violence, it's really incumbent on social media companies to coordinate across platforms,” said Daniel Kelley, director of strategy and operations at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center for Tech and Society, “in order to make sure that the platforms play the minimal amount of role possible in inflaming further violence.”
The escalation in harsh rhetoric comes at a time when online hate speech was already increasing, experts said. In the weeks before the conflict, the ADL was locked in a bitter dispute with X, formerly Twitter, over Elon Musk’s alleged promotion of extremists and hands-off approach to content moderation. Meanwhile, 7amleh, an Arab civil rights organization has been meeting with X for months, trying to persuade the company to quell hate speech against Palestinians.
And it’s not just X. Representatives of civil rights groups said they face a constant struggle working with powerful social media platforms to combat hate speech at the best of times. As the conflict in the Middle East escalates, they said, these companies really need to step up their game.

“Social media platforms are putting the burden of monitoring hate speech, incitement and violent speech on civil society organizations with limited resources and this is not OK,” said Mona Shtaya, a nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. “We are talking about tech giants that are making billions of dollars annually, who cannot invest more money and resources in their platforms to protect oppressed communities, especially in times of crisis.”
Several organizations monitoring online hate speech agree there has been a significant increase in such posts in the four days since Hamas attacked Israel. 
Matthew Williams, founder and chief scientist of the online harms monitoring platform nisien.ai, said the online harms monitoring platform has been identifying trends across social media since the conflict broke out. 
"The Hamas terror attack and the subsequent declaration of war by Israel coincided with significant spikes in both forms of hate speech, indicating their roles as 'trigger events,'" Williams said. “Nisien.ai has identified an increase in both antisemitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric, as might have been anticipated.” 
Debunked conspiracy theories, racist posts against Jewish people and Palestinians and hate-filled calls for violence flooded X and other social media platforms over the weekend, according to the groups monitoring them.The ADL noted several examples of such posts in a report released this weekend.
On X, a popular antisemitic influencer posted photographs of the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11 referencing the completely disproven conspiracy theory that the attack was connected to Israel: “It’s hard to have much sympathy for the Israeli regime when they helped perpetrate this attack on my country.” The post had more than 3,800 likes as of Tuesday afternoon.
The ADL counted 347 messages on Telegram from extremists calling for violence against Jews, Israelis and Zionists in the first 18 hours of Saturday, up approximately 488% from the day before. 
7amleh, The Arab Center for Social Media Advancement, a nonprofit that partners with Meta, Facebook’s parent company, has also been monitoring hate speech against Palestinians. The organization’s researchers manually found 260 examples of hate speech across all platforms in the last few days. 7amleh’s automated analysis identified 4,305 posts on X related to the invasion and ensuing conflict that contained violent or hateful speech.
Noting the “surge of antisemitism, hate, disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda spread on social media and messaging platforms,” the ADL released a guide for social media platforms over the weekend. It details seven steps the organization wants social media companies to take immediately, including increasing human and automated trust and safety resources and promoting trusted and reliable news sources.
The ADL’s report also noted that domestic extremists, white supremacists and conspiracy theorists have flocked online to cheer on the attack on Israel. Much of that hate unfolded on Telegram, the go-to messaging and social media platform for extremists. But hateful posts have also been shared on X and on Gab, another fringe platform popular with far-right extremists. 
Social media companies say they are closely monitoring the situation. 
Meta said it has Hebrew and Arabic speakers working around the clock to respond in real time. TikTok said it has also ramped up resources to help curb violent, hateful, or misleading content and boosted moderation resources in Hebrew and Arabic.
YouTube owner Google said during major world events like the Hamas attacks on Israel, it prioritizes news and information from authoritative sources and removes harmful content. Content produced by terrorist organizations including footage showing hostages is not permitted on YouTube and that includes content produced by Hamas, according to YouTube. 
“Hate speech targeting the Jewish, Palestinian or any other religious or ethnic communities is not allowed on YouTube,” the company said in a statement. “This applies to all forms of content, including videos, livestreams and comments, and our policies are enforced across languages and locales.”
Adding to the challenge in monitoring antisemitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric is that “some of this hate is coded, with some posters avoiding recognized racial and religious slurs, and instead constructing their posts using negative stereotypes and tropes,” Williams said.
That makes it more difficult for automatic moderation and human moderators to catch inappropriate posts. As hateful language evolves, and new terms and slogans become popular, moderators must constantly evolve their efforts.
But social media companies like Meta, looking to reduce costs, have eliminated jobs focused on safety issues. They are increasingly leaning on artificial intelligence systems to moderate content and enforce their rules. 
“For the moment we're seeing a lack of investment – we're seeing a lack of ability to independently verify the rate and the amount and the severity of hate,” the ADL’s Kelley said.
X has been widely criticized for its hands-off approach to posts trading in hate speech, misinformation and violence, according to experts monitoring social media.
Posts depicting graphic pictures of murdered civilians and Israeli soldiers, antisemitic hate speech and anti-Palestinian messages are being widely shared on Elon Musk’s platform, those experts said.
X, which gutted its content moderation team under Musk, said late Monday that it was taking the situation seriously as more than 50 million posts about the Hamas attack flooded the platform.
“As the events continue to unfold rapidly, a cross-company leadership group has assessed this moment as a crisis requiring the highest level of response,” the company’s safety account tweeted.
X said its escalations team was “continuing to proactively monitor for antisemitic speech,” removed newly created Hamas-affiliated accounts and took action against “tens of thousands of posts for sharing graphic media, violent speech, and hateful conduct.” It urged people who were concerned about the flood of graphic and misleading content to choose not to see “sensitive media.” X did not respond to a request for comment.
European officials warned X on Tuesday that the company appears to be hosting misinformation about the war in violation of the European Union's content moderation law, CNN reported.
Nadim Nashif, founder and director of 7amleh, said his group has been trying for months to get X to take anti-Palestinian hate speech on the platform seriously. 
Nashif said the company doesn’t do anything to moderate hateful posts written in Hebrew.
The last time 7amleh met with Twitter, they offered the company a lexicon of commonly used hate speech terms in Hebrew, Nashif said. The X representative asked 7amleh to translate it into English, he said.
X is “horrible at content moderation,” he said. “Specifically, in Hebrew, they have nothing. Basically, you can write, ‘kill them,’ ‘rape them,’ ‘burn them’ – whatever you want. It's like an open stage for extremism.”
X’s response to the flood of hate speech has been to promote “community notes,” an outsourced effort that relies on verified volunteers to attach notes to posts that are inaccurate.
Musk praised the open-source effort to moderate harmful content in a post on Tuesday, writing “Thank you for fighting for truth.”
The concept that we are all computer-generated characters occupying a world as real as the ones gamers explore on their PlayStation consoles isn't exactly a new one.
As far back as 1999, Morpheus was entering "The Matrix" to break Neo and a few other chosen few out of a simulated reality created by advanced machines in order to use humans as an energy source. But as the idea permeates not just the realm of science fiction and popular culture, but academia as well, every now and then a philosopher or physicist has something new to say about it.
That's what happened this week when a physicist at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom proposed that a new law of physics could support the theory that what we see as our reality is in fact a complex virtual simulation running on a cosmic computer. The theory stems from previous research that Dr. Melvin Vopson has conducted looking into whether information has mass.
"Any normal person will think, could it be that maybe we already are in some kind of digital virtual reality world?" Vopson said in a March video posted on the university's YouTube channel.
"It's not farfetched to assume that an advanced civilization or maybe ourselves in the future, we reach the technological level where we can simulate our world or the whole universe and it's indistinguishable from the reality."
Psyche mission, explained:What to know about NASA's long-awaited trip to a strange metal asteroid
The idea that the cosmos runs on quantum codes has existed for years, becoming popularized in academia in 2003 when philosopher Nick Bostrom of the University of Oxford wrote an influential paper about the simulation argument.
In principle, anything can be simulated with a computer with sufficient power. Bostrom argued that for advanced civilizations, such an intricate simulation would be rather easy for those wanting to explore their histories or entertain their children.
The theory is popular among many notable figures, including Elon Musk. The Tesla founder and CEO weighed in at a 2016 conference, stating that in his opinion, the odds that we're living in what he called "base reality" — in other words, the real universe as opposed to a simulated one — are “one in billions.”
So are we not unlike the characters we oversee in the Sims, confined to a superficial, restricted sandbox while more advanced beings are spectators to our existence?
It's hard to say, as the theory is as hard to disprove as it it to prove. In fact, 2020 research authored by David Kipping, an astronomer at Columbia University, found that the odds of us living in a base reality are pretty much 50-50, with the odds only slightly in favor of our universe not being simulated.

Prada in space:Famed Italian fashion house will help design NASA's spacesuits for mission to the moon
Vopson's latest research stems from the abstract concept that information is the fundamental building block of the universe and has both energy and physical mass.
"My questions was, where is that information going when the bit is at equilibrium and is stored information?" he said in the Youtube video. "Energy can't exist on its own, it needs to be in some form."
It's the belief of Vopson and others working in the field of science known as information physics that our physical reality could be made up of bits of information, which aren't unlike the cells of living organisms that are coded with DNA containing valuable information about themselves.
After studying digital data storage and an RNA genome, Vopson discovered in 2022 that information systems don't appear to conform to the second law of thermodynamics. That law essentially dictates that any naturally occurring process will result in a loss of energy and increase in a system's measure of disorder, or entropy (think of an ice cube that gradually melts when placed in a cup of water at room temperature.)
In fact, Vopson discovered that the entropy in information systems actually decreases, leading him to establish what he calls the second law of information dynamics.
Vopson recently set out to apply the discovery to genetics, cosmology, atomic physics, symmetry and yes, even the simulation hypothesis. Published last week in AIP Advances, Vopson's paper provides an explanation for how the removal of excess information in our universe resembles the process of a computer deleting or compressing unneeded code to save storage space and conserve power.
In short, it's a process he said could support the idea that we may be living in a Matrix-style artificial reality akin to a computer simulation, where we and anything else we perceive is nothing more than a virtual facsimile.
"It doesn't prove entirely that," Vopson said in the video. "It underpins the concept through empirical evidence, but it doesn't mean necessarily that is totally the consensus that is happening; it is one possibility."

If those animatronics at amusement parks or Arnold Schwarzinger's character in "The Terminator" set you on edge, you might want to keep away from Agility Robotics' newest factory.
The creators of Digit, a human-sized bipedal robot complete with "eyes," are bringing the world's first humanoid robot factory to Oregon, creatively named RoboFab.
Agility Robotics announced the opening in Salem, Oregon on Monday, saying they expect to soon have the capacity to produce 10,00 robots annually. Construction of the 70,000-square-foot facility began last year and is set to open in late 2023.
Creating advanced robots for sale to the public is a new development in the robotics industry, as access to such high-end tech has been generally reserved for entities such as businesses and government agencies in the past.
Now, however, Damion Shelton, Agility Robotics’ co-founder and CEO, said the opening of the facility marks a pivotal moment in the history of robots: the beginning of mass production of commercial humanoid bots.
“We built Digit to solve difficult problems in today’s workforce like injuries, burnout, high turnover and unfillable labor gaps, with the ultimate vision of enabling humans to be more human," Shelton told the Salem Statesman Journal, part of the USA TODAY network. "When you’re building new technology to make society better, the most important milestone is when you’re able to mass produce that technology at a scale where it can have a real, widespread impact.”

The first iteration of Digit was initially released in 2020 and featured a bipedal, human-sized design, though it was eerily headless. This Digit was capable of preforming some tasks autonomously, such as picking up a box, but would need help from a human to navigate through a room.
The new and improved version was released in March of this year, complete with a head and new set of animated LED "eyes." Described as "human-centric" and "multi-purpose," Digit's intended use is in warehouses and industrial spaces, performing dangerous or strenuous tasks that often cause injury to human workers, such as moving heavy materials.
“Supply chains are still feeling the aftereffects of the pandemic, and the demand for warehouse labor far exceeds available talent. Companies are turning to automation now more than ever to help mitigate future disruptions," Shelton said in a press release at the time. "With logistics labor issues such as high turnover, burnout, and injury continuing to rise, we believe Digit to be the future of work."
While Digit seems to have big ambitions to climb the corporate ladder, the robot currently still has fairly limited functionality, relegated mostly to simple tasks such as picking up and putting down objects, walking and crouching.

At full capacity, the new factory will employ 500 human workers who will work alongside Digit robots to build, well, more robots. The robots already work in Agility's customer sites, moving, loading and unloading totes.
Company officials said they anticipate production capacity of hundreds of Digit robots in the first year, with the capability to scale to more than 10,000 robots per year.
"Digit is designed from the ground up to go where people go and do useful work, safely, in spaces designed for people," company officials said. "Because so many tasks are designed around human workflows, Digit’s human-centric design enables multi-purpose utility."
Customers in the company's Agility Partner Program can expect to receive the first Digit robots in 2024, according to the company. Digit is scheduled to be available in the general market in 2025 for a yet undisclosed price.

A NASA spacecraft will launch Thursday in a highly-anticipated mission though the solar system that scientists hope will reveal secrets about Earth's own core.
After years of planning and a year-long delay, NASA is planning to launch Psyche from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida on Thursday at 10:16 a.m. ET. Psyche is named for the asteroid to which it is headed to visit and gather information.
NASA is streaming the launch, with live coverage beginning at 9:15 a.m. ET Thursday. You can watch the launch at the video embed at the top of this page, or on NASA Television, the NASA app, NASA website and the agency's accounts on Twitch, X, Daily Motion and YouTube.
Once launched, Psyche is expected to take a six-year, 2.2 billion-mile journey to the Psyche asteroid, which orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter.

The two-day search for a missing special needs Michigan toddler ended in tragedy on Tuesday after authorities said they found his body in a creek bed near his home.
Germain Jones, 2, who was autistic and non-verbal, was reported missing early Monday afternoon, the Clinton County Sheriff's Office said.
Germain was last seen walking away from his home in north Watertown Township, a community about 15 miles northwest of Lansing, Michigan.
“It is with great sadness that we are reporting that the missing child was located deceased,” the department posted to its Facebook page about 5 p.m. Tuesday. "Please pray for the family during this tragic time."
Clinton County Sheriff Sean Dush confirmed the child's death in a 5:30 p.m. news briefing, saying he was found in the Looking Glass River.
Foul play is not suspected in the child's death, Dush said, but the case remained open on Tuesday.
A medical examiner will determine the toddler's cause and manner of death, officials said.

At least 300 volunteers and law enforcement members from multiple local and state agencies, searched for Germain throughout the day Monday and more than 500 were on hand Tuesday, Dush said in news conferences covered by WLNS 6, a CBS affiliate in Lansing, Mich.
The Lansing State Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network reported that two hours before the toddler's body was found, Dush had called "all hands on deck" in the search for Germain, who he said disappeared from his family's home about 2 p.m Monday after a babysitter left him alone briefly while taking a shower.
About 10 minutes later, Dush said, the babysitter noticed the boy was gone, briefly searched and called 911.
The boy was last seen wearing a blue sweatshirt with dinosaurs on it, a pair of shorts with shark images on it. He wore no shoes.
The temperature at the local Capital Region International Airport dipped as low as 42 degrees at 3 a.m. Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service Grand Rapids office, and remained in the low 40s later that morning.

Dush said dive teams had searched several area ponds and turned their attention to the Looking Glass River, which runs near the child's home. In addition, a Michigan State Police helicopter with thermal imaging, and drones aided in the search.
“We’re so fortunate in this county that people come together to take care of each other and that’s how it should be," Dush said during the news conference.

It sounded like fireworks. But it turned out to be the sound of missiles.
Dexter Noblefranca is among 44 people whose pilgrimage to Jerusalem – the "Holy Land" – from St. Patrick Catholic Church in Memphis, Tennessee, was cut short by destruction.
On Saturday, the group heard the missiles over the Israeli capital and it triggered a frightening realization, the priest told The Memphis Commercial Appeal, part of the USA TODAY Network. 
"I never thought in my life I would see war, but it’s really happening here," Noblefranca said. "Please pray for our safe travel home and the peace here in the Holy Land, especially the innocent people from Israel and Palestine that are dying."
The group left Jerusalem following the violence to a safe location as they awaited their flight home to Memphis on Tuesday.
The struggle to come home – and the fear for loved ones left behind in the deadly war zones of Gaza and Israel – is very real for many Americans as the world watches the violence abroad unfold.
The news moves quickly. We break it down for you. Sign up for USA TODAY’S Israel-Hamas War newsletter for a run-down of the day’s headlines.
The U.S. citizens longing to return to America include several people from church groups, including those in Naples, Florida, visiting Jerusalem for religious reasons, Salt Lake City-based Palestinian-Americans visiting family members and New Jersey Jewish residents who were celebrating the Simchat Torah holiday.
They told the USA TODAY Network that their trips turned from a tranquil, joyous crusade away from home into a catastrophic nightmare from which they needed to swiftly escape. Some Palestinian Americans told CNN they were abandoned by the US Embassy and told to use the Rafah Crossing into Egypt if conditions were safe.
Now panicked, they are struggling to return to the U.S. as American airlines cancel flights into and out of Tel Aviv and Israel escalates strikes on the Rafah border crossing path between Gaza and Egypt.
On Saturday morning, Hamas launched a surprise attack, launching a barrage of rockets and sending gunmen onto Israeli territory. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet declared a retaliatory war against Hamas and ordered its military factions in Gaza to undertake a "complete siege."
Israeli leaders have sent airstrikes into Gaza City, destroyed buildings including a 14-story tower and threatened to cut off essential needs including electricity, access to food and fuel, the news outlet Al Jazeera reported.
More than 1,600 people, including at least 14 Americans, have been killed so far and many others are missing. At least 900 people from Israel and at least 765 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Israel’s Army Radio and the Gaza Health Ministry, CNN and CBS News reported. The tension derives from decades of conflict between Palestinian territories and Israel, which has left tens of thousands of people dead and even more displaced, Al Jazeera reported.
Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines have halted flights into and out of Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport, joining several other airlines around the world, said representatives from the airlines. American Airlines flights are canceled through Friday, Delta flights are canceled through Oct. 31 and United flights are canceled indefinitely.
"Our hearts are with those who are impacted as our people work to find safe alternatives for customers trying to depart TLV," said Savannah Huddleston, a spokesperson for Delta, in an email to USA TODAY. "Delta will continue to explore options for customers to safely exit TLV via seats that become available on our partner airlines.”
There is congressional support to help people escape in other ways. In New York, Democratic Rep. Grace Meng is "calling on the State Department to help get her constituents out of Israel and back home to Queens."
"While I appreciate the steps the Biden administration is taking to provide additional security assistance to Israel, I urge the State Department to use all resources at its disposal to help those Americans that remain in Israel return to the United States," she wrote in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.
In Gaza, the U.S. Embassy is telling U.S. citizens "who wish to leave and can do so safely" to monitor the Rafah Crossing into Egypt. But the escape route they're recommending comes with risk as Israel attacks the border with missiles.
"U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness as security incidents, including mortar and rocket fire, often take place without warning," the U.S. Embassy wrote in an alert on Monday.
The uncertainty has affected Americans who live across the nation.
Another Catholic Church group from Naples, Florida, awaited their flight home from Israel, members gathered to pray for Jeruselum and visited holy sites. 
"We're going to turn the worries into worship, and we're going to turn fear into faith,” said the Rev. Alan Brumback, who is on the trip with his family, in a Facebook Live update according to The Naples Daily News, part of the USA TODAY Network.
Some of the 53 people from the First Baptist Church of Naples who traveled to Israel to visit holy sites flew home before a previously planned flight scheduled for Thursday, while others who had booked separately had their plans disrupted. The rest remain hopeful they will depart as planned, as many airlines have canceled flights due to the war, Brumback said.
Mark Schwartz, a councilman and volunteer firefighter in Teaneck, New Jersey, had traveled to Israel with friends for Simchat Torah, a Jewish holiday, with other Jewish people from New Jersey. He was expecting a joyous trip but now is rushing to get home. Flights out of the country were canceled and he and others resorted to booking tickets to Europe on El AI, the Israeli airline, hoping to get a flight home, Schwartz said.
"I got a flight to Bulgaria and will somehow get to New Jersey," Schwartz told NorthJersey.com, part of the USA TODAY Network. “Everyone is in a mournful mood."
In a phone interview with the news outlet on Monday, Schwartz said: "The sirens keep going off, and everyone has to run to a shelter, which is dark and not well stocked because nobody prepared for this.”
Another woman from New Jersey, Dena Levie, told the news outlet that her 20-year-old son was trying to leave the country to start school on time in the U.S.
"He's at the airport now and a siren just went off and he was told to leave his bags and run for the safe room with hundreds of other people," said Levie.
Hamas is also holding dozens of hostages in Gaza. They include Israeli civilians and military personnel, according to Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. Some Americans are among them, President Joe Biden said on Tuesday.
Officials are unsure exactly how many are in hostage situations, said Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. At least 20 Americans are unaccounted for, he said.

British TV host Holly Willoughby has quit "This Morning" after a man was arrested for alleged plans to kidnap and murder her.
"I've let ITV know today that after 14 years, I will not be returning to 'This Morning,'" Willoughby, 42, announced on Instagram Tuesday. "To everyone who has ever worked on the show over the years, thank you so so much. This is such a difficult goodbye, you are incredible and I forever will be proud of what we've done together."
The TV host went on to thank her co-workers for "being supportive," the guests who appeared on the show and their "wonderful viewers" for being "the very best company every day."
"I know this story has many chapters left to go. Sadly, however, I now feel I have to make this decision for me and my family," she concluded. "I will miss you all so much."
Willoughby did not directly address the arrest made in the alleged plot to kidnap her in her announcement of departing "This Morning."
Gavin Plumb, a 36-year-old man from Essex, was arrested on Oct. 4 for allegedly planning to kidnap and murder Willoughby, according to Sky News and BBC.
Plumb appeared at a hearing at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Friday where he was accused of "soliciting, encouraging, persuading, endeavoring to persuade or proposing to a third party" to murder Willoughby some time between Tuesday and Wednesday, per the BBC.
The suspect was allegedly "assembling a kidnap and restraint kit, capable of encouraging or assisting the commission of the kidnap" of Willoughby to hold her for the third party.
The third party was expected to arrive in the U.K. from the U.S. this week.
Willoughby had been off air of "This Morning" since Thursday amid the investigation.

Co-host Alison Hammond added: "We are obviously all shocked to hear the news and we want to send our love and biggest hugs to Holly and her family."
O'Leary and Hammond both expressed love and support for their co-host in the Instagram comments of her departure announcement.

WASHINGTON − The Biden administration is proposing a new rule to prohibit companies across the private sector from hiding fees from consumers, the president's most sweeping action yet on "junk fees."
The Federal Trade Commission's rule would require all industries under its jurisdiction to show the full price upfront to consumers, including for concert and sports tickets, hotel rooms, and apartment and car rentals. Violators would be subject to financial penalties and be required to compensate customers.
President Joe Biden, in remarks Wednesday from the White House Rose Garden, called the proposal his administration's "most comprehensive action ever" to eliminate junk fees.
"If these rules are finalized, they won't just be voluntary, they'll be made mandatory. It will do more than embarrass companies, it will make it mandatory," Biden said.
The move comes as Biden has made tackling junk fees a top priority to help consumers. Americans collectively pay "tens of billions of dollars" in junk fees each year, according to the FTC. Lina Khan, chair of the FTC, likened the fees to "an invisible tax that quietly inflates prices across the economy."
"Our proposed rule to ban junk fees would not just return money to people's pockets but also restore a degree of justice to American families and restore fairness in our markets," Khan said.
The rule will be subject to a public comments period before it can be formally adopted by the FTC.
Taking aim at the financial industry, the Biden administration is also warning large banks and credit unions that they can’t charge fees for basic services. Examples include routine checking of bank account balances or asking the amount needed to pay off a loan.
"Folks are tired of being taken advantage of and being played for suckers," Biden said.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will evaluate whether any existing bank fees violate provisions in a more than 10-year-old law that bureau director Rohit Chopra said requires large banks provide complete and accurate information to customers.
“Today's guidance outlines a pretty basic concept,” Chopra said. “When people request basic information about their accounts, big banks cannot charge them massive fees or trap them in endless customer service loops.”
Chopra touted recent oversight inspections of major financial institutions that led to $140 million in refunds for fees that shouldn’t have been charged.
For example, he said, one financial company charged monthly fees for paper statements that were never actually printed or mailed to customers.
The agency also will propose new rules to make it easier to switch a financial account and find better interest rates.
Biden's efforts on junk fees have nudged Ticketmaster and mobile ticket vendor SeatGeek to voluntarily agree to no longer hide fees from total ticket costs. Four major airlines companies have agreed to wipe away fees for families to sit together on planes.
Some of the many other rules changes proposed under Biden would lower credit card late fees, require cable and internet providers to list fees upfront, and force major broadband companies to display all costs and fees for services.
Be careful what you wish for, Dallas Cowboys.
As fallout lingers from the blowout loss at San Francisco, the Cowboys are so deep into their feelings about the 42-10 result that it’s fair to wonder if they are capable of recovering – physically and mentally.
During his podcast, "The Edge with Micah Parsons," the Cowboys' star linebacker took exception to the "(expletive) Dallas" T-shirt that 49ers tight end George Kittle wore under his jersey as he scorched Dallas for three touchdowns. Kittle revealed his wardrobe accessory on a social media post on Monday.
 "I just feel like he’s making it way more personal than it had to be," Parsons said Tuesday. "Kittle’s my guy, but I'ma say this: laugh now, cry later. We got something for that. If we see them again, just trust."
Trust the Cowboys? No way.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
The Cowboys, 28 years and counting since the franchise’s last whiff of Super Bowl glory, have proven (again) that they cannot be trusted as a legitimate contender. Maybe that changes by January. But that needs to be proven in the flesh as they’ve over-promised so many times before in morphing from America’s Team to America’s Biggest Tease. Such an identity remains intact about now.
At this point, any threats coming from the Cowboys about what they’ll do to the 49ers have zero credibility. Remember, Dallas was supposed to use the prime-time showcase on Sunday night as a measuring stick. And the 49ers basically took that stick and cracked the Cowboys on the butt with it.
The defense that Parsons leads? The Cowboys went to San Francisco with the unit allowing the fewest points in the league, like 10 points per game. They left as the defense that gave up six touchdowns and 421 yards and had a terrible time getting off the field on third downs.
So, again, any promises about what will happen if they see them again would be ill-advised.
Thus, the 49ers are still scoring points in this rout – of which Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said “may be the most humbling game I’ve ever been a part of” after he faltered in yet another big game – with the social media aftermath.
Deebo Samuel, the electric and versatile 49ers receiver, had a pointed response to Parsons’ take:
"It was always personal before the game started," Samuel told Kay Adams on the "Up & Adams" podcast. "42-10, I don’t think you wanna see us again. It might be a little worse."
Ouch. Or touchdown, 49ers.
Can we stick a fork in the Cowboys already and declare that this season is kaput? Maybe not yet. It’s the NFL, with its week-to-week reality checks. Look at what happened to Buffalo, a week after destroying the Dolphins: They went to London to get served up by the Jaguars.
This is not the time of year to draw conclusions about what will happen in January – even though it seems clear that if they stay healthy, the 49ers and Eagles will be major factors. And as long as Patrick Mahomes is in the lineup, the Chiefs have a shot.
Dallas? Perhaps the Cowboys (3-2) peaked with a 40-0 beatdown of the Giants on opening night. A week after handing Bill Belichick the worst margin of defeat in his career, blasting the not-so-good Patriots, 35-3, Mike McCarthy suffered the most decisive loss in his three-plus years as Cowboys coach.
"It’s been a wide range of performance, as wide a range that I could ever recall in a 5-week period," McCarthy said after the debacle on Sunday night.
On paper, the Cowboys are not done yet.
There are 12 games left. Just one of Dallas’ next six opponents – Philadelphia (5-0) – currently has a winning record. A path to get back into the race in the NFC East still exists, given the two matchups looming against the Eagles in November and December. Then again, the Eagles will be just as eager as the 49ers to demonstrate a special kind of animosity toward Dallas.
In any event, the expectation correction for the Cowboys has just happened. After showing that figuratively they don’t belong on the same field with the 49ers, the Cowboys find themselves facing a must-win predicament when meeting the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium on Monday night.
Never mind the subplot of facing a Chargers offense now orchistrated by Kellen Moore, the former Cowboys coordinator. It’s about survival, or at least rebounding to restore some confidence after absorbing so many blows during the humiliating loss on Sunday night.
As Kittle, of all people, pointed out on Sunday night, there’s also a pattern to watch when it comes to what happens after teams play the 49ers. Kittle suggested that there’s a residual effect.
"We’re a violent, physical football team," Kittle said, alluding to the smashmouth style on offense that complements a punishing defense. "That’s the standard of the 49ers. Last year, every team that played us lost the next week."
It’s a striking pattern. Including the playoffs, teams that played the 49ers last season were 0-15 in games the following week. The Chiefs won their next game after facing San Francisco last October, but it came after Kansas City had a bye week. And the Eagles had a bye week following the NFC title game, although it indeed lost in the Super Bowl.
Pittsburgh snapped the “next-week” streak last month. Blown out by the 49ers in Week 1, the Steelers rallied to defeat Cleveland the following week. The next three 49ers opponents, though, followed suit with last season’s pattern and lost the following week.
Now the trend is attached to Dallas’ challenge to get back on track after a grueling loss to the 49ers. 
Tony Pollard, the Cowboys running back limited to 29 rushing yards at San Francisco, was upbeat on Sunday night when assessing how they can rebound.
"Get back to work," Pollard said. "Go back to the lab. You have to prepare. You have to get ready and brush it off. We’ll see this team again, so we have to lock in for the next one."
See the 49ers again? Officially, that’s a maybe for the Cowboys this season.
No, the Cowboys likely can’t achieve the dream of winning a championship without getting past the 49ers. But considering the way San Francisco has owned them in recent years, the Cowboys had better be careful of what they wish for.
Another day, another thing to celebrate. Wednesday is National Coming Out Day (NCOD) in the U.S., a day meant to bring attention and support to members of the LGBTQIA+ community and the many ways they choose to share their identifies with the world.
The term "coming out" is abbreviated from the commonly used phrase "coming out of the closest," a metaphor used to describe the process of an LGBTQIA+ person revealing their identity to the people around them.
While the term sounds like it refers to a single moment in time, being "out" can mean something different for everyone and often includes a longer process of accepting one's own identity before sharing with a chosen group of people and the world at large.
Happening on Oct. 11 every year, NCOD exists not only to encourage and support people in sharing their authentic selves with the world, but also brings awareness to the experiences -- and challenges --members of the LGBTQIA+ community face when deciding how and when to disclose who they are.

National Coming Out Day is celebrated on Oct. 11 every year in the U.S. and is sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC).
Besides offering public support and encouragement to people still in the closet, in the process of coming out or who are already proudly out, it also aims to increase visibility around the LGBTQIA+ community.
Members of the community (and allies!) are everywhere and initiatives like NCOD serve to remind people not only that the community is present and should be supported but also drives home the importance of acceptance and education.
“The spirit of National Coming Out Day has always been that the most powerful act of resistance as an LGBTQ+ person is to live our life loudly in a world that tells us to be quiet,” President of the Human Rights Campaign Kelley Robinson, said in a statement. “The hard truth is we still live in a world where it is hard for many LGBTQ+ people to come out publicly for fear of interpersonal or institutional harm. For those of us for whom it is safe to come out, it is crucial that we do so vocally and make it clear that we will not stand for anything less than the equality we deserve."
National Coming Out Day was founded in 1988 and inspired by the March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights that occurred the year before.
On Oct. 11, 1987, 500,000 people participated in the march past the White House and through the National Mall, demanding an end to sexual orientation discrimination and asking for more funding for the fight against AIDS, which had become a highly deadly epidemic in the U.S. at that point.
Rob Eichberg and Jean O’Leary, prominent activists who headed organizations The Experience and the National Gay Rights Advocates respectively, first proposed NCOD to commemorate the monumental moment that was the 1987 march.
Eichberg, who later died in 1995 due to complications from AIDS, said in interviews before his death that one of the most important components of the movement and, by extension, NCOD is helping people realize how many LGBTQIA+ people exist in society and even in their owns families, social circles and lives.
"Most people think they don’t know anyone gay or lesbian, and in fact everybody does," he once said, according to his New York Times obituary. "It is imperative that we come out and let people know who we are and disabuse them of their fears and stereotypes.”
The Human Rights Campaign announces a new theme for NCOD every year, such as “Coming Out Still Matters" or the first ever-theme in 1999, "Come Out To Congress.” 
This year's theme is “Coming Out Against Hate," which encourages allies to join "with HRC and countless LGBTQ+ people to stand up against hate in schools, libraries, and everywhere they live, work, and play."
Taking public action is especially vital this year, said HRC, thanks to the hundreds of pieces of legislation aimed at attacking LGBTQIA+ people in the last year alone. This legislation remains at an all-time high, said HRC, which prompted the organization to declare a National State of Emergency in June.
“While significant progress has been made for the LGBTQ community in recent years, we still have a long way to go in the U.S. Right now, many LGBTQ young people report living in homes or communities that are unaccepting of LGBTQ people," Keygan Miller, Interim Director of Public Training LGBTQ youth advocacy organization The Trevor Project told USA TODAY.
"It’s also important to consider the context of our current political environment. More than 650 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in states across the country this year alone. The dangerous rhetoric we hear from lawmakers about these bills trickles down into LGBTQ young people’s everyday lives, and can impact the ways in which they are treated."
Trips for trans travelers:Trips can bring joy to trans travelers. Here are tips to make the most of your getaways.
According to HRC, there are an estimated 20 million LGBTQ+ adults and more than 2 million LGBTQ+ youth in the U.S. Every person's journey to finding their voice and sharing their identity is different, but access to support and resources are helpful to any and everyone, allies and loved ones included.
The HRC has released three new Coming Out Guides for people who may need advice and guidance to honor NCOD. They also offer webinars and an entire coming out resource page, which features intersectional guides regarding coming and living out for people of different demographics and backgrounds.
People looking for a local group in their own community can use the websites' "in your area" tool to find local groups, ways to participate and volunteer and what activity the HRC is involved in near you to support LGBTQIA+ people.
The Trevor Project is an organization which aims to end suicide amongst LGBTQIA+ youth. Their website is chockfull of helpful links, information and access to mental health services.
Perhaps most importantly, their website offers a free, 24/7 suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth which can be accessed via text, online chat or phone. Staffed by trained counselors, the hotline is available 365 days a year.
They also offer TrevorSpace, an "affirming, online community for LGBTQ young people between the ages of 13-24 years old" with over 400,000 members across the globe, offering a potential lifeline of companionship to people looking for support outside the people in their offline lives.
Like HRC, The Trevor Project has a Coming Out Handbook and resource center full of valuable information for people at any stage in their journey.
Keygan Miller told USA TODAY resources on their site, such as the handbook, can help allies looking to support their loved ones as well as LGBTQ people.
"Coming out is a very personal, individual journey that can look very different for each LGBTQ person. There is no right or wrong way to come out, and there are plenty of valid reasons for why a person may choose not to come out," they said.
“It is important for anyone considering coming out to know that they are deserving of being loved, respected, and supported exactly as they are. For any young person who feels unaccepted by the people around you – know that that is on them."
The SAGE National Resource Center on LGBTQ+ Aging recognizes that not only young people struggle with the prospect of coming out. An organization focused on supporting and connecting older members of the community, their website includes not only a wealth of information for LGBTQIA+ older adults and their families, but any person looking to get involved.
The center also offers their own hotline specifically for older LGBTQ+ people which runs 24/7, 365 days a year and is staffed by people certified in handling crisis situations.
They also offer information and referral forms to connect LGBTQ+ older people and their families with aging services, a technical assistance program that provides best practice information to aging network providers, programming to support further education and research for the community and local opportunities to volunteer.
You can also use their state search tool to find local resources or check their coming out later in life guide.
Another resource aimed at youth, specifically people in grades K-12, GLSEN focuses primarily on education and awareness. GLSEN helps to develop inclusive curriculum, supportive educators, safer school environments and opportunities for people to participate in local chapters, trainings and find help with education-based resources.
They have also created their own coming out guide.
If you are struggling with your identity and experiencing a crisis, suicidal thoughts or are in need of someone to talk to, contact the Trevor Project 24/7 hotline at www.thetrevorproject/get-help/, by phone at 1-866-488-7386 or by text at 678-678.
So California’s liberal Gov. Gavin Newsom has enacted a law known as the “Skittles Ban,” and it cruelly attacks the four thing all righteous Americans hold dear: brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and Red Dye 3.
The law will ban the sale, distribution and production of these traditionally delicious food additives, which are used in thousands of products we eagerly put in our mouths. Newsom’s attack on tastiness doesn’t actually impact Skittles – thank the rainbow! – because brave candy advocates persuaded lawmakers to exclude titanium dioxide from the list of banned additives. (Everyone knows it’s the titanium dioxide that gives Skittles their flavorful pop.)
Still, the four unjustly targeted additives will require producers of certain food-like comestibles to change recipes by 2027 if they want to sell their products in the most-populated state in the country.
What kind of newfangled communism is this? And since when does a governor have the power to tell me when and where I can guzzle brominated vegetable oil?
Here are a few of the endangered products: Peeps; Pez; Fruit By the Foot; Hostess Ding Dongs; Brach’s Candy Corn; and Yoo-hoo Strawberry Drink.
THAT’S MY FOOD PYRAMID, YOU NANNY STATE MONSTER!!!
Like most sensible patriots, I start each day pounding five seasonally appropriate Peeps and washing the marshmallow-like goop down with a bottle of Strawberry Yoo-hoo, the only beverage bold enough to look like milk while actually being water and high-fructose corn syrup.
It’s delicious, nutritious-ish and causes an insulin surge that keeps the walls of my arteries in a state of constant inflammation or, as I like to call it, “readiness.”
But Newsom and his propylparaben police want to rob me of that breakfast tradition. Am I now supposed to start eating fruit NOT by the foot?!?
Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, said in a statement about the new California law: “We’ve known for years that the toxic chemicals banned under California’s landmark new law pose serious risks to our health. By keeping these dangerous chemicals out of food sold in the state, this groundbreaking law will protect Californians and encourage manufacturers to make food safer for everyone.”
Well, lah-di-dah. I don’t recall asking for government protection from chemicals I don’t understand and didn’t technically realize I’m eating. But if you think knowing that Red Dye 3 has been found to cause cancer in animals and has been banned from use in cosmetics for more than three decades would stop me from making my annual Thanksgiving candy corn casserole, think again.
Look, California, if I’m Hoover-ing Pez into my pie-hole and washing Ding Dongs down with Yoo-hoo, as is my God-given right as a corn-syrup-based citizen of this world, I’ve pretty much committed to a ride-or-die lifestyle.
So you’re going to have to pry the Peeps and potassium bromate from my cold, dead, Red-Dye-3-stained hands. Which, according to these actuarial tables, you should be able to do in about a month and a half.

When most people quip that they're "a bit OCD," they probably just mean they're a neat freak.
For Howie Mandel, it means much more than that.
Though the "America's Got Talent" judge didn't receive his diagnosis for obsessive-compulsive disorder until his 40s, the 67-year-old says OCD has had a profound impact on most of his life. This OCD Awareness Week, which falls the second week of October, the comedian is partnering with NOCD, a company that provides video-based OCD therapy.
"The word 'suffer' is not even strong enough," he says of his experience with the condition, while speaking over a Zoom call from Las Vegas. "If I think I got a germ on my hand, I can't think or hear anything else. I just have to get that germ off my hand. Then I'll wash my hand ... stay in the bathroom, keep wiping, miss a birthday party, miss an important event, miss work, and I just can't move past this brick wall of horror."
That wall has gotten easier to deal with, he says, thanks to a combination of medication and therapy, but it's still something that's always there − which is why it's frustrating when well-meaning fans claim they experience the same thing, when it's clear they don't.
"A day doesn't go by (without someone saying,) 'I know you're a germaphobe. I got a bit of OCD too.' Well, I don't know that you do," he says. "There's a big difference between being a little bit neurotic and having OCD."
OCD is not that uncommon:Understand the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder.
According to Mayo Clinic, OCD involves persistent patterns of unwanted thoughts and fears, known as obsessions, that lead to repetitive behaviors, known as compulsions.
Ignoring or trying to stop these obsessions can worsen anxiety, so people with OCD are often driven to perform compulsive acts in an attempt to relieve stress. These patterns can be time-consuming, interfere with day-to-day life and cause significant impairment.
Examples of obsessions include fear of contamination and intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way. Compulsions can take the form of hand-washing to the point of damaging the skin, repeatedly checking the stove to make sure it's off or counting in certain patterns.
Mandel recalls how his OCD once drove him to check if a door was locked so many times it occupied him for hours.
"It's just this vicious, dark circle, and it makes you... unproductive, unhappy, depressed," he says. "Sometimes there are people that have this that even end in suicide. It's not a good thing, but the deal is that there is an answer, and there is help out there."

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic proved especially difficult for Mandel, who has an OCD-driven fear of germs and famously avoids shaking hands.
The comedian says he coped with the added stress the way he has with many hardships: with humor. Still, he says, laughter can only do so much.
"For somebody who was triggered by germs, COVID was not helpful," he says. "I made a lot of jokes, and people do make jokes, like, 'You were right, Howie. Now everybody needs to wear gloves and wash their hands.' But it was hell and really affected me, and I'm traumatized by it."
There has been at least one upside to the pandemic for Mandel: his podcast "Howie Mandel Does Stuff," which he co-hosts with his daughter Jackelyn Shultz, who's also diagnosed with OCD. He says the two got the idea for the project while finding ways to cope with the stress of early COVID life.

On the "AGT" set, Mandel says his fellow judges are understanding and considerate of his condition and everyone he works with is "so open about mental health." He also praised his co-judge Simon Cowell, 64, for recently revealing he went to therapy to help treat his depression.
Mandel says it can be especially intimidating for people of his and Cowell's generation to share their mental health struggles.
He hopes that by speaking out he can help change that stigma.
"I think the younger you are, the easier it is to be open about mental health," he says. "The reason I have that strength is because not only me, not only my daughter, but a lot of people are expanding the ability to share."
Plus, he says, the more people acknowledge their imperfections, the more they acknowledge their humanity.
"I feel broken ... but I don't know what perfection is," he says. "I don't know what fixed is. I think that everybody's got a little break in them. I think some people aren't aware of it. ... I don't know that there is perfection with anybody."

The USA TODAY Opinion section publishes analysis, argument and essays on a wide variety of subjects. We're looking for timeliness (pegged to news), persuasion pitched to the other side, new information, novel arguments, revelatory insights, passion without partisanship, first-person experience, original reporting that reveals fresh angles and makes news, expert knowledge, and/or a topic that will drive conversation on social media and in the real world.
We accept only pieces that are submitted exclusively to USA TODAY. We do not accept material that has been published on blogs, social media or anywhere else.
Columns typically run 550 to 750 words. They should be pasted directly into an email and sent to theforum@usatoday.com. Pieces should include links (URLs, not headlines or footnotes) to back up quotes and factual material. People featured in columns must be identified by their real, full names.
We do not publish open letters, class projects or material that has been submitted to multiple outlets. Rebuttals to editorials and columns published in USA TODAY should be submitted as letters to the editor, not as full-length op-eds.
Due to the volume of submissions, we can’t respond to all columns sent to us. If our Opinion team is interested in yours, you will hear from us within three business days.
Submissions may be edited for accuracy, clarity, style, standards and length. 
Please include with your submission a short biography, two sentences at most, to run at the end of your column, as well as a current photograph, to which you own publishing rights. If you or a business, trade group or other institution with which you are associated stands to gain financially or in any other way from your column, you should disclose that information in detail. In most cases, it should also be included in the body of the piece or in the author's biographical information.
Columns are accepted for online publication; print publication is not guaranteed. All columns published by USA TODAY are available for use online and in print by the more than 250 properties in the USA TODAY Network. They include Austin; Bergen County, New Jersey; Burlington, Vermont; Cincinnati; Columbus, Ohio; Des Moines; Detroit; El Paso, Texas; Indianapolis; Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Milwaukee; Nashville, Tennessee; Phoenix, Reno, Nevada; Palm Beach, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware.
Authors may post their columns elsewhere 48 hours after they are published at USA TODAY. By submitting a column to USA TODAY and agreeing to its publication, authors are granting exclusive rights to the piece to the USA TODAY Network for 48 hours and non-exclusive rights thereafter.
