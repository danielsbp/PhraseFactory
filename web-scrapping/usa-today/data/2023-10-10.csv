The 2024 election cycle has kicked off. Though Election Day is over a year away, the race is well underway. 
President Joe Biden announced he will seek another term, and with former President Donald Trump's hat also in the ring, a rematch of their 2020 race is a real possibility. Though the Democratic establishment is expected to fall firmly behind Biden, the Republican side is more of a toss-up. 
Trump-endorsed candidates suffered in the midterm elections, and with his legal troubles mounting, the GOP may consider other options. Polls still show Trump with a strong lead however, and many of those trying to unseat him have floundered including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
DeSantis who generated early buzz has suffered in the polls, struggling to translate popularity in Florida to popularity at the national level, and recently firing much of his campaign staff in a major shake-up.
Here are the latest developments on the path to the 2024 election: 
And here are the candidates who have announced their intention to run for president in the 2024 election: 
Joe Biden ∣ Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ∣ Marianne Williamson ∣ Ryan Binkley ∣ Doug Burgum ∣ Chris Christie ∣ Ron DeSantis ∣ Larry Elder ∣ Nikki Haley ∣ Will Hurd ∣ Asa Hutchinson ∣ Perry Johnson ∣ Mike Pence ∣ Vivek Ramaswamy ∣ Tim Scott ∣ Francis Suarez ∣ Donald Trump ∣ Cornel West
Political party: Democrat
Age: 80
Family: Biden has spoken candidly about grief throughout his political career. He lost his first wife Neilia Hunter and their one-year-old daughter Naomi in a 1972 car accident shortly after winning his first Senate race. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were injured in the crash but survived. In 2015, Biden lost Beau to brain cancer and has made it a major political goal to champion cancer research.
He remarried in 1977, tying the knot with now-First Lady Jill Biden. The two share a daughter, Ashley, and a large clan of grandchildren.
Biden's son Hunter has been the subject of scandal in recent years and has written about his struggles with drug addiction. The GOP-led House has seized on Hunter's business dealings, hosting hearings to investigate his finances and the potential influence he has on his father.
Previous political experience: Joe Biden is a veteran of the Senate. First elected in 1972, he served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected as vice president on the Obama ticket in 2008.
After serving two terms as vice president, Biden took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.
His views: Biden's campaign is focused on the "battle for the soul of America," doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago. He said the question facing the nation is "whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer."
Political party: Democratic
Age: 70
Family: Williamson was married once in the late 1970s to a Houston businessman whom she has not named. She has one daughter, India Emmanuelle, whose father has not been publicly identified.
Previous political experience: Williamson is a self-help author and spiritual leader who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020. Then she was largely drowned out by a crowded Democratic field, breaking through for a rare viral moment, but eventually written off as a non-traditional candidate whose views involved centering the "politics of love" and rejecting a “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred.”
Her views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans. She has suggested creating a U.S. Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy, and a U.S. Department of Peace.
Party: Republican
Age: 55
Family: Binkley met wife Ellie in college and the two share five children.
Previous political experience: Binkley is CEO, president, and co-founder of the mergers and acquisitions conglomerate Generational Equity Group. He is also a faith leader, having co-founded and serving as the pastor at Create Church in Richardson, Texas. 
The 2024 run is Binkley's first foray into politics. He says he wants to stand out in a crowded field by prioritizing unity, and leaning on his faith and business experience.
His views: Binkley has said he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform, and putting more community emphasis on education. Binkley is against abortion. Though he signed a highly restrictive bill in his own state, he had indicated he would not do the same nationally and it should be a local issue. Binkley advocates for American energy independence using an "all of the above" approach that encompasses both fossil fuels and new technologies.
Political party: Republican
Age: 66
Family: Burgum wed Karen Stoker in 1991 and the two had three children: Joe, Tom, and Jesse before divorcing in 2003. He remarried in 2016, tying the knot with current wife Kathryn.
Previous political experience: Burgum comes from a business background, once serving as SVP of Microsoft and founding both a real estate and venture capital firm. He was elected governor of North Dakota in 2016 and reelected in 2020.
Burgum’s candidacy is expected to focus more on economics than culture wars – a favored topic of frontrunners Trump and DeSantis.
His views: Burgum has emphasized economic issues, rather than hot-button cultural issues that have been a focal point for some other GOP candidates. He is a vocal supporter of the oil industry, and the U.S. role in exporting it to other nations, and has said he favors smaller government and lower taxes.
Party: Republican
Age: 60
Family: Christie met wife Mary Pat at the University of Delaware and the two wed in 1986. They share four children: Andrew, Sarah, Patrick and Bridget.
Previous political experience: Christie was appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey in 2002 and served for six years. He was elected governor of New Jersey in 2010 and occupied the office until 2018.
Christie has been a prominent figure in the GOP since he launched his first presidential campaign in 2012. He ran again unsuccessfully in 2016 and, despite prior criticism, ultimately endorsed Trump and later joined his campaign.
His views: Christie is anti-abortion, but does support some exceptions in the case of incest, rape, and danger to the mother. He is not for a federal ban, instead believing the issue should be left to the states. He has advocated for a more secure border to stem the flow of fentanyl into the country and is in support of U.S. aid for Ukraine.
Political party: Republican
Age: 44
Family: The governor wed former television host Casey DeSantis in 2009 and the couple share two daughters Madison and Mamie and one son Mason.
Previous political experience: DeSantis serves as the 46th governor of Florida. His national profile grew during the pandemic when he spoke out publicly against mask mandates and pushed to keep many Florida businesses and schools open. Since then, he has captured national attention with controversial legislative measures on education and immigration.
While in law school, DeSantis joined the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer, later deploying to Iraq for active duty. Prior to his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.  
He is widely viewed as Trump’s biggest threat in the Republican primary. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to the former president.
His views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida. He is in favor of "defending parental rights and eliminating CRT," and is anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment.
Political party: Republican
Age: 70
Family: Elder has no children and has been married once. The couple divorced after two years and Elder was engaged again to Alexandra Datig from 2013 to 2015. Amid his candidacy for California governor, Datig went public with an allegation that Elder had once brandished a gun at her while high on marijuana.
Previous political experience: Elder is a lawyer and conservative talk show host who mounted a campaign against California governor Gavin Newsom in 2021's recall election. Though he lost, Elder received the highest number of votes of any candidate besides Newsom.
Elder announced his candidacy on Fox News' "Tucker Carlson Tonight," tweeting afterward "America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable. We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That’s why I’m running for President."
His views: Elder backs school choice, including vouchers and charter schools. His platform also includes a vow to be tough on crime, to secure the border, and to "contain China" by asserting military dominance in the South China Sea and minimizing reliance on the country's manufacturing.
Political party: Republican
Age: 51
Family: Haley is one of four children born to Indian-American parents in Bamberg, South Carolina - a town she has described as divided by race.
She and her husband of 26 years, Michael, live still in South Carolina where they are raising two children Rena and Nalin.
Previous political experience: Haley started her political career in the South Carolina state legislature where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful campaign for the governor's office in 2010. She won reelection in 2014 and has bragged that she has "never lost a race."
In 2016, former President Trump nominated Haley to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down in 2018. Haley has played up her role as a female candidate in what is expected to be a largely male primary field. "May the best woman win,” she quipped in an interview with Fox News.
Her views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel. She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and "getting tough" on China and Russia. She has supported Trump in the past but also criticized him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.
Political party: Republican
Age: 45
Family: Hurd wed Lynlie Wallace, a fellow political operative, in 2022. The two first met in 2009.
Previous political experience: A former CIA officer, Hurd served three terms in Congress representing Texas in the House after first being elected in 2014.
His views: Hurd stands out from an increasingly crowded GOP field as a rare vocal critic of Trump. He joins the likes of Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson in publicly disavowing the former president and in his campaign launch video listed illegal immigration, inflation, crime, and homelessness as legislative priorities.
Political party: Republican
Age: 72
Family: Hutchinson has been married to wife Susan since 1973. The two share four children and seven grandchildren.
Previous political experience: Hutchinson has had a long career in Republican politics. He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to serve Arkansas' 3rd district in 1997; he served until 2001 when he was appointed DEA administrator and later undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security for the George W. Bush administration.
While in the House, Hutchinson served as impeachment manager in the trial of former president (and fellow Arkansas native) Bill Clinton. After leaving Washington he was elected 46th Governor of Arkansas. He served for two terms, from 2015 to 2023.
His views: He supports lower taxes, a strong national defense, and opposes abortion. He has said the Biden administration "stood on the sidelines" in the face of crime and “turned its back on the American worker."
Party: Republican
Age: 75
Family: Johnson tied the knot with wife Diane in 2008, and the pair share three sons.
Previous political experience: A businessman trying his hand at politics, Johnson built his wealth with the launch of Perry Johnson Registrars Inc., a company that ensures auto, aerospace and other businesses are complying with industrial standards. In 2022, he threw his hat in the ring for the GOP nomination for Michigan governor before being disqualified because of invalid signatures.
His views: Johnson told a group of Iowa voters in July that he was "pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, anti-woke and anti-China," − and "if you don't like it, well, tough." His campaign's signature "2 cents" proposes cutting 2 cents off every dollar of federal discretionary spending.
Party: Republican
Age: 63
Family: Pence wed wife Karen in 1985 and the two share three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.
Previous political experience: Pence entered politics in 2000 when he won his local congressional seat. He went on to serve six terms in the House of Representatives before being sworn in as governor of Indiana in 2013.
In 2016, Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate, and he served one term as Vice President. The role thrust him into a precarious situation in 2021 when Trump sought to pressure him to throw out some of Biden's electoral votes to overturn the election.
Pence ultimately defied Trump and certified the results, infuriating MAGA voters and Trump himself. His candidacy will likely involve a difficult tightrope walk as he attempts to distance himself from the former president without alienating the base.
His views: Pence is a vocal opponent of abortion, and of what he sees as the nation's long-term debt problem. He favors cuts in government spending and lower taxes, and while he often touts his time as vice president and speaks well of the policies that came out of the Trump White House, he has begun to distance himself from his former running mate in terms of tone. He has also criticized Trump's actions during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.
Political party: Republican
Age: 37
Family: Ramaswamy married Apoorva Tewari, a throat surgeon and assistant professor at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in 2015. The pair have two sons together. 
Previous political experience: Ramaswamy is framing himself as an outsider, an entrepreneur-turned-political-hopeful who will give the establishment a run for its money. 
He is a former biotech investor who founded pharmaceutical research company Roivant Sciences in 2014. Ramaswamy left the company in 2020 amid clashes with colleagues over how to respond to the murder of George Floyd and the public outcry that followed. He now heads up Strive Asset Management. 
He is the author of three books, including "Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam," which explores how American politics and capitalism have become increasingly intertwined. 
His views: He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action and eliminating the Department of Education. His elevator pitch: He'll go farther than Trump ever did or could today.
Political party: Republican
Age: 57
Family: Scott is unmarried, with no children. He was raised by a single mother in North Charleston and has one brother.
Previous political experience: Scott first entered politics in 1995 during a special election for City Council in Charleston. His profile grew nationally when he suggested posting the 10 Commandments outside the council building, a proposal that was denied.
Scott served for two years in the state legislature before being elected in 2010 to the House of Representatives for South Carolina's 1st district. He served one term before being appointed to the Senate by then-governor Nikki Haley and becoming the first Black U.S. senator from the state.
Scott is pitching himself as a more hopeful alternative to Trump, drawing on Reagan-era ideals and centering a tone of optimism.
His views: Scott joined the Senate in 2013. He’s anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment. He says on his website that his “signature legislation,” Opportunity Zones, put $75 billion into “distressed communities” across the country.
Political party: Republican
Age: 76
Family: Trump is the son of real estate magnate Fred Trump. Born and bred in New York, he first made his name developing skyscrapers and casinos.
Trump first married in 1977, wedding Czech-born model Ivana. The two were married for 13 years and share three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. In 1993 Trump married actress and model Marla Maples. The two had one daughter: Tiffany. Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron.
Trump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr. and Eric were often cited as close advisors.
Previous political experience:  When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to "drain the swamp."
Prior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in "The Apprentice."
In 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.
His views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats. He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.
Party: Democratic
Age: 69
Family: Kennedy bears a powerful last name in Democratic politics. He is the son of Robert F. Kennedy, the former attorney general who was assassinated during a 1968 presidential run, and the nephew of former president John F. Kennedy. Though he originally launched his campaign as a Democrat, Kennedy is now running on an Independent ticket.
Kennedy has been married three times and has six children. He wed current wife Cheryl Hines in 2014. Hines is a television star best known for her role on "Curb Your Enthusiasm."
Previous political experience: Kennedy is an environmental lawyer known for trumpeting a debunked theory that vaccines can be linked to autism.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates, calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times used the Holocaust as a historical comparison. In 2017, former President Trump invited Kennedy to head up a presidential commission on vaccine safety. 
His views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the "liberties guaranteed by the Constitution," according to his campaign website.
Political Party: Green Party
Though West originally announced his candidacy under the People's Party, he later officially filed as a Green Party candidate.
Age: 70
Family: West has been married five times and has two children. He wed current wife Annahita Mahdavi in 2021.
Previous political experience: Dr. Cornel West is an American academic and philosopher known for his progressive ideals. He has taught at a number of Ivy League institutions and works now as a professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary. 
In a video uploaded to Twitter, West announced his 2024 candidacy saying, "I enter in the quest for truth, I enter in the quest for justice." As a third-party candidate, West alleged "neither political party wants to tell the truth" on various issues. His bid with the People's Party represents the first independent ticket to enter the race thus far.
His views: West is a proponent of Medicare for All, and removing oil and gas subsidies as well as drilling on public lands. Long a vocal opponent of militarism, West's campaign website lists "end the wars" as a key priority which would include disbanding NATO and banning nuclear weapons across the globe.
Political party: Republican
Age: 45
Family: Suarez is the son of another prominent Florida politician: Xavier L. Suarez, who was Miami's first Cuban-born mayor. He is married to Gloria Fonts Suarez, and the two share one son and one daughter.
Previous political experience: Suarez serves as the 43rd mayor of Miami, a seat he has occupied since 2017. Prior to that he was Miami City commissioner and served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2022 to 2023.
Views: Suarez has said he did not support Trump in either 2016 or 2020, instead using his ballot to write in the names of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and Former Vice President Mike Pence respectively. As mayor, Suarez has championed growing Miami's tech economy, and he has also backed low taxes and increased police spending.
This story will be updated as additional candidates officially enter the race.
WASHINGTON − Hamas has claimed it, Iran has denied it and the U.S. and Israeli governments say they don’t – as of yet – have any direct evidence the Tehran government was behind the deadly Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel.
But a senior U.S. official said late Monday that Iran certainly is complicit in funding Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement, providing weapons to it and training its paramilitary forces.
Analysts say such complicity could have a significant impact on a rapidly intensifying crisis that until now has been limited to battles between Israeli and Hamas forces.
The Biden administration said Monday that at least 11 Americans have been killed in the terrorist attacks. And the White House confirmed it believes at least some Americans are among the hostages Hamas operatives abducted and brought back with them to Gaza.
The militant Islamic group is one of two major political parties that rules over at least 2 million Palestinians in Gaza. The U.S., European Union and dozens of nations have designated Hamas a terrorist organization for its armed resistance to Israel, but it pales in comparison to Iran and another of Tehran’s proxies, Hezbollah, when it comes to terrorist reach and capability.
"Iran would be suspect No. 1 in a lineup” of suspects who could give Hamas the ability to launch the stunning terrorist attacks against Israel by air, land and sea and take it by surprise, said Andrew Borene, a senior U.S. intelligence and counterterrorism official until four months ago.
“That doesn't mean that they're guilty,” Borene told USA TODAY in an interview. “It means there's a reason that they're being investigated" for a possible role in the attacks.
Iran "has historically been the largest state sponsor of terrorism," said Borene, whose last job was as a senior executive in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. "And they are the most active state sponsor of terrorism. So it's not without cause that people are investigating that thread."
Here’s what you need to know about Iran, Hamas, and the attacks in Israel that some experts are saying is the country's 9/11.
More:Israel responds to barrage of rockets sent by Hamas militants with air strikes
The Biden administration has been careful in saying it has no evidence of a “direct” Iranian role in the attacks.
On Monday morning, principal deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said the Biden administration is investigating, but it lacks “direct information” that Tehran was behind it.
Finer was asked about Iran’s possible role in the attacks by ABC’s "Good Morning America" host George Stephanopoulos, who cited a Wall Street Journal report that said Iranian security officials "helped plan Hamas’s Saturday surprise attack on Israel and gave the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut last Monday." The Journal cited senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah, another Iran-backed militant group.
“So taking a step back, I think what we can be quite clear about is that Iran is broadly complicit in these attacks, for having supported Hamas going back decades, for having provided financial support, for having provided training, for having provided weapons to Hamas,” Finer said. “What we don't have is direct information that shows Iranian involvement in ordering or planning the attacks that took place over the last couple of days.”
Asked whether the White House believes the Wall Street Journal report was inaccurate, Finer said: “What I can tell you is we have no direct information to confirm that report. We've obviously seen it. We're looking into it, but we do not have the ability to corroborate it at this time.”
The Israeli military also has said there is no concrete evidence of Iranian involvement in the Hamas attack from Gaza. “Iran is a major player, but we can’t yet say if it was involved in the planning or training,” said R Adm Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces.

For its part, Iran has denied any role in the attack.
Tehran’s mission to the United Nations said Sunday that Iran was not involved in one of the bloodiest attacks in Israel's history, when Islamist group Hamas killed hundreds of Israelis and abducted perhaps 100 more.
"The resolute measures taken by Palestine constitute a wholly legitimate defense against seven decades of oppressive occupation and heinous crimes committed by the illegitimate Zionist regime," Iran's U.N. mission said in statement, according to a Reuters report.
For all their denials about finding a direct connection, U.S. officials have been quick to say that Iran has a history of supporting these kinds of attacks, and Hamas in particular.
White House spokesman John Kirby said Monday night that there’s “no question there's a degree of complicity here.”
“Iran has been supporting Hamas for many, many years with tools, training, capabilities, certainly rhetorically but in much more tangible ways than that," he said. "So absolutely, there's a degree of complicity here, writ large."
The U.S. would continue “looking through the information streams” to find any connections, and hard evidence that Iran was directly involved planning, launching or carrying out the sets of complex attacks Hamas pulled off over the weekend, Kirby said.
''Obviously, nobody's walking away from the fact that Iran has long supported Hamas,” he said.
The Wall Street Journal report raised alarms in Washington, in part because of the specificity of the allegations.
Citing a variety of sources, the Journal said in its report Sunday that the Revolutionary Guard, the main political branch of the Iranian military, had attended biweekly Hamas planning meetings in Beirut since August, including two also attended by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was one of several lawmakers briefed on the Hamas attacks by the Biden administration.
In a CNN interview, Coons said Iran has a history of supporting others in their acts of war and terrorism. And he said that in this case, it is especially under suspicion because Hamas publicly thanked Tehran “for their funding, their training, their contributions for this horrific attack on Israeli civilians.”
Iran, Coons said, is Russia’s partner in its brutal war in Ukraine, providing drones that are carrying out deadly attacks on civilians.
It has funded, trained and armed Hezbollah, the Shite militia in Lebanon that also has attacked Israel with rockets. And Iran has sent its Revolutionary Guard fighters into Syria, where they can threaten Israel from the northeast, he said.
“And it is Iran that has funded and trained Hamas that has carried out this attack from Gaza,” Coons said. “So, whether or not there is specific intelligence about a direct Iranian role in planning this specific attack, there is lots of evidence of active engagement by Iran in supporting the organizations and groups that have caused chaos in the Middle East now for years.”
Yes. As President Biden and his top aides have stressed repeatedly, the U.S. is a staunch ally, and the two nations share many security goals and strategies in the Middle East and beyond. As such, they are extremely close when it comes to sharing even the most sensitive and timely intelligence.
Biden "has also spoken with many of our allies and partners, including the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, just this afternoon to help coordinate our efforts," Kirby told reporters Monday night.
According to a White House statement, Biden "directed his team to follow up on coordination with Israel on all aspects of the crisis and to continue their work with regional partners to warn anyone who might seek to take advantage in this situation."
It's also clear that various U.S. intelligence agencies, especially the CIA and the National Security Agency, have devoted considerable resources to understanding the intentions of Iran's civilian government leadership and the mullahs, or religious clerics who wield significant power within the country.
At a security conference this summer, CIA Director Williams Burns acknowledged Iran is meddling in the Ukraine war by sending weapons and other help to its ally Russia. And more broadly, Burns said, "in terms of our commentary on intelligence we collect about what’s going on inside the Iranian leadership."
On Saturday, Burns was set to be the keynote speaker at another security conference in Sea Isle, Georgia, but canceled at the last minute because of the Gaza attacks, said Borene, who was at the conference.
And each year, Burns and other U.S. intelligence agency leaders provide a worldwide threat assessment to Congress and say they are intensively investigating Iran’s connections to a wide array of terrorist groups.
Determining what role, if any, Iran played in the attack could take weeks, months or even years if history is any guide, said Borene, who is based in London as executive director of Flashpoint National Security Solutions, a risk intelligence platform.
And in the meantime, he said, authorities need to be very careful about pointing fingers – especially when it comes to an adversary as capable as Iran.
“The crisis is ongoing, and it is simply too early to assign culpability when Iran is denying even indirect involvement,” Borene said. “All government agencies are wise to move slowly in their forensic and detective work before leveling accusations of even indirect Iranian support. Especially when the stakes are as high as they would be in the event of Iranian involvement in these terrorist attacks.”
On Monday, there was widespread public and media speculation that Iran was behind the attacks. One national security reporter posted on X, formerly Twitter, that “Iran's goal is to draw the US into a broader conflict: senior intelligence source tells me.”
But some experts said that’s not Iran’s modus operandi.
“Sorry, not believable,” tweeted Joel Rayburn, a former career Army officer and Trump administration State Department and White House National Security Council official focusing on Iran and the Middle East.
“At no time in his 34-year rule has Ali Khamenei wanted a “broader conflict” with the United States,” Rayburn said of the supreme leader of Iran. “That’s why he uses proxies. And it’s why whenever the US retaliates strongly against him, he backs off.”
Biden administration officials have said no, at least for the time being.
At his briefing Monday night, White House spokesman Kirby was asked specifically whether the U.S. would intervene militarily in the conflict, especially if Iran or Hezbollah are found to be responsible – or if they join to attack Israel.
“There's no intention to put U.S. boots on the ground,” Kirby said.
But he added that the Biden administration already has ramped up its presence in the region, including sending the massive Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group into the eastern Mediterranean as a message to Iran and Hezbollah.
“President Biden will always make sure that we are protecting and defending our national security interests wherever those interests are, including particularly in that part of the world,” Kirby said. “And I think I'll leave it at that.”

President Joe Biden will give remarks Tuesday afternoon after Israel declared war on the Gaza strip over the weekend following deadly surprise attacks by Hamas.
USA TODAY will be providing live coverage beginning at 1 p.m. ET. You can watch at the video at the top of the page or on USA TODAY's YouTube channel.
More than 1,600 Israelis and Palestinians have died since the conflict began, including at least 11 Americans, and thousands more injured. Hamas has claimed to have taken more than 130 hostages, and Israel has ordered a siege on Gaza pledging to cut electricity, food and fuel to the impoverished home of more than 2 million Palestinians.
In a statement, Biden’s National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said: "The United States unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians. There is never any justification for terrorism.”
Biden has also condemned the Hamas attacks in an address, saying the U.S. stands with Israel, and his administration's support for Israel's security is "rock solid and unwavering."
Live updates:Israel regains control over Gaza Strip border; rocket attacks intensify
Israel intensified its assault on Gaza Tuesday, stepping up rocket attacks and tightening a blockade on food and fuel as the war sprawled into a fourth day.
The Israel Defense Forces said it regained control over the border with Gaza Strip early Tuesday, three days after Hamas militants crashed through the barrier and launched an invasion that saw over 1,000 Israelis killed or kidnapped. At least 11 Americans are among the dead, U.S. officials said.
Israeli Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said the bodies of 1,500 militants were found around southern Israel. Hundreds more have been killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, Hamas health officials said.
A spokesman of Hamas’ armed wing, Abu Obeida, said the group will kill one Israeli civilian captive any time Israel targets civilians in Gaza “without prior warning.” Israel's Arab-language channels and social media platforms have been giving Gazan residents evacuation instructions during the Israeli bombardment.
French President Emmanuel Macron, supporting statements from U.S. officials, said his country has no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack. Involvement of Iran, which has denied playing any role in the war, could threaten to expand the war.
Developments:
∎ President Joe Biden will speak Tuesday in a display of U.S. support for Israel. The address comes three days after Biden gave brief remarks declaring "the United States stands with the State of Israel"
∎ Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday blamed failed U.S. foreign policy for the war. Moscow has been talking to both Israel and the Palestinians to help search for a settlement, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.
∎ The United Nations health agency says the medical supplies pre-positioned in seven Gaza hospitals have already been used up.
Israeli retaliation:Could be felt 'for generations'; FBI searching for Americans impacted by attack
Tehran was not involved in the attack by Hamas but Israel is to blame for the war, Iranian leader Ayatollah ali Khamenei said Tuesday. Iran, however, also has denied providing drones to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine despite extensive evidence that the armed drones were Iranian-built.
The Tehran Times said Khamenei, at a graduation ceremony for military cadets, praised the Hamas militants and said Israel and its supporters must know that Israel's retaliatory bombardments targeting Gaza will lead to “a heavier slap on their ugly face."
“When injustice and crime exacerbate, when savagery reaches its height one should wait for a storm,” Khamenei said.
Israeli Defense Forces, IDF, said it killed Hamas Minister of Economy Jawad Abu Shamala. The IDF said he funneled money for financing and directing terrorism inside and outside Gaza. Abu Shamala previously held security positions and led several operations aimed at Israeli citizens, the IDF said.
An IDF aircraft also killed Zakaria Abu Ma'amr, a senior member of the Hamas Political Bureau and the head of the Ministry of National Relations, the IDF said. The IDF said Abu Ma'amr "did a lot of work to incite and act against the sovereignty of the State of Israel and endanger its residents." He also belonged to the organization's senior forum and was involved in the organization's decision-making and planning of terrorists attacks, the IDF said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was attempting to gain access to people being held on both sides to provide medical care and learn news of their fate for their loved ones. Fabrizio Carboni, regional director for the Near and Middle East, said kidnapping is prohibited under international humanitarian law and that anyone detained, including combatants, must be treated "humanely and with dignity." Health care workers must be protected to ensure people needing help can receive treatment, he said.
“The violence directed against civilians is appalling and cannot be justified," Carboni said in a statement. "If the situation continues to escalate, then civilians on both sides will suffer immensely."
The U.S. and Israeli governments say they don’t – as of yet – have any direct evidence that the Tehran government was behind the deadly Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel that continued through Monday. But a senior U.S. official said Monday night that Iran certainly is complicit in funding Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement, providing weapons to it and training its paramilitary forces.
Analysts say it could have a significant impact on a rapidly intensifying crisis that until now has been limited to battles between Israeli and Hamas forces.
Iran "has historically been the largest state sponsor of terrorism," said Andrew Borene, former senior executive in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. "And they are the most active state sponsor of terrorism. So it's not without cause that people are investigating that thread."

Is Iran behind Hamas terrorist attacks?What it would mean for US and Middle East security
Aryeh Ziering was raised Israeli, but had American parents. He lived in a mixed Hebrew and English speaking neighborhood. He spent summers in Maine, loved baseball and hiking and felt a sense of duty as a soldier in the Israeli Defense Forces. Ziering, 27, a captain in a canine unit who served in the Israeli military for six years, was killed Saturday.
"We're shattered," said his aunt Debby Ziering, who lives in Connecticut. "I know they prepare for war but you never really think that it'll be your family. It's just so hard." Read more here.

More than 30 University of Florida students were sent to a local hospital late Monday after a vigil for victims in Israel erupted in chaos with students trampling over others. Rabbi Berl Goldman with Chabad UF said he was with school President Ben Sasse at the “United with Israel” candlelight vigil at UF's Turlington Plaza when someone in the crowd fainted or fell, and people began yelling "911," campus police said. Earlier accounts of the incident included some fearing they heard gunshots, though no shots were fired. It is believed that the person's bag or items dropped to create a loud noise.

The Israeli military estimated 1,000 Hamas fighters crashed across the Israeli border Saturday, igniting a rampage that included shooting hundreds of civilians and kidnapping people who were transported back to Gaza. Hamas, the largest Palestinian militant group, also has fired rockets from Gaza that have riddled Israeli cities.
Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ military wing, said “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm,” was a response to activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem that is the third holiest site in Islam. The site, which is also located on the holiest site for Jews − who refer to it as the Temple Mount − has long been a flashpoint between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli security services routinely raid the compound.
“Enough is enough,” Deif, said in a recorded message. “Today the people are regaining their revolution.”
But diplomatic connections developing between Israel and some Arab nations have been a concern to Hamas and to Iran. The war could compel those Arab nations to choose a side.
Ripples of fears and countless prayers for an end to the violence traveled through Jewish, Israeli and Palestinian-linked communities in the United States this week. Some groups held prayer meetings while others worried about local attacks, immediately beefing up security and urging community members to be vigilant as the death toll overseas from the battle climbed.The attacks came toward the end of Sukkot, a weeklong celebration marking the time Jews lived in the desert after escaping slavery in Egypt. As news of the tragedy spread, many Jewish and Israeli communities in the United States shifted from celebrating to holding vigils and protests.
“There’s an unspoken deep bond and connection that no matter where we are, we have this shared pain,” said Melissa Chapman, chief executive officer of the Jewish Community Center in Berkeley, California. Read more here.

Maps and graphicsshow how Hamas militants' deadly raid unfolded – and how fighting will get worse
Gaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian exclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − less than 150 square miles, it is less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel, a southwestern border with Egypt and its western border is on the Mediterranean Sea.
Hamas won 2006 parliamentary elections elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power, and the U.S. and the European Union are among global entities that have consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
Deif leads the military wing while Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh are the senior leaders of Hamas. Haniyeh has warned Arab countries against making diplomatic inroads with Israel.
“We are on the verge of a great victory and a clear conquest on the Gaza front," he said in a speech broadcast Saturday on Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV. "Enough is enough, the cycle of intifadas and revolutions in the battle to liberate our land and our prisoners languishing in occupation (Israeli) prisons must be completed.”
Hamas was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or Islamic resistance movement. The group’s charter calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel. The militant organization is committed to the destruction of Israel and has been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., the EU and various nations. The political wing of Hamas has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2007.
It was founded by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist organization with ties to Egypt. Iran provides Hamas with financial, material and logistical support and it also cooperates with Hezbollah, another Iran-backed, U.S.-designated terrorist group, based in Lebanon.
The dispute is rooted in pre-biblical times. Though its borders have shifted over the years, Palestinian territories used to be what is now Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. Both Israeli Jews’ and Palestinian Arabs’ history, culture and identity are linked to the Palestinian territories. Jewish migration from eastern and central Europe surged from 1922 to 1947 as Jews fled persecution and the destruction of their communities, most notably during World War II. As the number of Jewish immigrants increased, many Palestinians were displaced. They began pushing back and violence resulted.
In 1948, the Jewish People's Council met in Tel Aviv and established the State of Israel. The U.S. officially recognized the new nation later that day; the USSR acknowledges it three days later. Read more here.

Former baseball star Steve Garvey announced Tuesday that he is entering the race for a U.S. Senate seat in California, hoping to succeed Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who died last month.
The 74-year-old Garvey is a Republican.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom selected Laphonza Butler, an adviser to Kamala Harris' 2020 presidential campaign to fill Feinstein's vacant seat, which will be occupied until the 2024 election. Butler has not said if she is going to run for the full six-year term.
No Republican has won a U.S. Senate seat via election in California since 1988.
Garvey says he is focusing his campaign on quality-of-life issues, public safety, and education.

"I never played for Democrats or Republicans or independents. I played for all of you," Garvey said in a video, announcing his candidacy. "It’s going to be a common sense campaign."
Garvey played 19 seasons in the major leagues with the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1969 to 1982 and for the San Diego Padres from 1983 to 1987. He was a 10-time All-Star, won four Gold Gloves at first base, and was the National League MVP in 1974.
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is standing by his embattled starting quarterback saying he still believes that Dak Prescott can take them to the Super Bowl.
Jones' weekly appearance on 105.3 The FAN comes days after the Cowboys were embarrassed on national television on "Sunday Night Football" by the San Francisco 49ers in a 42-10 rout.
Prescott threw for 153 yards, was intercepted three times and sacked three times against the 49ers.
"Dak Prescott is a quarterback that can get us to the Super Bowl and that’s the way that’s going to be. I want to be real clear: Dak’s very capable of making this team be where we want it to go," Jones said during the radio interview. "We should recognize that we had a very bad outing. And San Francisco had a very good outing.
"But as far as sitting here saying we should completely change out the towels here, that’s not even in the cards. And it’s really ridiculous."

Jones was also asked if things continue to sputter on the offensive end if he considered head coach Mike McCarthy giving Cowboys playcalling duties to offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer.
"No," Jones said. "In any way, no."
The Cowboys' offense ranked third in total yards and fourth in scoring offense last season. Through five games in 2023, Dallas is 18th in total yards and eighth in scoring offense, averaging 26.8 points a game.

The arrest of three Florida teenagers last week may have prevented an attack on a high school where the suspects had identified potential targets and acquired aerial photos of the campus to map out their plot, authorities said.
Text messages that the boys exchanged revealed the identities of other students who the teenagers planned to target in their attack at Creekside High School in the Jacksonville suburb of St. Johns, according to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office. Deputies reportedly discovered that the texts included the encircled photographs of the intended targets, as well as their class schedules and home addresses.
The trio also sent one another aerial photographs of the high school, according arrest reports provided Tuesday to USA TODAY.
All three of the students — two 14-year-old boys and a 15-year-old boy — were arrested Thursday and each were charged with two felony counts related to accusations regarding their written threats and also that they had unlawfully used communications devices. USA TODAY does not identify juveniles charged with crimes.
“Nothing is more important to me than the safety of our children," St. Johns County Sheriff Rob Hardwick said in a statement on Facebook. "I am proud of the youth services deputies assigned to this investigation, who acted quickly on the information that was provided and prevented a potential tragedy."

After being bullied, the students had formed what deputies described in the arrest reports as a "Russian communist group" that they named "the United Boyopolis Socialist Republic."
The group created a logo that they placed on a patch as an identifying insignia and distributed applications to recruit other members into their organization, arrest reports state.
Not long after, the teens began formulating a plan to attack the school in multiple conversations in a group text messaging chat, where they also discussed the potential use of weapons, according to the arrest reports.
One conversation between the charged trio and another unnamed individual contained both a "hit list" of students they wanted to hurt and a "lethal hit list" of students they wanted to kill, according to the reports.
One of the charged students was accused of sending a text in the chat saying "I'm nothing without a weapon." In another exchange, one of the students said "I'm bringing my AK-47 tomorrow," prompting one of the accused to respond: "me too."
The students made it clear in the exchanges that the plan "was not a joke," which prompted the unnamed member of the group chat to become "concerned and fearful enough" to report it to school officials, deputies wrote in the reports.
Deputies with the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office were notified Sept. 29 about the texts and launched an investigation, obtaining and examining two of the suspects' phones, Lt. George Harrigan, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, told USA TODAY.
Harrigan said Tuesday that it remains "undetermined" whether the teens had access to any of the weapons they discussed to carry out their attack. The investigation remains ongoing.
All three students were suspended effective last Tuesday, Harrigan said. The St. Johns County School District did not immediately respond Tuesday morning to USA Today's request for comment.
Vermont:1 dead, 1 injured after Amtrak collides with SUV
The potentially foiled plot comes as school shootings rise nationally and as gun violence rages in the Jacksonville area, where shootings have recently left 20 people injured and seven dead in a five-day period.
In late August, a 21-year-old man entered a Jacksonville Dollar General wielding a rifle emblazoned with a swastika, where he fatally shot three Black people in a racist attack before turning the gun on himself.
Just last week, two people opened fire during a dispute between two groups at Morgan State University homecoming events in Baltimore, Maryland, wounding five people who authorities do not believe were the intended targets of the shooters.
Unfolding on a university campus, the shooting was at the time the latest to take place in an academic setting.
Shootings with casualties at public and private elementary schools more than doubled in the 2021-22 academic year, which marked the second year in a row that school shootings in the U.S. hit a record high. Of the 188 shootings at American elementary schools, 57 included fatalities, according to the most recent federal data.
Last year’s figure of 93 school shootings was the highest in two decades.

WASHINGTON — From fiery debates over controversial issues to promises for swing state voters, high-profile factors typically sway the results of a presidential election.
But sometimes, these factors come in the form of a state-level race a year out from Election Day. In less than a month, Pennsylvania voters will cast their ballots in the state’s 2023 Supreme Court race between Democratic candidate Dan McCaffery and Republican candidate Carolyn Carluccio.
The judge they elect could shape the 2024 presidential election.
In recent years, lawsuits over voting issues and allegations of election fraud have rocked Pennsylvania. After the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging Philadelphia officials violated state law while ballots were being tallied, which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed.
Contentious debates around Act 77, Pennsylvania’s mail-in-voting law, have also landed at the state’s Supreme Court.
But if arguments over ballots, polling places and other voting questions emerge in the 2024 presidential election, whoever is elected to the state's Supreme Court this year could be crucial as these fights play out in Pennsylvania.
"The state Supreme Court often ends up being the final arbiter of these kinds of disputes," Dan Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State University, told USA TODAY.
Here's how this state-level race could have major implications for the 2024 race for the White House.
McCaffery, a Pennsylvania superior court judge, told USA TODAY he was inspired to launch his campaign by recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions affecting Americans across the country.
He pointed to the high court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year, ending the constitutional right for women to have an abortion, as well as rulings on the First Amendment and LGBTQ rights.
“I thought it was important for me - someone with my experience -  to kind of jump into the race,” he said, describing his career as "in pursuit of social justice."
Though he hasn’t ruled on election litigation, McCaffery said that, broadly speaking, officials should "be looking to include votes, not looking for ways to disqualify votes based upon perceived technicalities.”
If Trump loses the 2024 race, the former president may bring allegations of election fraud to the Pennsylvania court.
“If he has a matter in front of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and I'm on it, he will get a fair and final opportunity to present his case fairly, and then I will make an impartial decision on the merits of the case,” McCaffery vowed.
Carluccio, a judge for the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, told USA TODAY she believes "Pennsylvanians want and deserve a just a judge who is impartial and fair, and a judge who applies law and uphold the Constitution."
She pointed to her time as a federal prosecutor representing victims of crime. And, though she hasn’t ruled on election litigation, she has served as a member of the board of elections in Montgomery County.
“I am not an activist judge,” Carluccio said.  “I cannot emphasize that enough. It is not my role, nor should it be any judge's role to change the law or to write the law or to implement policy.”
She has previously criticized Act 77, Pennsylvania's mail-in voting law. Earlier this year, she told a Republican forum that "Not much I can say, but I can tell you that Act 77 has been very bad for our Commonwealth," the Associated Press reported.
But Carluccio told USA TODAY she would apply the act, since it is state law, adding that “election laws must be applied consistently." However, she argued that there was inconsistency with the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court's rulings on undated and incorrectly dated ballots.
"It's not how they ruled," Carluccio said. "It's more that there was a little inconsistency there and people were confused. And again, our electorate deserves to understand the laws."
Pennsylvania is known to be a swing state in presidential elections, but the state’s Supreme Court race could also be a close battle as voters weigh both candidates.
Mona Cohen, a 69-year-old retired special education teacher in Philadelphia, thinks that McCaffery "has stood for equal rights for a very long time."
He “will preserve the right of everybody to vote, and the right of everybody to have unfettered access to vote and not have to face obstacles.”
“I think he's well rooted in fairness. I think that's a guiding principle,” she said.
Tina Burns, a 58-year-old healthcare consultant in Tamaqua, said "I truly believe our democracy is on the ballot, not just in 2024 but in the judicial elections, such as the 2023 (race), hence my vote going for Dan."
But Hamlet Garcia, a 52-year-old insurance agency owner in Upper Holland, said she values that Carluccio "will be a judge who will follow the law and not be a political activist."
"The judicial branch of government is supposed to interpret the law, not make the law. So I think that's what she would do,” referring to Carluccio’s record as a judge and public defender.
Michelle Nestor, a 50-year-old real estate agent and home improvement contractor in Mechanicsburg, agreed, saying she believes Carluccio "does not sway to either side. I believe she truly shows blindness to the law.”
When asked about election cases, Nestor said she believes Carluccio “will go into it with the utmost integrity.”
“I think it's important to everyone, no matter which side of the aisle you're on as a candidate, voting integrity is huge, and it's an important issue,” Nestor said. “And if anything were to arise from next year's elections that would be seen in front of the courts. I know that she would definitely uphold the Constitution and the law at the time."
The composition of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has become more competitive in recent years, according to Wesley Leckrone, the chair of political science at Widener University.
“Democrats took a 5-2 majority after winning three races in 2015. Republicans won an open seat election in 2021 to keep the status quo split on the Supreme Court,” he said. “Recent races have been contentious and flooded with campaign money. 2023 is no different.”
Currently the court has a 4-2 Democratic majority, following the death of Justice Max Baer. If Carluccio were to be elected, the majority balance between parties wouldn’t change, but she would narrow the margin. 
Michael Nelson, a political science professor at Penn State University, explained that courts often have to decide "hyper-partisan" issues, and as long a Democrats maintain control, "this election isn't likely to change the results of a lot of salient decisions."
But the race could chip away at the court's Democratic majority, especially if justices split on issues in the future. J.J. Abbott, executive director of Commonwealth Communications, who was a press secretary to former Pennsylvania Democratic Governor Tom Wolf, said that some cases are nuanced, and Democrats could take opposing viewpoints.
In cases where the courts have deadlocked, the results of this election could have big implications.
“With a current 3-3 split over counting un or mis-dated ballots, there is the potential for this election to help determine whether they should be counted,” Leckrone said. 
He added that if the 2023 race did result in a narrower 4-3 Democratic majority, future elections could flip the majority on the court, resulting in potential challenges to Act 77.
Craig Green, a professor of law at Temple University, predicted that that Carluccio’s election could cast a long shadow in the state ahead of 2024, stretching beyond races for judges.
“Carluccio’s election in 2024 would signal an immediate red shift in Purple Pennsylvania,” Green said. “It might also shift future elections in a red-leaning direction.  And both of those things might be signs of more changes to come."
More than 1,600 people have died, including at least 11 Americans, and fighting continues after the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched thousands of rockets from Gaza against Israeli cities and sent an estimated 1,000 gunmen across Israel's border to attack and kidnap civilians Saturday.
The coordinated assault, the deadliest attack on Israel in decades, caught the nation and the world by surprise. Israeli Defense Forces responded with airstrikes and rocket attacks against cities inside the Gaza Strip.
For Israel, the attack "could be a 9/11 and a Pearl Harbor wrapped into one," IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told Agence France-Presse. At least 900 Israelis have died, Israeli media reported.
"Never before have so many Israelis been killed by one single thing, let alone enemy activity in one day," he said.

Dozens of Israelis, and an unknown number of Americans, were taken hostage and are being held in locations across Gaza, USA TODAY reported.
Israel formally declared war Sunday and said it would use “significant military steps” to retaliate. U.S. officials expect Israel will launch a ground incursion into Gaza soon, The Washington Post reported.
Palestinian authorities said more than 680 have been killed by Israeli counterattacks in Gaza. Each side reported thousands of wounded. More than 123,000 people in Gaza have been removed from their homes, according to the United Nations.
President Joe Biden condemned the attack Saturday and reaffirmed American support for Israel. The Pentagon is sending military aid, including the USS Gerald Ford Strike Group, to the eastern Mediterranean, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement.
Hamas said it attacked Israel in response to mounting Palestinian suffering under Israeli occupation and blockade of Gaza, The Associated Press reported. The 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt has decimated Gaza's economy, according to the Guardian.
Hamas is a militant Islamic group in the Gaza Strip. It's one of two major political parties and rules over at least 2 million Palestinians. The U.S., EU and dozens of nations have designated Hamas a terrorist organization for its armed resistance to Israel.
Hamas and Israel have clashed many times.
Islamic Jihad is the second-largest militant group in the Gaza Strip, according the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington. It is a Sunni Islamist militant group that wants an Islamist Palestinian state that is committed to the destruction of Israel, the center says.
The attack began with thousands of rockets fired from inside the Gaza Strip into Israel early Saturday. About an hour later, Hamas gunmen crossed the Israeli border at different locations and began attacking residential areas and military bases.
It took place on Simchat Torah, a holiday near the end of the weeklong Jewish festival known as Sukkot, or the Feast of Tabernacles.
It also fell on the 50th anniversary of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, in which Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year.
Hamas militants killed an estimated 260 people at the Supernova music festival in a section of open desert near Kibbutz Re’im, about 2 miles from the Gaza border. An unknown number were taken hostage.
Thousands attended the event, including some American and British nationals. The attack began with rockets fired from Gaza. Then armed militants arrived in vans, shooting people as they tried to flee.
Zaka, Israel’s rescue service, said paramedics had recovered at least 260 bodies. The death toll could rise as teams clear the area, The Associated Press reported.

Israel's Defense Ministry said mortars fired from Gaza hit the Erez border crossing into Israel, used by thousands of Gazans daily. The mortars damaged the roof and shrapnel hit the hall's entrance, the ministry said. The crossing has been closed amid the fighting.
Israel’s defense minister says electricity, food, water and fuel to Gaza will be halted as part of a “complete siege” of the nation.
Israel launches strikes inside Gaza on Monday morning. Several mosques and a marketplace are hit and an unknown number of people are injured. The Yassin Mosque near the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City is among those destroyed.
The Israeli military says it's conducting one of the largest airstrikes ever against Hamas in Gaza and says more than 1,200 targets were hit.
Hamas seized dozens of people as hostages from various locations during its attack and have detained them in Gaza. The exact number isn’t known, but the hostages, from Israel and other countries, include “civilians, children and grandmothers,” an IDF spokesperson told CNN.
A Hamas spokesperson said Monday the group will kill one civilian hostage each time Israel targets civilians in Gaza without warning.
A Hamas official said Saturday that the hostages could be freed in exchange for Palestinian terrorists serving prison sentences in Israel.
The U.S. is sending the USS Gerald Ford Strike Group to the eastern Mediterranean, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Sunday. Those Navy ships include:
The U.S. is also preparing to add air power, including F-35, F-15, F-16, and A-10 fighters, to Air Force squadrons in the region. 
U.S. airlines have suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv. American, Delta and United have issued travel waivers for rebooking.

The chicken may be getting an upgrade.
In a scientific first, U.K. researchers have used gene editing technology to create poultry that's partially resistant to bird flu infection, according to a study published Tuesday in Nature Communications.
It’s no bionic chicken. But study authors say growing disease-resistant chickens in the lab is an important first step to giving farmers a tool to combat bird flu, which wiped out tens of millions of chickens amid an H5N1 outbreak over the past two years
Though experts say gene editing in poultry could have many benefits, they also warn that more research must be done to prevent possible unintended consequences.
“It’s still very early stages in terms of getting this up and running to chickens worldwide, but it’s a really neat first step,” said Ceili Peng, a doctoral student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is working to encode heritable resistance to diseases in animals.
But Peng is aware of the consequences of pushing forward too quickly.
“It’s definitely worth exploring some of the consequences of our genetic edits.”
Scientists in the study made the genetic changes to germ cells and injected the gene-edited cells into chicken eggs.
The gene they edited, called ANP32A, is a protein that supports the influenza virus once it invades the host cell, study author Wendy Barclay said at a media briefing last week. Scientists aimed to prevent the virus from using this gene to replicate.
“This strategy could be used not just for H5N1 (bird flu virus) but for any of the strains because it’s fundamental to the way the virus works,” she said.
The germinated eggs grew into adult chickens, which scientists bred with others to generate more gene-edited chickens while monitoring the flock’s growth, behavior and health. Once they determined the edited gene did not hurt the chickens’ growth, they sent the flightless birds to a containment facility to test their resistance to bird flu.
Researchers infected both gene-edited and regular chickens with a low dose of the bird flu virus and allowed them to interact with one another in the facility. They found the gene-edited chickens were “almost entirely” resistant to infection.
“The results are pretty cool,” said Peng, who is unaffiliated with the study.
The resources farmers have on hand to prevent bird flu infection are pretty limited, experts say.
Farmers could increase biosecurity by keeping poultry inside, instead of allowing them to roam free, to prevent contact with infected wild birds. They also could vaccinate the entire flock, but that can be time-consuming, costly and less effective against the latest bird flu strain, said Dr. Meghan Schaeffer, a zoonotic influenza epidemiologist.  
In theory, study authors say, gene editing should protect against any type of flu strain, prevent infection and eradicate transmission among domesticated chickens.
“It could save ... chickens’ lives, an enormous amount of money and not interrupt the food supply,” said Schaeffer, who is also the national public health adviser for SAS, a statistical programming company for epidemiologists and data scientists.
Protecting poultry also drastically reduces the risk of transmitting the bird flu virus to mammals, including possibly to humans, experts say. The transmission of the disease across species became a growing concern in the most recent bird flu outbreak when it began spilling over into wild animals, including otters, seals and foxes, among others.
“You take a major player out of the picture if you deal with domestic poultry,” Schaeffer said.
As with all technological advances, experts warn of unintended consequences – and one such consequence may have already been detected in the study released Tuesday.
Scientists who exposed the gene-edited poultry to a higher dose of bird flu virus – 1 million units rather than 1,000 – reported a breakthrough infection in half the chickens. When researchers looked at the virus that had sickened half of their birds, they realized it had already mutated in the chickens.
The mutations didn’t appear harmful when introduced to human cells in the lab, but experts said more menacing mutations could sprout.
“We do have to be very vigilant as a field because evolution is really powerful,” Peng said.
She also stressed the importance of studying how gene-edited chickens could affect the environment and ecosystems. Making poultry resistant to certain diseases could give them a fitness advantage Mother Nature did not intend.
There’s more work to be done before flu-resistant chickens become a viable option for farmers.
One reason is that study authors tested a common but a less pathogenic bird flu strain, H9N2, not the H5N1 strain that wreaked havoc in birds around the world. Researchers said in last week’s briefing the latest strain was tested on new cells in the lab and had favorable results, but they have yet to infect the highly transmissible strain into chickens.
Experts also said more research is needed to learn how consuming gene-edited chicken could affect people, Peng said. On a broader scale, the federal government will first have to figure out how to regulate gene-edited animal products before Americans can start ordering up flu-resistant chicken wings.

Thousands of people across the U.S. gathered Monday for vigils and protests over the rapidly intensifying war between Israel and Palestinian militants.
More than 1,600 people have died in Israel and Gaza, including at least 11 Americans, and thousands more injured since Hamas launched its stunning attack on Israel Saturday. The militant group has claimed to have taken more than 130 hostages. Israel has since ordered a siege on Gaza, pledging to cut electricity, food, and fuel into the impoverished home of more than 2 million Palestinians. 
On Tuesday, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees said that it has been struggling to accommodate over 187,518 Palestinians in Gaza displaced by ongoing Israeli strikes as hospitals and schools that it runs across the Gaza Strip were damaged in the fighting.
In Rhode Island, the Jewish Alliance of Greater Providence hosted a vigil Monday evening in response to the crisis across the globe. "It feels like a total nightmare," said Stephanie Hague, chief policy officer for the alliance. Hague said her in-laws in Jerusalem have been taking cover in a bomb shelter, and that her father and stepmother were in Israel to attend a wedding that has since been canceled and are now trying to get a flight back.
Rabbi Sarah Mack, senior rabbi of Temple Beth-El, said the community was celebrating Simchat Torah when the attacks began. The holiday marks when the Torah reading cycle restarts again and is a time of gratitude and rejoicing with Torah scrolls.
“It is a sad and devastating time. This is not even one degree of separation for most people in the Jewish community,” Mack said. The temple is offering support as members of the community try to account for loved ones’ whereabouts, she said.
"This is not far from anyone. It has broken the hearts of many people in the community," Mack said. "The Jewish community is gutted by this."
In Ohio, politicians, Jewish leaders, and private citizens packed two auditoriums at a prayer vigil Monday night, as Jewish leaders led attendees in prayer and song. 
Organizers at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Columbus called people to light candles for those affected by the war, including the relative of an Ohio family who had died in the attack. Politicians including state representatives, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, and U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, attended Monday’s vigil.
Event organizers called on people to ask their political representatives to push for aid to Israel.
 "Today Ohioans and Americans all over our great country are united with one message: We stand with Israel," Brown said.
But some in the community have voiced support for Palestinians they say have long suffered injustices at the hands of Israel, and are now concerned about what will happen to civilians as a result of Israel's declaration of war against Hamas. The Ohio State University chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, a pro-Palestine organization with chapters at universities around the United States, held a rally Sunday at the Ohio Statehouse attended by nearly 100 students and other community members.
"Today, October 7th, 2023, an unprecedented series of events have taken place, led by our heroic resistance in Gaza who have shown the world yet again that the spirit of the Palestinian people cannot and will not be trampled, and that our resistance to Zionism and Western imperialism remains strong," the group wrote in a Facebook post before the Statehouse event.
More than 1,000 people gathered at the Turlington Plaza at the University of Florida for a vigil Monday night, when a sudden loud noise sent the crowd into a frenzy, and more than 30 people to the hospital.
Rabbi Berl Goldman with Chabad UF said he was with university president Ben Sasse at the “United With Israel” candlelight vigil when someone fainted or fell down. He believes their bag or items dropped, creating a loud noise. 
Campus police said people began calling out "911," which was misunderstood by some nearby, and the crowd began screaming and running for safety. People fell and tripped over each other, witnesses said. More than 30 students were taken to UF Health Shands Hospital for their injuries.
UF Public Safety posted on social media that only five people were injured and treated on the scene.
In Rochester, New York, Palestinian supporters rallied at the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park. Jonathan Corey, a Palestinian American organizer with the Rochester Committee to End Apartheid said about 50 to 60 people attended the coalition’s rally.
"We are deeply saddened and frustrated about the lack of sympathy and empathy toward Palestinians," said Iman Abid, a Palestinian American organizer with Free the People Roc. Corey said Palestinians have long been dehumanized and mischaracterized by forces across the globe, and events over the last few days have heightened a grim sense of disappointment. 
"We feel like we’re screaming into a wall," Abid said.
Organizers also expressed frustration with how people in Gaza and the West Bank have been treated under occupation, citing human rights violations.
"Gaza lives under the most dismal circumstances," Corey said.
Timeline of the conflict:Why the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian fighting is among the most brutal in years
In Ormond Beach, Florida, a group of Israeli supporters gathered at the Granada Bridge, holding posters emblazoned with the Israeli flag.
"I'm coming out to show support for the Jews locally, for Israel and for America," said Raquel Levy, an attorney who organized the demonstration as a way to show support for her cousins in Israel. She said she had spoken to one, Odelia Cohen, who took shelter under a stairwell with her dog and cat as Hamas rockets landed in the area.
"They are going after civilians, dragged from their homes, just minding their own business, trying to live their life the way all of us live life. Yet, they were dragged from their homes kidnapped, killed."
Levy relayed a text message from her cousin that the pain is widespread throughout Israel.
Cohen said in her message: "I feel so stressed cause of all the uncertainly. I don't know what the future holds. Israel is a small country and everyone now knows someone who has been murdered or injured."
About 85 miles north from Levy, Palestinian supporters rallied in Jacksonville, Florida, Monday evening. Sara Mahmoud, a Palestinian American organizer for the Jacksonville Palestine Solidarity Network, noted high energy and turnout of more than 100 people for the grassroots organization’s demonstration.
"We stand with Palestine, and we stand with the Palestinian people," Mahmoud said.
The longstanding conflict is often characterized as one of religion, but Mahmoud argued it was a conflict of occupation. The organization is demanding the end of three things: U.S. aid to Israel, siege and blockade in Gaza, and Israeli settlements in the West Bank. 
"Palestinians have a right to dignity and self-determination," Mahmoud said.
The demonstrations Monday followed widespread rallies across the U.S. over the weekend, from Times Square to Los Angeles. 
A skirmish broke out Sunday between opposing demonstrators near the United Nations compound in New York City after a large group of Palestinian supporters rallied in Times Square, and others protested outside Israeli consulates in Atlanta and Chicago. 
Dozens of rallies have already taken place since this weekend, and many more are scheduled for the coming days.

The Guns N' Roses concert at Chase Field on Wednesday has been canceled so the Arizona Diamondbacks can host Game 3 of the best-of-five National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers that night.
But, Guns N' Roses are still playing.
They've just moved it down the road to the Talking Stick Resort Amphitheatre.
"Congrats to the Arizona Diamondbacks! As the playoffs land on Oct. 11, unfortunately the Chase Field show has been canceled," the band announced on Instagram Friday. "We have added a new show in its place on the same day at Talking Stick Resort Amphitheatre. We aim to accommodate as many Phoenix fans as possible."
People who had tickets to the band's show at Chase Field were eligible for a refund and given a presale code to purchase tickets at the new venue.
Many fans, however voiced their frustration with Chase Field for double-booking and the new process to go to the concert.
"Stadium’s staff didn’t believe the team would make it to the playoffs," one fan commented. Another added: "The AZ Diamondbacks executive office are at fault for this snafu— should have never happened."
One ticketholder commented, "This is a slap in the face for the people who bought txs early and have good seats.. They had to plan another day in the same stadium and grant the same Ticket."
"I now can not stand (my mom taught me to not use the word hate) the Diamondbacks organization for costing me a couple thousand to rearrange my plans to see GnR. Very conveniently they postponed then ‘canceled’ the show. Moved it to a smaller place. Gave you 24 hour window on a weekend to purchase a new ticket. But refund does not come till sometime later. Aggravating," another fan commented.

If you were a ticketholder to the originally scheduled Chase Field show, you will receive a refund from Ticketmaster. You will also receive an email for access to an exclusive presale for the newly scheduled show at Talking Stick Resort Amphitheatre.
Tickets for the new location went on sale Sunday, Oct. 8, at ticketmaster.com.

LAS VEGAS – The Green Bay Packers aren’t a talentless team.
They probably have as much or more talent than two of the three teams that have beaten them this year.
But, boy, are they a bad team.
Their offense is a mess. Their defense can be pretty good but only to a point. They are affected any time one of their starters can’t play because of injury. And they have too many players who just do what they’re told and not whatever it takes to be a difference-maker.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
After waking up with no voice, Scott Van Pelt was unavailable to host "Monday Night Countdown" for Week 5, the ESPN host posted on social media ahead of the Las Vegas Raiders hosting the Green Bay Packers.
"Unfortunately, I woke up to zero voice at all," Van Pelt wrote on X. "Just gone. As a result, no trip to Vegas for Monday Night Countdown or @SportsCenter."
Joe Buck and his wife Michelle Beisner-Buck, the "Countdown" team's features reporter for the past two seasons, jointly assume Van Pelt's hosting duties. Beisner-Buck has been with ESPN since 2014, and Buck joined her at the network last year.
The rest of the "Countdown" team includes Ryan Clark, Robert Griffin III, Marcus Spears and Larry Fitzgerald.
Van Pelt wrote he was able to power through his Sunday late-night "SportsCenter" show but that he woke up Monday with nothing left.

"Very frustrating to put everyone in this spot," Van Pelt wrote. "Hopefully back at it soon."
As part of his contract extension at ESPN, Van Pelt added "Countdown" host to his list of responsibilities. Suzy Kolber, part of the company's layoffs during the summer, was the previous host of the show.
After "Countdown," Buck went upstairs to call the Raiders-Packers game alongside Troy Aikman.
Will Ferrell knows how to throw a party!
The "Barbie" star and comedian stole the show at parents weekend at the University of Southern California during a tailgate party ahead of the school's big football game against the University of Arizona Wildcats.
Ferrell, whose eldest son Magnus is a sophomore at USC, took a page from his 2003 film "Old School" in returning to his alma mater. Instead of an attempt to relive his glory days, the actor took center stage as DJ at a Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity party.
In videos shared to social media, Ferrell had a crowd of hundreds of college students dancing to Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" and Jay-Z and Kanye West's collaboration "(Expletive) in Paris," the latter of which includes a snippet from his movie "Blades of Glory."
The "Strays" actor was all business in a backwards USC cap, sunglasses, a zip-up sweatshirt and headphones while he worked a turntable.
In addition to Ferrell's son Magnus attending USC, the actor is a 1990 graduate of the university with a bachelor's degree in sports information.
Ferrell has been back to his alma mater several times since graduation, most notably in 2017 when he delivered the commencement speech and received an honorary doctorate degree.
"It is incredibly surreal, one might even say unbelievable, that I get to deliver this address to you. As a freshman in the fall of 1986, if you were to come up to me and say that in the year 2017 you, Will Ferrell, will be delivering the commencement address for USC, I would have hugged you with tears in my eyes," he told the USC class of 2017.
The 10 best Will Ferrell movies,ranked (from 'Anchorman' to 'Barbie' and 'Strays')
Ferrell recounted all the times during his four years at USC when he subconsciously prepared for life as a comedian and trusted his intuition despite getting a degree aimed at sports broadcasting.
"To those of you graduates sitting out there who have a pretty good idea of what you’d like to do with your life, congratulations. For many of you who maybe don’t have it all figured out, it’s okay. That's the same chair that I sat in," he added. "Enjoy the process of your search without succumbing to the pressure of the result."
Ferrell ended with words of encouragement. "Trust your gut, keep throwing darts at the dartboard. Don't listen to the critics and you will figure it out," he said.

WATERTOWN TWP., Michigan − Authorities in Central Michigan on Tuesday morning entered day two of a search for a missing 3-year-old boy with special needs.
The Clinton County Sheriff's Office said the toddler, who is autistic and non-verbal, was reported missing about 2 p.m. on Monday.
The toddler was last seen walking away from his home on South Bauer Road, just north of Clark Road in north Watertown Township, a rural community about 15 miles northwest of Lansing, Michigan.

In a post on X, Michigan State Police said the boy was last seen wearing gray-and-blue shorts and a blue sweatshirt.
Authorities, who have not released the toddler's name, said the child has long, curly dark hair and did not have shoes on when he disappeared.
"The missing boy is reported to also be a climber and could be in a tree or any other elevated structure," the sheriff's office reported.
Temperatures dipped into the low 40s overnight in the area, according to the National Weather Service, and as of 7:45 a.m. ET Tuesday the temperature registered 43 degrees at the Capital Region International Airport in Lansing.

The sheriff's office reported law enforcement from several agencies, as well as numerous civilian volunteers, spent most of Monday night searching for the boy.
"Specialized units worked throughout the night and at this time, have been unable to locate the missing child," the agency wrote in a post about 7 a.m. ET.
The sheriff's office said the search for a missing boy would continue Tuesday morning after searchers failed to locate him overnight.
The sheriff's office asked residents to check their sheds, outbuildings, or areas of shelter or bodies of water.
Anyone who sees the boy is being asked to immediately call 911.
"Please keep the family in your prayers as we move forward," the sheriff's office posted on social media.

NFL power rankings entering Week 6 of the 2023 season (previous rank in parentheses):
1. 49ers (1): What else is there to say about a team that's been in the top spot since the season started? S.F.’s +99 point differential is already 20 better than the next team. Probably have the best defense (though that can be settled at Cleveland on Sunday). Might have the best offense. Stars on basically every unit. And second-year QB Brock Purdy continues to effectively play mistake-free football, his league-leading 123.1 passer rating testament to that.
2. Eagles (3): They're 5-0 in successive seasons for the first time. Next up, the Jets – a team Philadelphia has never lost to in 12 previous meetings. Feels safe to slot the reigning NFC champs at 6-0 and look ahead to their Week 7 date with Miami.
3. Lions (5): For all the focus on rookie Jahmyr Gibbs, it's veteran RB David Montgomery who's fueled a ground game with more rushes than any team in the league save two. Sunday, Montgomery became the first Detroit rusher to top 100 yards in consecutive games since … Kevin Jones in 2004.
4. Chiefs (6): Here's a stat that might surprise you – RB Isiah Pacheco leads Kansas City with 424 yards from scrimmage, nearly double TE Travis Kelce's total (222).
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
5. Bills (2): Just as LB Von Miller returns from the PUP list following last year's knee injury, LB Matt Milano (leg) could be lost for the remainder of this season. Weird as this sounds, Milano might be the more valuable player to Buffalo's defense.
6. Dolphins (7): How fast is Miami? Per Next Gen Stats, the Fins have produced the five top speeds among all plays this season and seven of the top nine. WR Tyreek Hill and RBs De'Von Achane and Raheem Mostert are responsible for them (and WR Jaylen Waddle has also cracked the top 20). Big-play Achane is averaging a ridiculous 12.1 yards per carry and 115.0 rushing yards per game, both figures best in the NFL. But seems likely a knee injury will force veteran Jeff Wilson to spot Achane in the coming weeks.
7. Jaguars (14): The first team to play multiple international games in a season is now the first to win multiple – both coming against teams with winning records. Stay in Europe, Jags – it seems inevitable, and you're apparently better for it.
8. Cowboys (4): Good thing they're not part of the NFC West … even if it would make more sense geographically. In its two defeats (to Arizona and San Francisco), Dallas has lost by a collective 70-26. Worse, the Niners seemed to expose how limited the Mike McCarthy offense might actually be.
9. Steelers (12): They've gained the third-fewest yards in the league and surrendered the third most, the delta more than 600 yards. But 11 takeaways, 17 sacks and just enough clutch plays from QB Kenny Pickett can mask such warts … and propel you to the top of the AFC North.
10. Ravens (8): It's been an uneven start, to say the least, but it's also unusual to play four of five away from home so early in the season – and Baltimore's three-game roadie winds to a conclusion Sunday in London.
11. Rams (9): Sure, they're 2-3, but they've hung tough against the league's top teams, San Francisco and Philadelphia. Appears WRs Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua will complement each other nicely, each getting at least 11 targets Sunday, Kupp's 2023 debut.
12. Seahawks (10): Coming off their bye, they're currently not scheduled to face a team with a winning record until November. Time to make serious hay toward a playoff berth.
13. Browns (13): Semi-eventful bye week with GM Andrew Berry explaining QB Deshaun Watson's last-minute scratch in Cleveland's previous game while defending the trade of obviously capable veteran QB2 Josh Dobbs during preseason.
14. Buccaneers (16): This marks three times in four years that QB Baker Mayfield has won three of his first four starts. His only 4-1 beginning led to a deep playoff run in Cleveland.
15. Saints (20): Great sidebar to Sunday's 34-0 runaway in New England. TE Foster Moreau, a New Orleans native, scored his first TD with the Saints – and first since beating Hodgkin lymphoma during the offseason. Pretty cool story amid the NFL's annual "Crucial Catch" campaign for cancer screening.
16. Falcons (18): If you know anything about the NFL, and running backs in particular, best to appreciate their genius while you can. Thankfully, Bijan Robinson has been putting his on display week in and week out, Sunday's TD catch-and-run a thing of beauty.
17. Colts (17): QB2 Gardner Minshew II may be the league's best reliever, but Indianapolis surely didn't count on him playing 50% of the snaps to this point – a figure that's going to rise as Anthony Richardson's sprained throwing shoulder heals.
18. Texans (11): No matter Sunday's outcome, this will be their best six-game start since 2019. But it would help if Houston would run the ball better after cracking 90 yards just once so far this season.
19. Titans (21): WR DeAndre Hopkins' 100-yard day courtesy of Ryan Tannehill was the 11th time he's topped the century mark with a different quarterback. Get a C-note with two more passers, and Nuk sets a league record … so might be worthy lobbying for playing time for Malik Willis and rookie Will Levis.
20. Chargers (22): Did you know WR Keenan Allen owns the NFL record for most games – three – with at least 15 receptions? With wingman Mike Williams down for the count, wouldn't be a shock if Allen extends that mark before this year is out.
21. Jets (24): Only 12 games into his career, he hardly has enough totes to qualify – but if he did, Breece Hall's 6.3 yards per carry would be a record among RBs. Unfortunately, could be hard to sustain that with OL Alijah Vera-Tucker (Achilles) headed to injured reserve.
22. Bengals (26): They'll only be on the road two more times before December, so maybe the comforts of home are good for QB Joe Burrow's calf and team focus with a brutal upcoming schedule (Seattle, San Francisco, Buffalo) for a Cincinnati club that may finally otherwise be turning the corner.
23. Raiders (28): If they're going to salvage their season and use Monday's win as a catapult, now is the time. The Silver and Black face three one-win teams (Patriots, Bears, Giants) over the next four weeks.
24. Packers (19): No worse way to go into a bye week than off a terrible loss. But Green Bay's next three opponents (Broncos, Vikings, Rams) have a combined four wins, so hopefully a good time for the Pack to get healthy figuratively and literally.
25. Vikings (25): Why is offensive balance often a virtue? Consider one-win Minnesota, which has thrown more passes (204) than any team in the league while attempting the fewest runs (91). However that calculus might have to change with All-Pro Justin Jefferson's hamstring injury forcing him to IR.
26. Bears (32): The Justin Fields-to-DJ Moore Show has sparked Chicago's revival. But look closer, and you'll also note a running game averaging better than 170 yards the past two weeks and some encouraging signs of life on defense at Washington. The schedule also suggests Da Bears could easily be a .500 team from here on out.
27. Commanders (15): Only Denver has surrendered more points than Washington's 160. Only Minnesota has turned it over more times than Washington's 10. Lethal combo.
28. Broncos (29): Naturally, when you crown yourselves with dopey "snowcapped" helmets, another Rocky Mountain meltdown is completely inevitable.
29. Giants (30): S Jason Pinnock's 102-yard pick-six Sunday is the longest play of the season NFL-wide and provided Big Blue's first TD before halftime this season. Some consolation for a team that hasn't run an offensive play with the lead yet and has now been outscored by a league-most 91 points.
30. Cardinals (27): No NFC team is blitzing less frequently – worth wondering if that's the right approach given the way Arizona's D has been torn up the past two weeks.
31. Patriots (23): If the dynasty wasn't already dead, then life support has officially been unplugged. Bill Belichick wants to "start over" after suffering the two worst defeats of his career with an offense that's been shut out of the end zone for 10 consecutive quarters and has turned it over 10 times.
32. Panthers (31): The NFL's only winless team just turned it in its worst defensive performance (42 points allowed) of the season. Its reward? A trip to Miami. Woof.

Brooke Burke revealed that being partnered with Derek Hough on "Dancing with the Stars" 15 years ago started off rocky but ended with a lasting crush on the pro dancer.
"I was crushing on Derek, for sure," she told fellow "DWTS" alum Cheryl Burke in Sunday's episode of Cheryl's podcast, "Sex, Lies and Spray Tans." (And no, the Burkes are not related.) Brooke, the celebrity dancer, was paired with a then-23-year-old Hough in Season 7 of the show in 2008.
"If I had not been married, I would've actually hoped we would've had a love affair," Brooke said.
At the time, she was dating actor David Charvet. The couple married in 2011, and she filed for divorce in 2018.
Brooke explained, "You are intertwined with someone's body; when you are not a dancer, there is no way I have ever been so connected besides with a lover or a husband than I was with Derek, and it's every single day."
"For three months, you are in someone's arms. Why do you think people fall in love? You smell them. You feel them. You're breathing with them," she said. "It can be more intimate than making love in the bedroom. You're, like, making love on the dancefloor when you're really connected."
Cheryl was shocked by Brooke's admission and insisted that Hough would "freak out ... in a good way."
"He kept telling me how hot you were on your season," Cheryl said.
What just happened?:Jamie Lynn Spears eliminated in shocking 'Dancing With the Stars' Week 2.
Brooke concluded that competing with Hough on "DWTS" was "life-changing," and added, "I will always have a crush on Derek."
She is currently engaged to fiancé Scott Rigsby, who works in real estate, while Hough and fellow former "DWTS" pro dancer Hayley Erbert were married in August.
"Dancing With the Stars"Dives into Scandoval with Ariana Madix: "Scandal does not define me"
On the podcast, Brooke opened up about the journey that led to her and Hough winning Season 7 of "Dancing with the Stars."
The fitness guru and TV personality, who went on to co-host several seasons of the competition show, confessed that, at first, she and Hough "just weren't connected."
"We weren't jelling. We were having issues off-camera and in rehearsals," she said.
But after consulting with a life coach, "something magical happened and we found faith in each other — at least I did — and we just decided to win." Though Hough was "brutally honest," "it made me better," Burke said.
After putting in nine years as a pro dancer on "DWTS," Hough joined the judges' panel in 2020. Brooke Burke co-hosted the show from season 10-17 before announcing she wouldn't be returning right before Season 18 premiered.

The Atlanta Braves managed to pull themselves out of a potentially devastating 2-0 hole on Monday night.
Despite not recording a hit until the sixth inning when the team faced a 4-0 deficit, Atlanta defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 2 of the National League Division Series, 5-4. It was enough to draw the series score even as the two teams head north to Philadelphia.
Phillies pitcher Zack Wheeler was dominant, allowing just one hit and one (unearned) run through six innings before conceding a two-run home run to former Mets teammate Travis d'Arnaud in the seventh. The Braves eventually managed to take the lead with two outs in the eighth inning when third baseman Austin Riley hit a two-run blast on a full count off of Jeff Hoffman, Philadelphia's third pitcher of the night.
Then, in the top of the ninth inning, with Bryce Harper standing on first base with one out, right fielder Nick Castellanos drilled a ball toward the gap in right-center field. What happened next was one of the most stunning plays in recent postseason memory.

Editor's note: Part one of a five-part USA TODAY series revealing why America hasn't solved its long struggle with Type 2 diabetes.
For chef Robin Ray, newly married with young stepchildren, the turning point came when a stabbing chest pain sent her rushing to the emergency room. 
For Brian Castrucci, the gravity hit when the ER doc who had treated him for a near-heart attack a few weeks earlier gave him a big bear hug. “I didn’t think you’d make it,” the doctor said.
The crisis unspooled more slowly for James Haynes but started in 2019 when he stepped on a rusty nail and didn’t notice. 
The moments were turning points for all three to get serious about addressing their diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can’t properly regulate blood sugar, has become so common it’s almost considered inconsequential. More than 1 in 10 Americans have the disease (though many don't know) and another nearly 4 in 10 are at risk for it. In total, half of all adults and a quarter of teenagers have diabetes or pre-diabetes.
Its financial costs are astronomical. The country spends more than $300 billion a year to address diabetes, accounting for $1 out of every $4 spent on health care. 
And its personal tolls are even worse: heart attacks, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, double the risk of premature death. It also causes what’s known as “diabetes distress,” the daily burdens and emotional toll of living with and managing a chronic ailment that can lead to regular dips in energy, foggy thinking and depression, and a sense of isolation.
The most frustrating aspect of Type 2 diabetes, experts say, is that it has long been largely preventable and controllable. 
“We have made tremendous gains in understanding diabetes,” said Dr. Donald Berwick, a pediatrician and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “The best diabetes care can make a very big difference. You can’t say we don’t know what to do.”
And yet, diagnosed rates of Type 2 diabetes have soared over the past 25 years, and especially over the past dozen – particularly among working-age adults like Ray, Castrucci and Haynes. 
Roughly 40% of people who died early in the coronavirus pandemic had Type 2 diabetes, a rate four times higher than people without the disease. Even when elevated blood sugar levels are below the threshold for type 2 diabetes, the risk for heart disease jumps 30% to 50% compared with people with normal blood sugar levels. (Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 5% to 10% of diabetes, is caused by the immune system and is unrelated to diet or lifestyle.)
America’s failure to address Type 2 diabetes highlights larger problems with our food and medical systems, Berwick and other experts said.
A soda costs less than a bottle of water, a double cheeseburger and fries less than a carton of blueberries. Patients wait months for medical appointments only to see the back of a white coat for the short time they’re allotted. Treating disease costs society far more than preventing it but typically provides more profit for insurance companies, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry.
The USA TODAY Health team spoke with scores of health care providers, researchers, community leaders and patients for this five-part series to understand why Type 2 diabetes continues to worsen in America despite known solutions.
The answer isn't simple. It involves systemic problems facing everyone in society, not just those with diabetes: a food system designed to sell products; a medical system in which cutting off a leg is less expensive than saving it; the high cost of healthy living and the fact that breaking habits takes a lot more than just personal willpower.
This first story looks at what it takes for people to cope with or overcome the disease.
Then, we explore one community in a David vs. Goliath battle against a food system that fails to prioritize people's health.
More in series:Diabetes runs deep in rural Mississippi. Locals have taken to growing their own solutions.
We next travel to Colorado, which has the lowest level of diabetes in the nation. Yet even in this state, where hiking trails and gorgeous views abound, economic and other disparities make it easier for some people to avoid diabetes than others.

Finally, we explore solutions, addressing why it will take a combination of education, medication, medical devices and improved food access to solve this national problem.

The system is fixable, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.
But it will take "sensible action" from across many sectors, including health care, science, nutrition, business, public health and politics to change the financial and other incentives that drive so many Americans toward sickness instead of health.
"If we do it all, we could fix a lot of this in 10 years," said Mozaffarian, who serves on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. "If we do it incrementally or don't do it at all, we're all going to be toast in 50 years from diet-related illnesses and a depleted environment."
There’s no question personal responsibility plays a role in fighting diabetes. 
Haynes, Ray and Castrucci radically changed their lifestyles and sought help after their come-to-Jesus experiences. They’ve reduced their dependence on daily medication and hope to have saved themselves the horrors of more amputations, blindness and dialysis. They’ve extended their lives and improved the quality of that time.
But like many medical problems, the challenges of diabetes go well beyond individual responsibility and blame. 
“There are structural issues that we have to start paying attention to and addressing,” said Dr. Shivani Agarwal, an endocrinologist who specializes in research and treating young adults with diabetes at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Agarwal recently led a series of studies in the journal The Lancet that looked at diabetes rates around the world. 
Poverty, the studies showed, was a major driver of diabetes, along with racism and unequal access to healthy food and high-quality medical care.
Personal stories illustrate how these structural issues play out in the lives of so many Americans.
Ray, 45, director of culinary operations at HOSCO/North Sarah Food Hub in St. Louis, got weight-loss surgery and then put her culinary expertise to good use.  
Castrucci, 49, who runs a public health nonprofit outside Washington, D.C., used his advantages provided by his work, salary and insurance to “buy” himself better health.
 “I’m healthy because of privilege – not diet, not exercise, not determination,” he said.
Haynes, 58, a former truck driver and maintenance technician in Gulfport, Mississippi, has fewer material assets, but his attitude and the advantages he does have explain why he's still around, despite all he has been through.
“It’s going to be all right after a while, as long as I keep this spirit,” he said.
Ray’s love for food began when she was 8 years old, watching Julia Child on TV. During family gatherings, she would run around taking everyone’s dinner order. Then she’d scurry back to the kitchen with a notepad full of scribbles. 
Throughout her life, she made fried chicken, pork chops, baked mac and cheese, collard greens, and even a whole roasted chicken filled with wild rice and two sticks of butter – everything that made her soul sing. 
In her world, food was home. Food was family. Food was love. 
But that was some pretty tough love. 
In 2002, Ray was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Her father, grandmother, aunts and uncles all had diabetes. She knew what it meant.
“For you to tell me I can’t have ice blue raspberry Kool-Aid was like you shut down my world,” Ray said. “I didn’t want to accept it. So, I ate, because you eat through your emotions.” 
She didn't dwell on the diagnosis and continued with life. Her culinary career took her to Italy, where she learned and fell even more in love with food. She returned to St. Louis, got married and became a mom to her husband’s two children ‒ “beautiful bonus babies,” as she described them. Through the years, she continued to express love through cooking and eating. 
In 2015, a stabbing chest pain sent her to the emergency room. Doctors assured Ray she hadn’t had a heart attack, but they warned that her life was on the line. At 5-foot-2, she weighed 334 pounds and had an A1C, a measure of average blood sugar of 11%, well above the 6.5% cutoff to be considered diabetic. Her diabetes – and her diet – were out of control. 
“That scared me. … It was gut-wrenching and terrifying,” she said. “I’m fighting against something that’s fighting me back and I did not know how to win.” 
She and her primary care doctor decided she would pursue weight loss surgery. 
But she also decided to use her culinary prowess to transform her diet. She reconfigured favorite foods, substituting healthier ingredients: Collard greens cooked in smoked fats or ham hocks turned into a kale, turnip and rutabaga recipe flavored with natural chicken broth fat, oils and seasonings. 
She fostered her feelings into new recipes and brought them to North Sarah Food Hub, which partnered with Barnes-Jewish Hospital to make packaged, pre-made meals for St. Louis residents with diabetes and limited access to fresh food.
“I had to restructure the food that I put in my mouth. I had to think about what I was eating and how I was eating and how it was going to be good for my body,” she said. “I became excited about food again, and food became a joy.” 
It isn’t always easy, of course. Ray admits to an occasional cookie craving. But now she takes the time to think about how her body processes that cookie and whether it’s worthwhile. 
She hopes her cooking can help other people make the same transformation she did. Her staff at North Sarah helps her create new recipes for others. She wants to provide nourishment that allows people to avoid illness and medicine. 
“Nobody wants to take 55 pills, nobody wants to feel like a patient, but how do you fix that? It’s by our food,” she said. “That should be what we’re teaching our community and our culture and our children. … It’s not always about the macaroni noodle with a smile, it’s about what’s good for your body.” 
Castrucci is a third-generation diabetes patient. The lifetime risk of developing Type 2 diabetes if a parent has it is 40%. If both parents have it, the risk jumps to 70%.
He knew he was at risk, but he pushed his luck, he said, by eating poorly during the pandemic and falling out of his exercise routine. With the luxury of working from home, walking to the kitchen and bathroom was often the extent of his daily activity.
On Feb. 14, 2022 – Valentine’s Day – he went to an urgent care clinic, concerned his breathing trouble meant he had bronchitis. His blood pressure measured 210 over 110, well above normal levels that top out at 120 over 80. A chest X-ray showed fluid filling his lungs, leading to congestive heart failure. 
The clinic sent him straight to a local emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a blockage of the left descending artery – a clogged artery made worse by diabetes. If he had waited any longer, he would have had a massive heart attack, his doctor later told him.
After his release from the hospital, he went to the drugstore to fill his new prescriptions. The pharmacist told him she couldn’t fill one because it would cost $1,000. He’d have to wait until his insurance approved it. “Please fill it,” he said. She stressed the cost. “Fill it,” he pleaded, putting the charge on his credit card.
Medication helped him lose 70 pounds in three months. When his local drugstore ran out of the weight-loss drug, he easily drove to another pharmacy and then another to find what he needed. 
His 100 hours of high-quality cardiac rehabilitation were fully covered by insurance.  
"For my midlife crisis, I got healthy," Castrucci said.
He could devote all his energy to getting well because he didn’t have to focus on how to afford his care. “(I) paid almost nothing for the whole episode,” he said, “and never worried about it because I have really good insurance.” 
Even so, Castrucci pays out-of-pocket for a cardiologist and an endocrinologist because the best ones near him don’t accept insurance.
Every time he goes to Walgreens to refill his medications, Castrucci said, he sees someone turned away because they can’t afford their prescriptions. When they finally show up in the emergency room, “because they will,” they will cost the system far more, he said.
“Health outcomes are dictated by economics. It’s a whole side of privilege that we don’t always talk about.”
On the day Haynes stepped on a rusty nail in 2019, he walked all day as the nail pierced the sole of his sneaker and then his foot. By the time he took off his shoe that night, his foot was infected. He landed in the hospital for two months as doctors and nurses tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to get the infection and Haynes’ blood sugar under control.
By the time he was released, he knew enough about Type 2 diabetes to realize his daily blood sugar levels – typically in the mid-400s – were four times above what he had been told to shoot for.
But nothing he did or ate seemed to make a difference. He had long since traded ribs for salads, beer for water. 
His wife, Angela, barely noticed when James started wearing multiple pairs of socks, pouring powder on his feet and buying bigger shoes. His feet tingled a lot, he said, but he was coping with it. 
James ended up in the emergency room again, dehydrated and in need of antibiotics. The doctor amputated the baby toe on his right foot, leaving a large open wound. 
"We're going to leave this open because we'll probably have to take more,” Angela remembered the doctor saying. “I didn't like that we're not going to try to save anything, we're just going to start cutting.”
James was fading.
His arm muscles shriveled and he lost his Popeye physique. Antibiotics left him looking sickly, his voice so weak Angela could barely hear him. “I felt like I was watching my husband slowly dying,” she said.
Finally, taking her doctor sister’s advice, Angela emailed Dr. Foluso Fakorede’s office to ask for an appointment. She thought it would take months to get James in to see the heart disease specialist, but the office called and asked if they could come the next day. 
The Hayneses would end up going back to see Fakorede many times − sometimes twice in one week, driving more than five hours each way from Gulfport north to Cleveland, Mississippi.
“We started looking forward to these visits because there was always hope,” Angela Haynes said, though she felt guilty they were taking up so much of the important doctor’s time. 
Fakorede, who is on a personal mission to save people with diabetes from amputations, noticed what other doctors had missed. Haynes had blockages in blood vessels on both legs. 
Once he got the blood flowing again, Haynes began to feel better. His flesh returned to its normal color. The wound started healing at last. Walking became easier.
Then disaster struck again. 
On July 2, 2022, Haynes caught COVID-19. "Everything went downhill after that," he said.
During his 13-day illness, the bacteria in his foot raged out of control. He ended up back in the hospital and unable to withstand the long drive to Fakorede’s office.
Every week, a surgeon would come to the door of his hospital room and before even stepping all the way in ask Haynes whether he had decided to get his leg amputated. 
"This is my leg. I was born with this. And you're walking in like you're cutting a piece of cake," Haynes said.
He was worried about how he’d get around, how he’d be able to work to support his family if he had only one leg. No one took the time to explain why they thought the leg needed to come off or how he’d cope without it, Haynes said. 
In late November, he was finally sent home in a wheelchair. But just three weeks later, as he was getting out of the car after wound care, his right leg gave out and he fell to the ground. Back at the hospital, Haynes was told his foot was broken, essentially beyond repair. He agreed to a below-the-knee amputation.
Released right before Christmas, he spent the next three weeks in bed wondering how he’d manage the rest of his life.
Finally, it looked as if his luck might be turning around.
With the leg gone, his diabetes improved. His blood sugar dropped into the 120s or one-teens. His blurry vision cleared up.
During his long hospital stay, he befriended nurses and learned about a program for people who needed prostheses. The man who ran it called early in the year and said he had received a donated leg. If it fit Haynes, he could have it while waiting for insurance to pay for a personalized one. Miraculously, it did. 
Haynes spent the next six months teaching himself to walk again. The donor leg was heavy and uncomfortable. He wasn't mobile enough to hold down a job.
One late spring night, picking up dinner at a nearby restaurant, he headed to the bathroom for a pit stop. A sink had been leaking all day and Haynes slipped in the puddle, falling backward.
He's still recovering from the resulting wrist surgery.
He and Angela are living – barely – off her part-time salary as a secretary and a church organist.
Haynes has tried "at least three or four times" to receive government assistance, but they keep losing his paperwork, or not believing he's disabled, though he once checked himself out of the hospital and arrived at an appointment in his wheelchair to prove he didn't have a leg.
Still, he clings to his faith and the positive attitude he has long used to cheer up himself and others. These are his secret weapons against diabetes and everything else life throws his way.
"I try to put a smile on other people's faces," he said. "It keeps my day going."

The USA TODAY Best-selling Booklist is back!
After a brief hiatus, USA TODAY’s beloved bestsellers list has returned with the features and characteristics that have long made it the People’s Booklist.
Our goal remains the same: Provide book lovers with the best, most accurate snapshot of what people are reading by showing which titles are selling. It is a master list, unbound by genre and format, of what’s selling broadly across the U.S.
“I am so thrilled that the USA Today Best-selling Booklist is coming back!" says bestselling author Colleen Hoover in a statement. "It gives so many authors the wonderful opportunity to be recognized as bestsellers and for readers to discover their next favorite book.”
Hoover, the self-published writer turned bestselling powerhouse who's authored dozens of novels including "It Ends With Us" and "Verity," was the undisputed queen of the Booklist in 2022 and spent weeks atop the list. Her novel "It Starts With Us" claimed the No. 1 spot in its first week, her highest debut ever, selling more than 800,000 copies on its first day of sales. It was her fourth book to hit No. 1 in 2022.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
The USA TODAY list is a ranking of the top-selling titles each week from a broad range of businesses including major chains, independent bookstores and online retailers. It reflects combined sales of titles in print and electronic format, if available. Our data team weighs and compiles those numbers to generate the week's 150 top-selling titles. The rankings reflect sales from the previous Monday through Sunday. The full list will publish online at 6 a.m. Wednesdays, with the top 50 titles publishing in print Thursdays.
The list, which began in 1993, went on hiatus in December. It is the longest-running USA TODAY data journalism project.
In our continued commitment to bring readers more books coverage, USA TODAY is also excited to announce a new content partnership with The Novel Neighbor, an independently owned and operated bookstore in St. Louis. They are expert booksellers and passionate readers who are deeply connected to what their community is reading. With the partnership will come regular profiles of independent bookstores across the country, highlighting the important role of these businesses in their local communities. Novel Neighbor will also be sharing expert book recommendations and fun takes on book trends.
We can't wait to see what you've been reading!
ANCHORAGE, Alaska ― The infamous Sinaloa Cartel, once headed by notorious kingpin "El Chapo," and others in Mexico are targeting Alaska with drug pipelines, driving up the overdose death toll.
It's difficult to reach much of the remote state, so there are fewer criminal networks competing for customers, but that means drug traffickers can triple or quadruple their price and net much larger profits.
"All the drug dealers are aware they can make more money selling drugs in Alaska," said James Klugman, head of federal criminal prosecutions for Alaska's U.S. Attorney's Office.
Deadly fentanyl and other illegal narcotics continue saturating the urban centers of Anchorage, as well as Juneau to the east and Fairbanks to the north. From those main hubs, shipments are dispersed far and wide, stretching from tiny islands off the southern coast all the way up to the Arctic region, according to state and federal police.
To the west, drugs have pummeled small villages in Bethel and Nome, known as the final stop on the historic Iditarod dog sled race.
"An amount of drugs that wouldn't even move the needle in big cities like Los Angeles or New York can completely change the life of an entire community in Alaska," Klugman said.
Drugs have spread to every corner of the state, even to villages of 50 people or less, said Brandon Waddle, assistant special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's field office in Anchorage.
"What keeps me up at night is the fact that fentanyl is killing our small, most vulnerable communities," he said. "The opioid crisis is attacking us, and we don't have enough personnel to effectively combat it."
Alaska suffered the nation's largest percent increase in overdose deaths in 2021, with a 75% spike from the previous year, adding to the nation's estimated death toll of nearly 107,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC reported Alaska's overdose death rate jumped in one year from 20.2 to 35.6 per 100,000 residents.
About 76% of the 253 fatal overdoses in Alaska in 2021 involved synthetic narcotics, including fentanyl, according to a report by the Governor's Advisory Council on Opioid Remediation.
The Louisville Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, reviewed several drug cases and spent nearly two weeks in parts of Alaska, talking with grieving parents, residents in addiction recovery, Alaska Native advocates, health officials, defense attorneys, as well as local, state and federal law enforcement.
Fishermen, hikers, hunters and cruise ship enthusiasts are drawn to the snow dusted mountains, the blue tinted glaciers, fjords, glassy glacier lakes and salmon-rich waters in the nation's largest state. But its vastness and landscape make it hard to patrol.
"The opioid crisis has hit hard, and it's hit close to me," said Cornelius Sims, a lieutenant with the Alaska State Troopers and supervisor of a statewide drug task force. "I have had family members become addicted. I have lost close friends.
"I've seen very vibrant, positive, outgoing individuals from good upbringings go from that to living on the streets homeless, doing whatever they can to survive."
During the past few years, fentanyl began to permeate Alaska, and many customers started seeking it out, Waddle said. In Alaska, and across the nation, it's now most commonly peddled in fake prescription pills that mimic the appearance of legitimate medication for pain or other conditions.
Alaska has about 734,000 residents spread out over a land mass that's two and a half times the size of Texas and larger than America's next three largest states ― Texas, California and Montana ― combined.
And there are hundreds of small villages only accessible by small planes. For many, snowmobiles replace cars during the winter. The further drug dealers have to travel, the more they charge.
Traffickers have taken the extra steps needed to get their product to the tiny, out-of-the-way town of Whittier, 60 miles southeast of Anchorage and near the popular Portage Glacier. Most of Whittier's 270 residents live across from the harbor under one roof, in a 14-story pastel-colored building, also home to the police department, library, church, convenience store and post office. It previously served as an Army barracks.
It takes about 80 minutes to drive there from Anchorage on Seward Highway, as long as a moose doesn't wander into the road and stop traffic. But drivers have to plan their visit, paying a $13 toll to access the tunnel leading into town and waiting until half past each hour for a turn using the one-lane tunnel. You can leave the city only at the top of each hour, because tunnel traffic alternates directions and is shared by cars and a passenger train.
The extra effort exemplifies the determination of greedy drug dealers.
A Mexican trafficker established a drug network several years ago in Girdwood, a small town between Whittier and Anchorage that's known for its posh ski resort and tram. Jorge Cardenas and his crew blanketed the area with meth and introduced customers to fentanyl. Since drug trends in Alaska tend to lag behind the Lower 48, or contiguous U.S., by a few years, police say this was one of the first cases of its kind in Alaska.
Cardenas admitted creating what he called "gunpowder heroin" by lacing heroin with fentanyl, now the top drug killing Americans. He took advantage of customers who didn't realize the dangers of fentanyl, and his network expanded to Juneau and Anchorage. While searching his family's home, agents found a shrine to Jesús Malverde, known as the "Patron Saint of Drug Dealers" or the "narco saint."
In Alaska, most drug shipments first arrive in the major hub of Anchorage, the state's largest city with more than 287,000 residents, nearly 40% of the Alaska's population.
One major drug pipeline sent heroin, meth and cocaine from Mexico into Arizona and then onward to Anchorage.
In a recent case still in court, alleged kingpin Miguel Baez Guevara is charged with targeting Alaska with a pipeline for years while hiding out in Sonora, a northwest Mexican state bordered by Arizona. Federal agents were looking for Guevara, who maintains his innocence and is awaiting trial, on a separate 2014 drug case out of Arizona when he fled across the border.

He is charged with heading the drug ring to Alaska without ever stepping foot in the state.
Mexican immigration officials found and arrested Guevara, a U.S. citizen, in 2021 and deported him to America.
"Guevara made it known he was associated with the Sinaloa Cartel and there were serious and violent repercussions for couriers who stole narcotics or provided information to law enforcement," according to a 2021 news release by federal prosecutors in Alaska.
The drug ring used Facebook, WhatsApp and other messaging apps to recruit Alaska residents, mainly women, to work as couriers — reasoning they wouldn't look as suspicious as men from another country. The couriers were paid in cash or in drugs to fly to Mexico to pick up shipments and take them back to their home state.
On the plane, the women traveled in small groups and took orders from a group leader.
One group leader, Jarese Joell Martinez, a U.S. citizen who lived in Mexico, scrawled copious notes in a book, detailing the rules her subordinates had to follow. She told them how to dress, not to drink alcohol and to stay by her side, so they didn't draw attention, according to a transcript of her 2018 sentencing hearing that sent her off to prison for 10 years.
"She was helping command other people and bringing more people into the scheme," prosecutors told the judge during Martinez's sentencing, according to the transcript, comparing the drug ring's business model to a pyramid scheme.
"Higher up-level people rely on addicts and then those addicts rely on getting other people hooked on narcotics."
Once the couriers arrived with the shipments, a drug ring supervisor stationed in Alaska met them to pay them and collect the narcotics. Drug dealers in Alaska would then contact Guevara, who coordinated the drug deals from Mexico, prosecutors allege.
Traffickers use the interstate highway system to cart drugs north of Anchorage to many small communities, including Wasilla and Palmer, which served as home to the state fair in August. South of Anchorage, drugs have been driven to Girdwood, Seward, Kenai, Soldotna and Homer.
The majority of the fentanyl smuggled into Alaska is coming from Mexican cartels, according to the FBI.
"They're transported across the southern border from Mexico to major urban centers on the West Coast — Los Angeles, Seattle, Phoenix and Las Vegas," Waddle said.
From those cities, some drugs are mailed in packages sent to Alaska. Others are loaded onto cargo ships alongside produce and other goods. And many shipments are smuggled by couriers, who hide drugs on their bodies or in backpacks, purses or suitcases.
After drugs arrive in Anchorage, some shipments are driven to towns and others are smuggled on ferries and small planes bound for remote areas. Agents say they worry if they don't intercept shipments in Anchorage, there's less of a chance the drugs will be detected as they spread out across the state.
Alaska's land mass is so vast, it could stretch from Montana to Florida, but it doesn't have counties or sheriffs and only some areas have local police. That means state troopers are the primary law enforcement presence for much of the state and may end up patrolling an area the size of Rhode Island alone, giving an edge to cartel associates wanting to avoid detection.
"We're seeing addiction in villages with less than 500 people in them and as far up as Barrow," said Sims, head of the statewide drug enforcement unit.
Some drug shipments sent to Fairbanks, used by cartels as the northern hub, continued on to Barrow, now officially named "Utqiaġvik," which is the northern tip of Alaska on the Arctic Ocean. The small town hosts an annual festival of the Inupiaq Eskimos and is lauded as one of the top places to view the swirling emerald streaks of the aurora borealis or Northern Lights.
"Opioids can do catastrophic damage in those communities," Waddle said. "In those communities, people work together to survive," especially during harsh winters.
If five or six residents become addicted to drugs and aren't able to help hunt, fish and provide for the community, it creates a disparate impact, the FBI agent said.
Alaska's capital, Juneau, is accessible only by plane or boat, and has become the drug hub for the state's southeast region.
Each day, throngs of tourists load onto enormous cruise ships, on planes and ferries to visit glaciers, fjords, national parks, mountains and lakes — while drug traffickers also exploit these transportation methods to drop off their products.
Once drugs arrive in Juneau, some go to local customers. Other shipments are destined for one of the many coastal islands and must be sent on small plane, passenger ferry, cargo ship or boat.
Juneau Police Lt. Krag Campbell said his department noticed an increase in fentanyl beginning about two years ago.
"Now, we're starting to see large quantities. We’ve seen an increase in overdose deaths killing community members."
Investigators have had some seizures of as much as 20,000 pills laced with fentanyl, he said. Nationwide, about 42% of pills tested for fentanyl contain a potentially lethal dose, according to data from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
Investigators say drugs have reached the Aleutian Islands, which are sprinkled south of mainland Russia and mainland Alaska and mark a dividing line between the Bering Sea and the Pacific Ocean.
Fentanyl and other opioids also are ravaging small towns known for fishing and tourism, including Sitka on Baronof Island and Prince of Wales Island, home to Northern flying squirrels and part of the Tongass National Forest.
In an unusual case, a beach visitor found a large container of about a kilo of cocaine in December 2020 that washed up on Cannon Beach, between Anchorage and Juneau. The sandy beach, north of the mouth of Lost River, in Yakutat, is known for its surfing, said Campbell, who heads the Southeast Alaska Communities Against Drugs task force of local, state and federal investigators.
In the same month, a second package with another kilo of cocaine washed up on a Sitka beach, a 40-minute plane ride south of Juneau that serves as a popular tourist stop.
"We're not sure if it came in on a boat that capsized or did a plane bring it and drop it and something happened?" said Campbell, who said he isn't sure of the shipment's intended destination.
It's also possible drug traffickers on a boat became worried about being detected by the U.S. Coast Guard or other investigators and dumped it on purpose, he said.
Investigators are also concerned about drugs hidden on small planes. In Alaska, about one in every 80 residents is a pilot, Klugman said. Driving around Anchorage, you can spot planes parked in backyards.
Drugs can be smuggled on these small airplanes, with or without the pilot's knowledge.
There typically isn't any screening of the cargo or passengers, because smaller airports don't have TSA checkpoints and police on standby.
Sims, the Alaska state trooper, said anytime he boards a plane, he automatically watches other passengers, wondering what they might be bringing into his home state.
Standing by a bustling boat dock in Sitka on a recent sunny day, local resident Denise Damewood discussed her mission to save lives through "Project Gabe," by increasing access to naloxone, a fast-acting opioid antidote.
It's part of her job as a nurse at the Sitka Public Health Center, but it's also personal. Her 30-year-old stepson, Gabe Johnston, who once worked in Alaska's seafood processing industry, died last year from a fentanyl overdose.
"Whether you live in Sitka, Alaska — population 8,000 — or New York, opioids will find a way there," she said.
Damewood installed a red box containing naloxone and printed instructions on a post at the dock, which can be used by fishermen in an emergency. She also has convinced some boat captains to carry waterproof kits on boats.
"Gabe loved water, to fish and to hunt," said his father, Gary Johnston. "He was a good kid, just made some poor choices."
Johnston said he has seen his son's texts soon before his death, including ones where Gabe asked for reassurance from the drug dealer that the pills he bought weren't laced with fentanyl. The dealer, who may or may not have known the truth, claimed they were safe.
The rescue kits include fentanyl testing strips, which can be used by those struggling with addiction to screen for fentanyl, as well as educational materials.
Damewood has led the effort to get 2,000 kits to residents throughout the state and some to Washington and Canada. And she's not slowing down.
"We went from the fishing industry to hotel industries to the ferry system to cruise ships and (gold) mines," she said.
She's convinced several employers, some of whom hire up to 500 seasonal employees at a time, to discuss the kits during orientation.
Residents can even get a naloxone, or Narcan, kit at the Sitka Public Library.
Jessica Ieremia, the library director, said her brother battled addiction. He ultimately died of cancer, but his wife overdosed and died in Washington in February on the day of the funeral.
Ieremia rushed to the victim, found on the bathroom floor, but was unable to resuscitate her.
"I kept thinking, 'If I had a Narcan kit, I could have saved her,'" the library director said.
The Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium, known as SEARHC, has opened opioid addiction treatment centers in Sitka and downtown Juneau, offering medication-assisted treatment and behavior therapy.
Dr. Corey Cox, a Kentucky native who went to medical school in Louisville, oversees the treatment programs and said a third center will open within weeks on the more isolated Prince of Wales Island.
"The people most impacted by addiction could live in a village," Cox said. "That's been the biggest barrier for our patients.
"We're trying to figure out how to bring these services to every little area."
GETTING HELP:
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration offers a free and confidential 24-hour national hotline 800-662-4357 providing information on treatment options.
Naloxone kits, also known by the name brand Narcan, are available at many pharmacies and through most states' health departments. In Alaska, you can learn how to get the life-saving kits by sending an email to projectGabe@alaska.gov.
A list of other resources in others states is available at the National Harm Reduction Coalition website, offering information and a "naloxone finder."
As Israel continued to press its assault on Gaza after Hamas infiltrated by land, sea and air over the weekend, killing and capturing over 1,000 Israelis, the spotlight has focused on the militant group.
Israel's leaders have vowed retaliation, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas "will pay an unprecedented price."
Hamas' political wing has controlled the Gaza Strip for over a decade, but the group is most known for its many suicide bombings and other attacks on Israel amid the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has lasted decades. It's considered a terrorist group by the United States and other nations.
Here's what to know about Hamas:
Latest updates:Israel regains control over Gaza Strip border; rocket attacks intensify
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. Hamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since.
The U.S. State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.
The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Up to 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea beginning at daybreak Saturday in an attack that caught Israel's military off guard.
Hamas leaders say they were pushed to attack because of an Israeli crackdown on militants in the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers to be illegal − thousands of prisoners being held in Israeli jails and Israel's ongoing blockade of Gaza.
Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ military wing, said “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm,” was a response to activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem that is the third holiest site in Islam. The site, which is also located on the holiest site for Jews − who refer to it as the Temple Mount − has long been a flashpoint between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli security services routinely raid the compound.
“Enough is enough,” Deif said in a recorded message. “Today the people are regaining their revolution.”
Deif leads the military wing while Yehia Sinwar, in Gaza, and Ismail Haniyeh, who lives in exile, are the senior leader of Hamas.
Israel estimates the group has about 30,000 fighters and an arsenal of rockets and unmanned drones.
A day after Hamas launched its attack, Hezbollah also fired dozens of rockets and shells at three Israeli positions in disputed area along the country's border with Syria's Golan Heights, occupied by Israel. The attack was in solidarity with the “Palestinian resistance," Hezbollah said.
Hezbollah is a Lebanese political and militant group that's been around since the early 1980s, funded and backed by Iran and spreading Tehran's influence in the Middle East.
Like Hamas, Hezbollah is designated a terrorist group by the United States and opposes Israel, but Hamas pales in comparison to Hezbollah in terms of its terrorist capabilities. The Shiite Muslim militia has also attacked Israel with rockets in the past.

WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden is set to give his first major speech Tuesday following Hamas' brutal massacre in Israel in a display of U.S. support for Israel as war erupts in the Middle East.
Biden will speak from the White House State Dining Room at 1 p.m. ET.
The address comes after Biden gave brief remarks Saturday, declaring "the United States stands with the State of Israel" and that “Israel has the right to defend itself and its people," immediately following the deadliest attack on Israel in decades.
More than 1,000 Israelis and at least 11 Americans were killed when Hamas militants crashed through the Israeli border along the Gaza Strip and launched a surprise invasion. Israel has responded with attacks on Gaza that intensified with more bombings Tuesday.
An estimated 100 to 150 people in Israel were kidnapped by Hamas militants and are being held captive in Gaza. That includes some Americans. Hamas leaders have warned they will execute hostages if Israel does not cease airstrikes on Gaza without warnings.
On Tuesday morning, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about "coordinated efforts with partners and allies" to defend Israel, the White House said.
The attack is another major foreign policy test for Biden who is already struggling to keep assistance flowing to Ukraine.
It jeopardizes the administration’s efforts to help Israel and Saudi Arabia formalize relations, one of the ways Biden had hoped would stabilize the Middle East and allow attention to be focused on the growing challenge of China.
And Republicans are trying to lay some of the blame for the attacks on the administration, pointing to a recent deal to free Americans held in Iran that gave Iran access to $6 billion in frozen funds. Iran is a longtime supporter of Hammas.
The administration has responded that the money, which has not yet been released, can only be spent for humanitarian purposes.
Hamas was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or Islamic resistance movement. The group’s charter calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel.
The political wing of Hamas was born in later years. Hamas' political wing has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2006, which prompted Israel to enforce a blockade on Gaza.
It was founded by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist organization with ties to Egypt. Iran provides Hamas with financial, material and logistical support and it also cooperates with Hezbollah, another Iran-backed, U.S.-designated terrorist group, based in Lebanon.
The militant organization is committed to the destruction of Israel and has been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., the EU and various nations.
The group has vowed to annihilate Israel and has been responsible for many suicide bombings and other deadly attacks on civilians and Israeli soldiers.
Over the years, Hamas received backing from Arab countries, such as Qatar and Turkey. Recently, it’s moved closer to Iran and its allies.
Hamas has said it attacked Israel in response to mounting Palestinian suffering under Israeli occupation and Israel's and Egypt's 16-year blockade of Gaza that has decimated Gaza's economy.
Israel has made peace deals with Arab counties in recent years but not made concessions in its long conflict with the Palestinians. The U.S. has tried to reach a deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a bitter rival of Hamas’ Iranian backers.
Meanwhile, Israel’s new far-right government was working to cement Israeli settlements in the West Bank despite Palestinian opposition.
Hamas leaders say an Israeli crackdown on militants in the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community has deemed illegal − thousands of prisoners in Israeli jails, and its ongoing blockade of Gaza pushed it to attack.
Hamas' surprise sea, land and air attack resulted in the largest one-day killing of Jews since the Holocaust.
The attack began with thousands of rockets fired from inside the Gaza Strip into Israel early Saturday. About an hour later, Hamas gunmen crossed the Israeli border at different locations and began attacking residential areas and military bases.
Hamas militants killed an estimated 260 people at the Supernova music festival in a section of open desert near Kibbutz Re’im, about 2 miles from the Gaza border. An unknown number were taken hostage.

Three days after conflict broke out between Hamas militants and Israel, the toll has risen to approximately 1,000 missing or killed Israelis, 1,500 dead militants, and at least 11 deceased Americans.
President Joe Biden has said that some U.S. citizens remain unaccounted for, and estimates show that 130 or more people were kidnapped by Hamas, with at least one American-Israeli among them.
The FBI has issued a statement assuring that, while there is no specific threat to the U.S., the agency is working with partners in Israel to find impacted Americans there. "Reports of deceased, injured or missing Americans are being treated with the utmost urgency and aggressively investigated," the statement posted on X reads.
As airlines halt flights to and from the country and The State Department issues travel advisories for the region, several elected officials have said that their constituents are reaching out for help getting out.
At least five American groups traveling to Israel have found themselves stuck in a violent and destructive dispute. Here are those groups, their shelter plans and how they've planned to make it home.
As reported by AL.com, St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, located in Daphne, Alabama, and Shades Mountain Baptist Church in Vestavia Hills, Ala.,are trying to get their members out of the Israel.
Reverend Thack Dyson is in Israel with members of the St. Paul's Episcopal Church on a tour. They started their trip in Tel Aviv on Friday, but moved to the northern part of the country when the war broke out, AL.com reported.
"Good morning and welcome to morning prayer this Sunday morning in beautiful Galilee," Dyson said in a Facebook live video posted Sunday. "We're here in the middle of a war. This is not what we planned, but this is what we got."
He has been providing updates about the group in the daily prayer videos. The group had three previously-booked flights cancelled, and as of Tuesday morning, he said that some members were able to start traveling home. The group is spreading out their journey home across several days and routes.
"We will certainly have a story to tell when we get back," Dyson said. "But we will get back."
Eleven people belonging to the Shades Mountain Baptist Church are also stuck in Israel, AL.com reported. A pastor at the church called for prayer Sunday morning, saying they are safe but hoping they return soon. Shade Mountain Baptist Church did not immediately return USA TODAY's request for comment.
Westchester County District Attorney Miriam Rocah said in a statement that a 32-member New York delegation traveled to Israel Oct. 5 for counterterrorism and anti-Semitism training.
"I am in communication with our Deputy Chief who informed me that though the delegation is close to the Gaza Strip, they are sheltering in a safe location and every effort is underway for their safe return to New York," the Facebook post on Saturday read.
The New York Times reported that they were in Ashdod, and they spent Saturday taking cover in bomb shelters. They were able to leave Sunday via a connecting flight through Dubai.
“This was not the plan, to fly into a war zone,” one of the trip organizers Mitchell Silber told The New York Times, saying it was surprising even for seasoned law enforcement officers.
WhyIs Iran behind Hamas terrorist attacks? What it would mean for US and Middle East security
A group of 12 travelers from First Baptist Church in Knoxville, Tennessee, went to Israel to follow the historical footsteps of Jesus, and now is exploring alternative ways to get out of a country that has become a war zone.
While the group might be able to depart on its scheduled flight Oct. 21, armed conflict with Hamas could render its travel plans impossible.
"We are exploring options for alternative travel in the event that we realize even where we are is unsafe," Senior Pastor Brent McDougal told Knox News, part of the USA TODAY Network, on Monday, Oct. 9, from Jerusalem, where he said the group was safe. "In the meantime, we plan to continue with as much of our itinerary until we believe that it's just untenable to stay. ... We're seeking to be wise in our decisions and ask people to pray for us."
The group, which arrived in Tel Aviv on Oct. 6, is scheduled to fly out of the city but might seek options for a flight from another country or leave sooner if violence reaches Jerusalem. For now, they are enclosed in the Old City section of Jerusalem, where sacred sites like the Western Wall and the Dome of the Rock mosque rest within ancient walls.

A group of 42 from the Morning Star Church in Dardenne Prairie, Missouri, was on a pilgrimage in Israel when the conflict broke out, reported KSDK, a St. Louis NBC affiliate.
"I know they heard sirens, I know there was a lot of concern," Morning Star Church member Trevor Wolfe told KSDK.
Pastor Mike Schreiner has been releasing video updates from abroad on Facebook. Initially the group planned to fly out of Jerusalem Sunday, but they took a bus across the border to Jordan after their flights were canceled.
They hope to be safe from the conflict in Jordan and will take varied flight paths back to the U.S., according to KSDK.

LAS VEGAS – The Green Bay Packers aren’t a talentless team.
They probably have as much or more talent than two of the three teams that have beaten them this year.
But, boy, are they a bad team.
Their offense is a mess. Their defense can be pretty good but only to a point. They are affected any time one of their starters can’t play because of injury. And they have too many players who just do what they’re told and not whatever it takes to be a difference-maker.

Lior Onaly-Kelsey celebrated their 15th birthday two weeks ago. They also celebrated the end of a years-long battle against Greater Albany Public School District.
A federal jury in Eugene this month awarded them $317,353 in damages, concluding the district had discriminated against Onaly-Kelsey when they were in the third grade and failed to properly respond to harassment and bullying.
At a park near their house, Onaly-Kelsey seems happy and curious, eagerly sharing stories about rock climbing and participating in their current school's robotics club.
Their excitement to be a teen attending a Corvallis high school is a stark difference from their emotions as an Albany elementary school student.
Indigenous land acknowledgments are everywhere.
After taking hold on college campuses, they are recited with growing frequency at schools, sporting events and church services.
They are added as signatures at the end of emails. They are being posted on the websites of museums, libraries, and other institutions as the era of racial reckoning and social justice that has followed the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement and the killing of George Floyd continues to evolve.
They are even yelled at concerts, as reggae artist Nattali Rize did during a recent show in Phoenix, drawing loud applause.
Some of the statements are as brief as a single sentence.
If “I love you” means never having to say you’re sorry, as a particularly saccharine cliche would have it, adding “Grand” to a vehicle’s name means never having to admit the one you’ve been selling was too small.

NFL power rankings entering Week 6 of the 2023 season (previous rank in parentheses):
1. 49ers (1): What else is there to say about a team that's been in the top spot since the season started? S.F.’s +99 point differential is already 20 better than the next team. Probably have the best defense (though that can be settled at Cleveland on Sunday). Might have the best offense. Stars on basically every unit. And second-year QB Brock Purdy continues to effectively play mistake-free football, his league-leading 123.1 passer rating testament to that.
2. Eagles (3): They're 5-0 in successive seasons for the first time. Next up, the Jets – a team Philadelphia has never lost to in 12 previous meetings. Feels safe to slot the reigning NFC champs at 6-0 and look ahead to their Week 7 date with Miami.
3. Lions (5): For all the focus on rookie Jahmyr Gibbs, it's veteran RB David Montgomery who's fueled a ground game with more rushes than any team in the league save two. Sunday, Montgomery became the first Detroit rusher to top 100 yards in consecutive games since … Kevin Jones in 2004.
4. Chiefs (6): Here's a stat that might surprise you – RB Isiah Pacheco leads Kansas City with 424 yards from scrimmage, nearly double TE Travis Kelce's total (222).
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
5. Bills (2): Just as LB Von Miller returns from the PUP list following last year's knee injury, LB Matt Milano (leg) could be lost for the remainder of this season. Weird as this sounds, Milano might be the more valuable player to Buffalo's defense.
6. Dolphins (7): How fast is Miami? Per Next Gen Stats, the Fins have produced the five top speeds among all plays this season and seven of the top nine. WR Tyreek Hill and RBs De'Von Achane and Raheem Mostert are responsible for them (and WR Jaylen Waddle has also cracked the top 20). Big-play Achane is averaging a ridiculous 12.1 yards per carry and 115.0 rushing yards per game, both figures best in the NFL. But seems likely a knee injury will force veteran Jeff Wilson to spot Achane in the coming weeks.
7. Jaguars (14): The first team to play multiple international games in a season is now the first to win multiple – both coming against teams with winning records. Stay in Europe, Jags – it seems inevitable, and you're apparently better for it.
8. Cowboys (4): Good thing they're not part of the NFC West … even if it would make more sense geographically. In its two defeats (to Arizona and San Francisco), Dallas has lost by a collective 70-26. Worse, the Niners seemed to expose how limited the Mike McCarthy offense might actually be.
9. Steelers (12): They've gained the third-fewest yards in the league and surrendered the third most, the delta more than 600 yards. But 11 takeaways, 17 sacks and just enough clutch plays from QB Kenny Pickett can mask such warts … and propel you to the top of the AFC North.
10. Ravens (8): It's been an uneven start, to say the least, but it's also unusual to play four of five away from home so early in the season – and Baltimore's three-game roadie winds to a conclusion Sunday in London.
11. Rams (9): Sure, they're 2-3, but they've hung tough against the league's top teams, San Francisco and Philadelphia. Appears WRs Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua will complement each other nicely, each getting at least 11 targets Sunday, Kupp's 2023 debut.
12. Seahawks (10): Coming off their bye, they're currently not scheduled to face a team with a winning record until November. Time to make serious hay toward a playoff berth.
13. Browns (13): Semi-eventful bye week with GM Andrew Berry explaining QB Deshaun Watson's last-minute scratch in Cleveland's previous game while defending the trade of obviously capable veteran QB2 Josh Dobbs during preseason.
14. Buccaneers (16): This marks three times in four years that QB Baker Mayfield has won three of his first four starts. His only 4-1 beginning led to a deep playoff run in Cleveland.
15. Saints (20): Great sidebar to Sunday's 34-0 runaway in New England. TE Foster Moreau, a New Orleans native, scored his first TD with the Saints – and first since beating Hodgkin lymphoma during the offseason. Pretty cool story amid the NFL's annual "Crucial Catch" campaign for cancer screening.
16. Falcons (18): If you know anything about the NFL, and running backs in particular, best to appreciate their genius while you can. Thankfully, Bijan Robinson has been putting his on display week in and week out, Sunday's TD catch-and-run a thing of beauty.
17. Colts (17): QB2 Gardner Minshew II may be the league's best reliever, but Indianapolis surely didn't count on him playing 50% of the snaps to this point – a figure that's going to rise as Anthony Richardson's sprained throwing shoulder heals.
18. Texans (11): No matter Sunday's outcome, this will be their best six-game start since 2019. But it would help if Houston would run the ball better after cracking 90 yards just once so far this season.
19. Titans (21): WR DeAndre Hopkins' 100-yard day courtesy of Ryan Tannehill was the 11th time he's topped the century mark with a different quarterback. Get a C-note with two more passers, and Nuk sets a league record … so might be worthy lobbying for playing time for Malik Willis and rookie Will Levis.
20. Chargers (22): Did you know WR Keenan Allen owns the NFL record for most games – three – with at least 15 receptions? With wingman Mike Williams down for the count, wouldn't be a shock if Allen extends that mark before this year is out.
21. Jets (24): Only 12 games into his career, he hardly has enough totes to qualify – but if he did, Breece Hall's 6.3 yards per carry would be a record among RBs. Unfortunately, could be hard to sustain that with OL Alijah Vera-Tucker (Achilles) headed to injured reserve.
22. Bengals (26): They'll only be on the road two more times before December, so maybe the comforts of home are good for QB Joe Burrow's calf and team focus with a brutal upcoming schedule (Seattle, San Francisco, Buffalo) for a Cincinnati club that may finally otherwise be turning the corner.
23. Raiders (28): If they're going to salvage their season and use Monday's win as a catapult, now is the time. The Silver and Black face three one-win teams (Patriots, Bears, Giants) over the next four weeks.
24. Packers (19): No worse way to go into a bye week than off a terrible loss. But Green Bay's next three opponents (Broncos, Vikings, Rams) have a combined four wins, so hopefully a good time for the Pack to get healthy figuratively and literally.
25. Vikings (25): Why is offensive balance often a virtue? Consider one-win Minnesota, which has thrown more passes (204) than any team in the league while attempting the fewest runs (91). However that calculus might have to change with All-Pro Justin Jefferson's hamstring injury forcing him to IR.
26. Bears (32): The Justin Fields-to-DJ Moore Show has sparked Chicago's revival. But look closer, and you'll also note a running game averaging better than 170 yards the past two weeks and some encouraging signs of life on defense at Washington. The schedule also suggests Da Bears could easily be a .500 team from here on out.
27. Commanders (15): Only Denver has surrendered more points than Washington's 160. Only Minnesota has turned it over more times than Washington's 10. Lethal combo.
28. Broncos (29): Naturally, when you crown yourselves with dopey "snowcapped" helmets, another Rocky Mountain meltdown is completely inevitable.
29. Giants (30): S Jason Pinnock's 102-yard pick-six Sunday is the longest play of the season NFL-wide and provided Big Blue's first TD before halftime this season. Some consolation for a team that hasn't run an offensive play with the lead yet and has now been outscored by a league-most 91 points.
30. Cardinals (27): No NFC team is blitzing less frequently – worth wondering if that's the right approach given the way Arizona's D has been torn up the past two weeks.
31. Patriots (23): If the dynasty wasn't already dead, then life support has officially been unplugged. Bill Belichick wants to "start over" after suffering the two worst defeats of his career with an offense that's been shut out of the end zone for 10 consecutive quarters and has turned it over 10 times.
32. Panthers (31): The NFL's only winless team just turned it in its worst defensive performance (42 points allowed) of the season. Its reward? A trip to Miami. Woof.

Week 5 in the NFL provided needed perspective.
In all, the slate didn't provide too many stunning outcomes or last-second twists. But four of the top 10 teams in USA TODAY Sports' power rankings suffered a loss this week, and some of the top outfits continued to separate themselves from the pack as they expanded their body of work. Meanwhile, other groups that had missteps in the first few weeks had the chance to start setting things straight − or see their seasons spiral further out of control.
Here's our full rundown of the biggest winners and losers from Week 5 in the NFL:
What's scary about the 5-0 49ers is not solely the manner in which they thoroughly dismantled the Dallas Cowboys in a 42-10 blowout on Sunday night, but rather that it all seemed a little ordinary. That's life as the clearly best team in football after five weeks.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
Still, let's not let one of the most sterling performances of the early season pass by without giving it proper recognition. Brock Purdy once again made everything look easy in the role of distributor, shelling out four touchdown passes, including three to tight end George Kittle. San Francisco managed to outgain Dallas by nearly 225 yards (422-197) and is now one of five teams in league history to score 30+ points in eight consecutive regular-season games. The defense, meanwhile, perplexed Dak Prescott and Co. throughout the contest. With the rest of the October schedule filled by teams at or below .500, it could be some time before we see a meaningful challenge for a group that has tied a franchise record with 15 consecutive wins.
Is it too late for them to offer to take either the Baltimore Ravens' or Tennessee Titans' spot in next week's London tilt to go for the triple? In handling the Buffalo Bills in a 25-20 win after last week's victory over the Atlanta Falcons, the Jaguars became the first NFL team to play consecutive games abroad. Being on the move seems to suit them well, as they are now 3-0 this year away from EverBank Stadium. 
But there were plenty of things Sunday that Jacksonville can take back home to Duval County. Trevor Lawrence pushed past some miscues to establish the electric connection with Calvin Ridley (seven catches, 122 yards) that fans had been hoping to see since this summer. Running back Travis Etienne wore down a gassed defense and ripped off a 35-yard touchdown to help put the game out of reach. And the defense kept Josh Allen off balance with consistent pressure via the blitz. With a manageable schedule before the Week 9 bye, the Jaguars have a chance to create some distance in the AFC South race and set up a favorable outlook for playoff seeding.
Netting one offensive touchdown against what is far and away the league's worst defense is nothing to brag about, but Sunday was about far more than the stats for Hackett and the New York Jets. After Sean Payton opened up to USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell by ripping into Hackett's performance last year as the Denver Broncos' coach, both the Jets offensive coordinator and head coach Robert Saleh seemed to address the hypercritical comments through gritted teeth in recent months. No need to hold back anymore, however, after Sunday's 31-21 win over Denver. Sure, maybe Breece Hall deserved the game ball over Hackett after he rescued the offense with his 72-yard scoring scamper and 177 rushing yards overall. But Hackett can now let the result – as well as the Jets' players and social media team – do all the talking for him.
In the first four weeks of the season, Ridder was a severely limiting factor for the Falcons' burgeoning offense, which averaged a league-worst 156 yards through the air during that span. This week, the second-year signal-caller was far more catalyst than caretaker in a last-second 21-19 comeback win against the Houston Texans.
Ridder completed 28 of 37 attempts for a career-high 329 yards while tallying two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing) to power the offense. Long-awaited connections with his top targets in tight end Kyle Pitts (seven catches, 87 yards) and wide receiver Drake London (six catches, 78 yards) finally materialized. And he deftly navigated the final drive, completing all five of his passes for 44 yards to set up Younghoe Koo for the game-winning 37-yard field goal as time expired. Ridder's standing never seemed to be in question within the Falcons, but this outing gives the offense something to build on.
Maybe dispatching the Arizona Cardinals 34-20 in a get-right game doesn't completely undo the myriad setbacks the team suffered in its first four games, but the Bengals appear to be on a much steadier course now. Burrow finally looked fluid and comfortable, with much of his mobility seemingly having returned after the quarterback was hampered by a calf injury since the start of the season. And just one week after he explained in frustration that he's "always (expletive) open," Chase exploded for 15 catches, 192 yards and three touchdowns. The squeaky receiver gets the targets.
For all the histrionics about Cincinnati's start, the Bengals now stand at 2-3 with their star players seemingly back in a good place. There's still work to be done, but there's no reason to write this team off.
One of the more disappointing developments of September was the steadily building training camp buzz around Pickens – the Pittsburgh Steelers' ultra-promising second-year receiver – fading into a dull hum amid persistent woes plaguing his entire offense. For one week, at least, fans got a glimpse of the dynamic downfield threat that Pickens can be.
Trailing by four with just over two minutes remaining against the Baltimore Ravens, Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett found the 6-3, 200-pound target on a back-shoulder throw for a 21-yard gain. Two plays later, Pickens dusted Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey – who was playing in his first game back after August foot surgery – for a 41-yard go-ahead touchdown in a 17-10 triumph. It's probably not the kind of play that the Steelers faithful can routinely expect from oft-criticized offensive coordinator Matt Canada. But incorporating Pickens more can only help invigorate what has been a languishing attack.
Throughout most of his time with the Cowboys, McCarthy has pounced on opponents with a significant talent deficit, allowing composed offense and opportunistic and highly aggressive defense to take care of overmatched foes. On Sunday, he got a reminder of what it's like to be on the other side of that dynamic.
It's not clear if the Cowboys could have done much differently to have had a semblance of a chance in Sunday night's catastrophic outing against the 49ers. What is apparent: As both as a coach and a play-caller, McCarthy proved to be no match for Kyle Shanahan. Dak Prescott said his three-interception night might be "the most humbling game I've ever been a part of," and McCarthy's avowed commitment to "run the damn ball" produced a team total of 57 yards on 19 carries. In what was clearly designed to be a statement game for the Cowboys after the 49ers ended their playoff hopes in the past two seasons, Dallas was outclassed in almost every facet. What McCarthy can muster might be enough to beat up on the bottom and middle tiers of the NFC, but any notion of the Cowboys beating the 49ers – and potentially the Philadelphia Eagles – on the road in January seems like a distant dream.
Suffering the two most lopsided losses of his career in consecutive weeks has left Bill Belichick and the Patriots in a particularly inauspicious spot. But there's a special indignity in the manner in which New England has dropped to this point, a bespoke misery based on Belichick's specific buttons. At the root of it all is Jones, whose head-scratching pick-six to Tyrann Mathieu in a 34-0 rout by the New Orleans Saints was the quarterback's third of the season and second in as many games. That kind of carelessness is no doubt maddening to a coach who hammers fundamentals and sound ball security. But Belichick is not merely the victim here, as his slew of personnel mistakes over the last few years – as well as his befuddling offensive staffing decisions in 2022 – have severely hampered the third-year passer's development. After pulling Jones late again in Sunday's blowout, Belichick again stood by his starter. But this pairing is looking more tenuous with each week, and Jones might need to find mentorship elsewhere to get his career back on track.
It took a truly multifaceted meltdown for John Harbaugh and Co. to squander what should have been a decisive victory. The formerly maligned receiving corps had a throwback performance in the worst way possible, with Nelson Agholor and Rashod Bateman dropping surefire touchdowns. Lamar Jackson unraveled late in the fourth quarter with an interception that paved the way for Pittsburgh's comeback and a fumble that deflated any hopes for Baltimore's own rally. And prior to all that, a blocked punt for a safety helped spark a Steelers team that had been stagnant. 
The slip-up could prove costly in the long run. The Ravens had a chance to begin pulling away from the pack in the AFC North, but instead they fell into a first-place tie with Pittsburgh. 
Whatever mojo they had from last week's statement win over the Miami Dolphins must not have made it through customs for the overseas showdown with the Jaguars. The offense was imbalanced and error-prone. The defense was trampled for 29 first downs and 196 rushing yards. 
Most worrisome, however, were the mounting injuries. All-Pro linebacker and defensive linchpin Matt Milano is expected to be out for the season with what multiple outlets have reported is a fractured leg and a knee injury, and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones suffered a pectoral injury. On Sunday, Buffalo already started to see the effect of losing top cornerback Tre'Davious White for the year to a torn Achilles, with Jacksonville's receivers too often exploiting an overmatched secondary. If the Bills don't shore things up, this could be a harbinger of the franchise's fate against the AFC's contender class. 
There's still no reason to sound the alarm on a No. 1 pick who's just four starts into his professional career. Still, after the Detroit Lions' 42-24 win over the Carolina Panthers, it's difficult to watch Young operate in this offense without wincing. A highly questionable screen to tight end Ian Thomas that ended with defensive end Aidan Hutchinson snatching the ball in mid-air will spark the most exaggerated reactions, but chalk it up to a good play by a tremendously talented defender. The second of Young's two interceptions, however, was the real cause for concern, as cornerback Jerry Jacobs baited the typically discerning signal-caller into the kind of throw he avoided throughout his college career. The signs are troubling in Carolina, as there's scant support from the offensive line or running game, and the coaching staff seems to be doing Young few favors. While this season appears to be a write-off and one that should solely be measured by Young's development, substantial change might still be required at some point. 
SANTA CLARA, Calif. – George Kittle was sitting on his sofa watching action from across the NFL on Sunday morning when a particular touchdown by a particular player caught his attention. It was a 31-yard score to Detroit Lions rookie tight end Sam LaPorta, off a flea-flicker.
Kittle, the San Francisco 49ers' star tight end, shot a quick text to his position coach, Brian Fleury.
“Dude, they ran our play,” Kittle recalled of his message. “How’d they know?
“He goes, ‘Don’t worry. We’re going to run it better.’ “
Done. Kittle hauled in a 38-yard pass from Brock Purdy off a flea-flicker – Christian McCaffrey-to-Deebo Samuel-to-Purdy-to-Kittle – for the second of his three touchdowns in a 42-10 thrashing of the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night at Levi’s Stadium.

“Yeah, it’s 10 yards farther out,” Kittle surmised. “So, I guess that counts.”
Noting that he and LaPorta are Hawkeyes, he added, “I’m never upset when two Iowa tight ends are scoring on the same play.”
It was that kind of night for the 49ers (5-0), who remained perfect with their most complete game of the season. While they handled the fundamentals with authority, they were also able to spice it up with the trick play that has been in the playbook for the better part of two years.
Kittle could see the razzle-dazzle coming. The 49ers ran the play during walk-through practices on Wednesday, Friday and again on Saturday.
“Whenever you get something run three times (in practice),” Kittle said, “you’re probably going to run it (in the game).” 
It worked like this: McCaffrey took a handoff toward right tackle, then tossed the football to Samuel, circling back on a reverse. Kittle began the play with a block on the defensive end, then released into his pass route. After Samuel flipped the football to Purdy, the quarterback fired a laser of a throw as Kittle streaked down the sideline.
Of course, the style points for the 49ers came with plenty of substance as they dismantled Dallas in myriad ways.
And you thought the gap between these teams was tight? Not so.
Take the quarterbacking. While Purdy, the NFL’s top-rated passer, tossed a career-high four touchdown passes and didn’t commit a turnover, Dak Prescott had another of those performances that will fuel skepticism about his ability to take the Cowboys to a championship level.
No, it’s not all on Prescott. His running game was feeble. Dallas’ defense couldn’t slow down the 49ers offense. And it was not the night for the Cowboys (3-2) to get into a shootout, unable to even get a first down until the second quarter (they finished with eight). Prescott had three interceptions (14-of-24, 153 yards, 1 TD, 51.6 rating) and was sacked three times.
Surely, the 49ers defense had much to do with Prescott’s troubles. No one exemplified that quite like linebacker Fred Warner. In leading the 49ers with eight tackles (5 solo), Warner notched a sack, forced a fumble with a timely punch-out of the football from the arms of Tony Pollard and intercepted a deflected pass.
Before leaving, Warner maintained that there is no such thing as luck when it comes to big-time performances. By that, he wasn’t dismissing the breaks that teams can capitalize on. Instead, he preached that preparation and skill provide impetus to the breaks.
He demonstrated that with his knack on the turnovers. Then again, it was that kind of a night.
On Saturday night, new 49ers defensive coordinator Steve Wilks told his players that they didn’t realize how good the unit can become. That’s striking when considering how many 49ers defenders remain from the 2019 team that advanced to the Super Bowl.
In any event, there was the sense that they haven’t clicked yet this season after being the NFL’s stingiest defense last season. The latest effort, though, marked a major step. In allowing just the eight first downs and four turnovers, the 49ers controlled Dallas with a 4-for-11 clip on third downs.
And the domination on both sides of the ball was reflected with San Francisco’s 37 minutes of possession.
When did Warner feel it would be that type of night?
“As soon as the offense went down on that first drive and scored, I knew we got them,” he said, referring to the game-opening, 75-yard drive capped with Purdy’s 19-yard TD throw to Kittle. “The way they’re operating right now is unbelievable. I’ve been a part of a lot of good teams since I’ve been here, but the way the offense is playing is unlike anything I’ve seen.
“That right there lets me know as long as the defense is doing our job, we’re always going to have a chance.”
Indeed. Like a chance for a special season.
The 32 things we learned from Week 5 of the 2023 NFL season:
(5)1. RIP, Dick Butkus. The Chicago Bears legend wasn’t the league’s first great linebacker, nor is he universally regarded as the best to man the position 50 years after his final appearance as a player. But Butkus exemplified football toughness. He exemplified the Bears. He exemplified Chicago at large. And he exemplified the NFL in his prime. (And I enjoyed his second phase as an entertainer, watching him in the TV series “Blue Thunder” as a kid.) Rest easy, sir.
2. The number of wins Pittsburgh Steelers QB Kenny Pickett has in three career starts against the archrival Baltimore Ravens. Pittsburgh’s offense had yet another spotty showing in Sunday’s 17-10 victory, but Pickett – playing despite on a battered knee – put the Steelers ahead for good with a 41-yard touchdown pass to WR George Pickens with 77 seconds left.
3. The number of losses Ravens QB Lamar Jackson has in four career starts against Pittsburgh, Sunday’s performance including a pair of turnovers – one a killer interception in the end zone that the Steelers leveraged into their game-winning drive in what was likely a fatal 14-point swing. Fourth-quarter miscues remain a stain on Jackson's otherwise glittering pro résumé.
4. Josh Allen > Josh Allen. The Jacksonville Jaguars pass rusher is now 2-0 against the Buffalo Bills superstar quarterback of the same name – though Buffalo’s Allen was pretty sterling (359 yards and 2 TDs passing, 1 rushing TD) Sunday in defeat at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
5. Zach Wilson > Russell Wilson. The Denver Broncos veteran quarterback outplayed the New York Jets’ third-year enigma on the stat sheet but not well enough to get the win in a game both clubs, each starting the day 1-3, needed to remain on AFC playoff life support.
6. Nathaniel Hackett > Sean Payton. The former Denver coach (and presently Jets OC) came out on the winning side against the current one, who derided Hackett this summer to USA TODAY Sports for doing one of the “worst coaching jobs in the history of the NFL.”
7. Injured Jets QB Aaron Rodgers, who defended Hackett during training camp, had looked forward to this matchup but could only contribute digitally.
8. Jets RB Breece Hall scored the go-ahead TD with a 72-yard run on the same field where he tore his ACL last season, cutting short his rookie year.
9. Jets CB Bryce Hall scored the game-clinching TD on a 39-yard scoop-and-score after Russell Wilson was stripped in the final minute.
10. We've had a terrible game of the year in successive weeks, 49ers-Cowboys following Bills-Dolphins down the chute. (And if this is how Dallas QB Dak Prescott plays when he's mad entering the week ...)
11. New Orleans Saints RB Alvin Kamara scored his 73rd career TD on Sunday, breaking a tie with Marques Colston to become the franchise’s all-time leader.
12. New England Patriots QB Mac Jones threw his fourth career pick-six at Gillette Stadium … matching the number Tom Brady ever threw in the building.
13. A 34-0 drubbing from the Saints leaves the Pats at 1-4, their worst record through five games since HC Bill Belichick’s first season in 2000. New England has lost its past two games by a collective score of 72-3.
14. The number of plays the Patriots ran on third down\. They converted one for a first down. New England never even reached the red zone.
15. The number of catches Cincinnati Bengals WR Ja’Marr Chase had Sunday, a new club record for one game, while racking up 192 yards and three TDs in a 34-20 defeat of the Arizona Cardinals.
16. The number of sacks New York Giants QB Daniel Jones absorbed over the past two games. No wonder his neck hurts.
17. After hanging another 524 yards on the Giants in Sunday’s 31-16 victory, the Miami Dolphins’ top-ranked offense now has 2,568 – most ever in NFL history through five games.
18. Dolphins rookie RB De'Von Achane’s 76-yard scoring bolt gives him seven TDs in his first four career games, most by any player to start his career during the Super Bowl era (since 1966).
19. The number of penalties in Sunday’s Bills-Jaguars game in London. Way to market the game abroad, fellas.
20. The number of points, minimum, the NFC North-leading Detroit Lions have scored in their past 14 games, a team record.
21. San Francisco 49ers RB Christian McCaffrey has now scored a TD in 14 consecutive games, tied with Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith for the fourth-longest streak in league history and three shy of Lenny Moore's record.
22. Welcome back to Indianapolis Colts RB Jonathan Taylor, who gained 34 yards on seven touches after his 2023 debut was delayed by a healing ankle and money matters. But congratulations on your new contract – one that could stabilize your positional market.
23. But who needs Taylor when you have Zack Moss, whose 195 total yards and pair of TDs powered Indy past the Tennessee Titans – the Colts’ first home win in 51 weeks?
24. Welcome back to Los Angeles Rams WR Cooper Kupp, who had eight catches for 118 yards after missing the first four weeks with a hamstring injury.
25. But who needs Kupp when you have LA WR Puka Nacua, who caught seven passes for 71 yards and a TD while continuing one of the greatest rookie breakouts in recent memory?
26. Welcome back to Buffalo LB Von Miller, who had one tackle in his first game since tearing up his knee on Thanksgiving last year.
27. And the Bills sure are likely to need him given the way their defense is being decimated by injuries, notably the one LB Matt Milano (knee) suffered Sunday.
28. Houston Texans rookie QB C.J. Stroud has thrown 186 passes without an interception, the best string to start a career in league history.
29. The Giants haven’t run an offensive play with the lead all season.
30. Flagging another artificial surface? Kansas City Chiefs superstar TE Travis Kelce injured an ankle and Vikings WR Justin Jefferson injured a hamstring Sunday, both appearing to struggle with their footing at Minnesota’s U.S. Bank Stadium. Though Taylor Swift did not attend the game, Kelce was able to shake it off, returning to catch a TD pass in the reigning champs’ 27-20 win.
31. The number of NFL teams – all of them save the Chiefs – K.C. QB Patrick Mahomes has now beaten in his seven-year career after he took down the Vikes.
32. Let’s bring this home by praising embattled Falcons QB Desmond Ridder, who hasn’t lost a home game since he was in high school. Sunday’s win over Houston improved Ridder’s mark to 5-0 at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium. He was 26-0 at home for the Cincinnati Bearcats in college.

A series of town hall forums presented by USA TODAY, the USA TODAY Network and Seacoastonline for Republican presidential hopefuls are set to take place in Exeter, New Hampshire this week.
The forums will take place at Exeter Town Hall, where many former presidents, including Donald Trump and Barack Obama, have campaigned. The forums are scheduled to take place Oct. 10-15.
Exeter Town Hall has the distinction of being the only location remaining in New Hampshire where Abraham Lincoln spoke in 1860, just months before launching his presidential campaign.
Voters who attend will have a chance to directly ask candidates the questions on their mind and receive in-person responses.
The town hall forums will be streamed on USA TODAY and on USA TODAY Network outlets including Seacoastonline.com, Portsmouth Herald, Hampton Union, Foster's Daily Democrat and Exeter News-Letter.
The five candidates that have committed to meeting with voters are Asa Hutchinson, Nikki Haley, Doug Burgum, Mike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy.
Here is the full schedule for the Exeter Town Hall forums this week. All times are Eastern.
The forums are free and open to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis. At the start of the forums, candidates make their brief opening remarks before proceeding to answer questions from the audience and engage in a meaningful dialogue about various issues.  
WASHINGTON — From fiery debates over controversial issues to promises for swing state voters, high-profile factors typically sway the results of a presidential election.
But sometimes, these factors come in the form of a state-level race a year out from Election Day. In less than a month, Pennsylvania voters will cast their ballots in the state’s 2023 Supreme Court race between Democratic candidate Dan McCaffery and Republican candidate Carolyn Carluccio.
The judge they elect could shape the 2024 presidential election.
In recent years, lawsuits over voting issues and allegations of election fraud have rocked Pennsylvania. After the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging Philadelphia officials violated state law while ballots were being tallied, which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed.
Contentious debates around Act 77, Pennsylvania’s mail-in-voting law, have also landed at the state’s Supreme Court.
But if arguments over ballots, polling places and other voting questions emerge in the 2024 presidential election, whoever is elected to the state's Supreme Court this year could be crucial as these fights play out in Pennsylvania.
"The state Supreme Court often ends up being the final arbiter of these kinds of disputes," Dan Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State University, told USA TODAY.
Here's how this state-level race could have major implications for the 2024 race for the White House.
McCaffery, a Pennsylvania superior court judge, told USA TODAY he was inspired to launch his campaign by recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions affecting Americans across the country.
He pointed to the high court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year, ending the constitutional right for women to have an abortion, as well as rulings on the First Amendment and LGBTQ rights.
“I thought it was important for me - someone with my experience -  to kind of jump into the race,” he said, describing his career as "in pursuit of social justice."
Though he hasn’t ruled on election litigation, McCaffery said that, broadly speaking, officials should "be looking to include votes, not looking for ways to disqualify votes based upon perceived technicalities.”
If Trump loses the 2024 race, the former president may bring allegations of election fraud to the Pennsylvania court.
“If he has a matter in front of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and I'm on it, he will get a fair and final opportunity to present his case fairly, and then I will make an impartial decision on the merits of the case,” McCaffery vowed.
Carluccio, a judge for the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, told USA TODAY she believes "Pennsylvanians want and deserve a just a judge who is impartial and fair, and a judge who applies law and uphold the Constitution."
She pointed to her time as a federal prosecutor representing victims of crime. And, though she hasn’t ruled on election litigation, she has served as a member of the board of elections in Montgomery County.
“I am not an activist judge,” Carluccio said.  “I cannot emphasize that enough. It is not my role, nor should it be any judge's role to change the law or to write the law or to implement policy.”
She has previously criticized Act 77, Pennsylvania's mail-in voting law. Earlier this year, she told a Republican forum that "Not much I can say, but I can tell you that Act 77 has been very bad for our Commonwealth," the Associated Press reported.
But Carluccio told USA TODAY she would apply the act, since it is state law, adding that “election laws must be applied consistently." However, she argued that there was inconsistency with the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court's rulings on undated and incorrectly dated ballots.
"It's not how they ruled," Carluccio said. "It's more that there was a little inconsistency there and people were confused. And again, our electorate deserves to understand the laws."
Pennsylvania is known to be a swing state in presidential elections, but the state’s Supreme Court race could also be a close battle as voters weigh both candidates.
Mona Cohen, a 69-year-old retired special education teacher in Philadelphia, thinks that McCaffery "has stood for equal rights for a very long time."
He “will preserve the right of everybody to vote, and the right of everybody to have unfettered access to vote and not have to face obstacles.”
“I think he's well rooted in fairness. I think that's a guiding principle,” she said.
Tina Burns, a 58-year-old healthcare consultant in Tamaqua, said "I truly believe our democracy is on the ballot, not just in 2024 but in the judicial elections, such as the 2023 (race), hence my vote going for Dan."
But Hamlet Garcia, a 52-year-old insurance agency owner in Upper Holland, said she values that Carluccio "will be a judge who will follow the law and not be a political activist."
"The judicial branch of government is supposed to interpret the law, not make the law. So I think that's what she would do,” referring to Carluccio’s record as a judge and public defender.
Michelle Nestor, a 50-year-old real estate agent and home improvement contractor in Mechanicsburg, agreed, saying she believes Carluccio "does not sway to either side. I believe she truly shows blindness to the law.”
When asked about election cases, Nestor said she believes Carluccio “will go into it with the utmost integrity.”
“I think it's important to everyone, no matter which side of the aisle you're on as a candidate, voting integrity is huge, and it's an important issue,” Nestor said. “And if anything were to arise from next year's elections that would be seen in front of the courts. I know that she would definitely uphold the Constitution and the law at the time."
The composition of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has become more competitive in recent years, according to Wesley Leckrone, the chair of political science at Widener University.
“Democrats took a 5-2 majority after winning three races in 2015. Republicans won an open seat election in 2021 to keep the status quo split on the Supreme Court,” he said. “Recent races have been contentious and flooded with campaign money. 2023 is no different.”
Currently the court has a 4-2 Democratic majority, following the death of Justice Max Baer. If Carluccio were to be elected, the majority balance between parties wouldn’t change, but she would narrow the margin. 
Michael Nelson, a political science professor at Penn State University, explained that courts often have to decide "hyper-partisan" issues, and as long a Democrats maintain control, "this election isn't likely to change the results of a lot of salient decisions."
But the race could chip away at the court's Democratic majority, especially if justices split on issues in the future. J.J. Abbott, executive director of Commonwealth Communications, who was a press secretary to former Pennsylvania Democratic Governor Tom Wolf, said that some cases are nuanced, and Democrats could take opposing viewpoints.
In cases where the courts have deadlocked, the results of this election could have big implications.
“With a current 3-3 split over counting un or mis-dated ballots, there is the potential for this election to help determine whether they should be counted,” Leckrone said. 
He added that if the 2023 race did result in a narrower 4-3 Democratic majority, future elections could flip the majority on the court, resulting in potential challenges to Act 77.
Craig Green, a professor of law at Temple University, predicted that that Carluccio’s election could cast a long shadow in the state ahead of 2024, stretching beyond races for judges.
“Carluccio’s election in 2024 would signal an immediate red shift in Purple Pennsylvania,” Green said. “It might also shift future elections in a red-leaning direction.  And both of those things might be signs of more changes to come."
WASHINGTON — Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced he is dropping his Democratic bid for president and re-entering the 2024 race for the White House as an independent.
Kennedy, an heir to the storied political family, said Monday he will no longer be running as a Democratic candidate, instead opting to pursue an independent bid for president.
"I'm here to declare myself an independent candidate for president of the United States," he told a crowd of supporters in Philadelphia. "And that's not all − I'm here to join you in making a new Declaration of Independence for our entire nation."
Kennedy during his speech on Monday criticized swaths of the economy and American political system, saying his campaign will declare independence from corporations, Wall Street, technology and pharmaceutical companies, military contractors and the "mercenary media." He also called the traditional two-party system in the United States "rigged" for voters.
Kennedy said he didn't make the decision to run as an independent lightly, saying that it's painful for him to let go of his family's longtime party.
"I've come here today to declare our independence from the tyranny of corruption, which robs us of affordable lives, our belief in the future and our respect for each other," he said. "But to do that, I must first declare my own independence, independence from the Democratic Party and from all other political parties."
The move makes Kennedy the second major third-party candidate running for president in 2024, alongside Cornel West, a progressive activist and scholar.
Kennedy, the son of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, both assassinated in the 1960s, has campaigned on a platform of fighting for the "liberties guaranteed by the Constitution."
Kennedy's sister, Kerry Kennedy, called her brother's announcement "deeply saddening" in a post on X, formerly Twitter. She added "we denounce his candidacy and believe it to be perilous for our country" and tagged her siblings: Rory Kennedy, Joe Kennedy and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.
"The decision of our brother Bobby to run as a third party candidate against Joe Biden is dangerous to our country," she wrote. "Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment."
Kennedy has had to defend many of his own claims, specifically around debunked views that vaccines are linked to autism. Vaccines do not cause autism, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.  
Kennedy referenced the unsuccessful campaigns of prior independent candidates, but argued that his would be different.
"This time it's going to be different because this time the independent is going to win," he said.
Kennedy spoke about young voters during his Monday speech and said they have have become repelled by toxicity and dishonesty in politics.
"I'm happy to say that the old political alignments are dissolving," he said. "The right and the left have become all mixed up anyhow," he said.
He also claimed that if he wins the White House on an independent ticket, he'll be "independent" of political forces other than voters.
For example, he vowed that he would pursue foreign policy focused on peace and diplomacy because he will be independent of military contractors, the private companies that do business with U.S. officials.
Kennedy's departure from the Democratic Party could shake things up in the race between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.
"They say my impact is only going to draw votes from the other candidates. The Democrats are frightened that I'm going to spoil the election for President Biden and the Republicans are frightened that I'm going to spoil it for President Trump," Kennedy said in Philadelphia Monday. "The truth is, they're both right. My intention is to spoil it for both of them."
According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll from Oct. 6., Biden and Trump are essentially tied at 35% in a hypothetical matchup that would include Kennedy running as an independent candidate. Kennedy polled at 14%, according to the survey.
When Kennedy was running as a Democratic candidate, skeptics said his platform crossed the political spectrum, ranging from that of a “Kennedy Democrat” to issues that resonate with the right and could potentially pull voters away from Trump.
The now-independent candidate struggled to label himself when USA TODAY asked him where he falls on the political spectrum earlier this year.
“I think the party definitions are so topsy-turvy right now, I wouldn’t know how to describe myself,” he told USA TODAY. “I would describe myself as a liberal Democrat, which means I’m for civil liberties, I’m against war, I’m against corporate domination, I’m against censorship. But I don’t know now − those are kind of Republican issues now, strangely.”
And Kennedy has made an effort to reach to the right. He is scheduled to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Las Vegas later this month, alongside other Republican figures.
Kennedy told USA TODAY earlier this year part of his campaign strategy is to reach all supporters − even those registered to the opposite party. He found endorsements and airtime with celebrities including Comedian Rob Schneider, NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers, actress Alicia Silverstone, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and the ultra-conservative InfoWars host Alex Jones.
Joe Rogan, a talk show host who has been critical of the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines and hosted Kennedy on his show to discuss vaccines. Kennedy in June participated with Elon Musk in a Twitter Space.
Support for a third party presidential candidate has increased, according to an Oct. 4 Gallup poll, which found 63% of U.S. adults agree that a third major party is needed and the Republican and Democratic parties do "such a poor job" representing Americans. It marks a 7-point increase from one year ago.
Some Trump allies are also supporting Kennedy. That includes former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who dedicated an episode of his Twitter show to Kennedy. Steve Bannon, a former senior aide in Trump's White House, applauded Kennedy on his War Room podcast in April.

A series of public forums for Republican presidential hopefuls will be held in Exeter, New Hampshire this week giving voters the space to help them decide who deserves their vote in the 2024 election.
Presented by USA TODAY, the USA TODAY Network and Seacoastonline, the forums will take place at the historic Exeter Town Hall, where many former presidents from Barack Obama to Donald Trump have campaigned. Voters who attend will have a chance to directly ask candidates the questions on their mind and receive in-depth responses.
The town hall forums will be streamed on USA TODAY and on USA TODAY Network outlets including Seacoastonline.com, Portsmouth Herald, Hampton Union, Foster's Daily Democrat and Exeter News-Letter.
The forums are free and open to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis. At the start of the forums, candidates make their brief opening remarks before proceeding to answer questions from the audience and engage in a meaningful dialogue about various issues.  
Here are the candidates scheduled to participate in forums at Exeter Town Hall:
Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson's forum will be held on Tuesday evening.
Hutchinson, the 72-year-old who served two terms as Arkansas governor from 2015 to 2023, bas been one of the few GOP presidential hopefuls who called on Trump to drop out of the 2024 race.
Under Ronald Reagan, he served as a U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas and joined the U.S. House where he would serve three terms. President George W. Bush appointed him director of the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2001 and he managed border security in 2003 as an undersecretary at the Department of Homeland Security.
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will address attendees on Thursday night. Haley, 51, trails GOP frontrunner Trump in her home state with 17% of Republicans supporting her nomination, according to the latest Winthrop poll.
From 2011 to 2017, Haley served as governor before stepping down and becoming the United Nations ambassador during the Trump administration. She announced her presidential campaign in February, citing her record of economic growth as governor and deep knowledge of world affairs garnered during her time as UN ambassador. 
Noting that Republicans have “lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential elections,” Haley declared: “That has to change.” 
“Joe Biden’s record is abysmal. But that shouldn’t come as a surprise. The Washington establishment has failed us over and over and over again.” 
North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum will meet with voters on the morning of Friday, Oct. 13 at 10 a.m. 
Elected governor in 2016 with little political experience, Burgum, 67, won his second term in a 40-point landslide in 2020. 
On the campaign trail, Burgum talks about his small-town roots and values and the challenges his family faced when his father died when Burgum was a freshman in high school. Burgum mortgaged the family farm to start a software company he later sold to Microsoft in 2001 for $1.1 billion. 
On the campaign trail, former Vice President Mike Pence, 64, has acknowledged he’s “known well but not well known.” He’ll do his best to change that when he meets with voters on Friday, Oct. 13 at 3 p.m. 
Before being elected the 48th vice president of the United States in 2016, Pence was a lawyer, a radio talk show host and a six-term conservative member of the U.S. House. In 2013, he became governor of Indiana.  
When announcing his run for president, Pence stated: “I know we can bring this country back. We can defend our nation and secure our borders, we can revive our economy and put our nation back on a path to a balanced federal budget. We can defend our liberties and give America a new beginning for life.” 
Businessman and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy of Ohio will bring his campaign to Exeter Town Hall on Saturday, Oct. 14 at 10 a.m. 
In his first run for political office, Ramaswamy has gained traction with Republican primary voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and across the nation. On the campaign trail Ramaswamy points to “10 Truths”: “God is real; there are two genders; human flourishing requires fossil fuels; reverse racism is racism; an open border is no border; parents determine the education of their children; the nuclear family is the greatest form of governance known to mankind; capitalism lifts people up from poverty; there are three branches of the U.S. government, not four; the U.S. Constitution is the strongest guarantor of freedoms in history.” 
Ramaswamy graduated from Harvard with a degree in biology, and has a law degree from Yale. At 38 years old, Ramaswamy made his fortune starting the biotech company Roivant Sciences, which developed five therapies that gained FDA approval. After leaving Roivant, he launched the asset management firm Strive in 2022. 
Seniors on Social Security were thrown a major bone at the start of 2023, when their benefits rose 8.7%. That cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, was the largest one to arrive in decades, and it was spurred by the rampant inflation that plagued consumers throughout 2022.
At this point, Social Security recipients are really eager to know what 2024's COLA will look like. And they won't have to sit tight too much longer.
On Oct. 12, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release September's Consumer Price Index (CPI). That report will include data from the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), a subset of the CPI.
What you need to know:Medicare open enrollment for 2024 is coming soon. Here's when it is and how to prepare.
Once that information comes in, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will be able to calculate a COLA for 2024. It typically makes that announcement right away, which means that come Oct. 12, Social Security recipients should be in the know. But whether they end up happy with next year's COLA is a different story.
Let's get one thing out of the way – 2024's Social Security COLA won't come close to the raise seniors received at the start of 2023. At this point, 2024 COLA estimates are generally coming in within the 3% to 3.5% range.
Historically speaking, that's actually not so low for a COLA. Rather, it's that seniors' most recent point of comparison is 8.7%, so a raise in the 3% range is apt to seem stingy, even if it's not.
Of course, it's important to remember that since COLAs are pegged to inflation, a smaller raise is also an indication that living costs have come down. That's apt to be a source of relief for seniors who get the bulk of their retirement income from Social Security.
No matter what 2024's Social Security COLA ends up being, seniors should be aware that a hike in Medicare Part B premiums has the potential to whittle that raise down. Seniors who are enrolled in Medicare and Social Security at the same time have their Part B premiums deducted from their benefits automatically. So if Part B gets a lot more expensive, seniors will see even less from their 2024 COLA.
How's your 401k doing after 2022?For retirement-age Americans, not so well
In 2023, the cost of Medicare Part B actually went down. That's not expected to happen for 2024. In fact, estimates from earlier this year had the cost of Medicare Part B rising from $164.90 (the standard monthly premium now) to $174.80 next year. So all told, seniors will need to wait on not just an announcement from the SSA on next year's COLA, but also for an update on Medicare premium costs.
All told, Oct. 12 is apt to be a big day for anyone who collects Social Security. In addition to a 2024 COLA announcement, the SSA will put out a fact sheet on other changes to the program, like what the wage cap looks like and what the earnings test limit will entail for Social Security recipients who work and collect benefits at the same time. So clearly, it's a good day to read or listen to the news and be on the lookout for important information.

Time’s up for millions of Americans: The final deadline to file your 2022 taxes is approaching quickly. 
Millions of people file every year for an automatic tax-filing extension beyond the original April deadline. By mid-May, more than 142 million taxpayers had filed returns, according to the IRS. But the agency expected about 168 million returns, which means more than 25 million taxpayers were waiting beyond the April 18 deadline to file. 
Now, there's no more procrastinating. The final deadline to file your tax return is Monday, Oct. 16. If you don’t meet it, expect to start accumulating hefty penalties. The late-filing penalty “can be 10 times as costly as the penalty for not paying,” the IRS said. 
The failure-to-file penalty depends on how late your filing is and how much you owe, and the clock started on the original due date of April 18, not the Oct. 16 extension deadline. Interest is also charged on penalties, meaning your balance will continue to balloon until it’s paid in full. 
The interest rate for an individual's unpaid taxes is 7%, compounded daily. The monthly late-filing penalty is generally 5% and the late-payment penalty is normally 0.5%. Both max out at 25%, the IRS said. 
Even if you owe money you can’t pay, file anyway. “The worst thing to do is not to file,” said Phil Drudy, managing director and head of tax at CBIZ MHM’s New York Tax Department.  
“If you owe money, file your return and then go start the process of working out a plan. There are several legitimate ways to pay off your debt,” Drudy said. 
Most people can set up a payment plan on IRS.gov to pay off their balance over time. Some may opt to get a loan or pay by credit card to resolve a tax debt, the IRS said. 
If you owe both federal and state taxes, try to pay off your state tax debt first.  
“States, for the most part, don’t have as robust plans and mechanisms to pay over time, and they can become very aggressive, depending on the state,” Drudy said. “Some states have private collection agencies you’ll have to deal with if you don’t pay your taxes.”  
State penalties for late filings and payments are also generally higher than IRS ones, he added. 
After the government filed criminal charges against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and some fellow executives when the company imploded, more than a million taxpayers were in limbo last spring, not knowing if they could use the IRS theft loss rule. That rule allows you to claim the loss as an itemized deduction if the theft was considered illegal in the state where it occurred and it was done with criminal intent.   
Some may have even filed for a tax extension, hoping for clarification from the IRS on how to handle potential crypto losses from the scandal.  
But “nothing has changed with FTX,” Drudy said. “We’re still in limbo.” Bankman-Fried's trial has only recently begun, so a resolution won’t come in time, he said. 
The way Drudy sees it, taxpayers have three choices: 
What happens if you're late paying:Delaying on taxes? Here's what happens if you don't pay on time.
Those with an address on record with the IRS covered by Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster declarations and those returning from a combat zone may have additional time to file. 
 They include:
◾ Taxpayers affected by flooding in Illinois and Alaska have until Oct. 31 to file.
◾ Those affected by flooding in Vermont have until Nov. 15 to file.
◾ Taxpayers affected by recent natural disasters, including those impacted by the recent Maui fires and hurricane Idalia in parts of Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Those people have until Feb. 24 to file various individual and business tax returns. Taxpayers potentially affected by recent storms should visit the disaster relief page on IRS.gov for the latest information.
◾ Members of the military and others serving in a combat zone typically have 180 days after they leave the combat zone to file returns and pay any taxes due.
If your taxes are due, file no matter what.  
Even if you’re unsure about all the line items, "you can include a statement to say the filing is to the best of your knowledge and you will adjust the filing, if necessary,” Drudy said. “What matters if they ever come and you get audited, you can say I acted in good faith" and have a better chance for reduced penalties.

Nearly 4,300 autoworkers in Canada went on strike against General Motors early Tuesday.
GM and Unifor, the union that represents autoworkers in Canada, failed to reach a tentative agreement by the time Unifor's contract with GM expired at 11:59 p.m. Monday, prompting Unifor to order a strike at midnight for 4,280 members, it said.
It is the first strike of an automaker in Canada since 1996 and comes after the union reached a tentative agreement with Ford Motor Co., which the workforce ratified on Sept. 24.
The affected facilities are GM's Oshawa Assembly Complex and CCA Stamped Products, St. Catharines Propulsion Plant and GM's Woodstock Distribution Center, all in Ontario. Unifor Local 88 members at the CAMI Assembly Plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, are covered by a separate collective agreement and continue operations. 
“This strike is about General Motors stubbornly refusing to meet the pattern agreement" the union got with Ford, said Unifor National President Lana Payne. She said the Unifor members at the GM facilities will stay on strike until a pattern agreement is met.
See UAW strike:See the picket lines as UAW strike launched, targeting big three Detroit automakers
In a statement, GM Canada Communications Executive Director Jennifer Wright said, “While we have made very positive progress on several key priorities over the past weeks, we are disappointed that we were not able to achieve a new collective agreement with Unifor at this time. GM Canada remains at the bargaining table and is committed to keep working with Unifor to reach an agreement that is fair and flexible."
Unifor's Payne said in a media briefing that the remaining key issues are the union's pension demands, income that supports retired workers and meaningful steps to transition temporary workers into permanent, full-time jobs.
“When you’re looking at an agreement we reached with Ford Motor Co. … it was economically significant, a lot of improvements. It was the first pension improvement in 15 years with our Ford members. We bargained the highest wage increases that we’ve seen bargained here in Canada," Payne said, noting the union achieved job security too around the transition to electric vehicles.
The Ford agreement includes a 15% increase in wages over the contract term and employees in a defined contribution retirement plan hired on or after Nov. 7, 2016, would be enrolled in a new pension plan in 2025 that would include monthly pensions for workers and surviving spouses. Other improvements include an increase in the monthly benefit for those workers in a pension plan.
Payne said Unifor made some progress with GM throughout Monday, but not enough for a tentative agreement.
"We’re negotiating and will stick with it until we get a deal our members will support," Payne said. "We’ve been very clear from the beginning that we expect GM to live up to this agreement with Ford … we’re showing GM that we mean business here and we want to get the pattern deal we got with Ford."
Unifor's U.S. counterpart, the UAW, has been on strike since Sept. 15 when it launched a targeted Stand Up Strike against GM, Ford and Stellantis, the company that makes Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Fiat vehicles. It's expanded the strike twice since that time to include all 38 of GM and Stellantis parts distribution centers and then to Ford's Chicago Assembly and GM's Lansing Delta Township Assembly plants on Sept 29. About 25,000 UAW autoworker members are on strike of the 150,000 in the United States.

The coveted Nobel Prizes are announced annually, and the most recent installment is here.
This year's U.S. winners included Ex-Fed chair Ben Bernanke and two other economists, two University of Pennsylvania researchers for their work in developing mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, an Ohio State University scientist and three U.S. scientists from Columbia University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Nanocrystals Technology Inc.
With over 400 winners, the United States is the country with the most Nobel Prize winners. 
The Nobel Prize is a set of awards given each year to those who “conferred the greatest benefit to humankind,” Nobel Prize founder Alfred Nobel said. 
Nobel was an inventor, entrepreneur, scientist and businessman as well as a writer. When Nobel died, he left most of his fortune to establish these prizes, reflecting each of his interests. These categories are physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. There is also the Prize in Economic Sciences, created in 1968 with a donation from Swedish central bank Sveriges Riksbank.
The nomination process for Nobel Prizes begins in September each year, with thousands of academics, scientists, past winners and parliamentary members submitting candidates. According to the Nobel Prize organization, the nominators “are chosen in such a way that as many countries and universities as possible are represented over time.”
Nobel specified in his will that Swedish institutions would be responsible for selecting the winners of the Nobel Prizes and the Norwegian Parliament was to select the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. He also asked the ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize be held in Norway. Today, Nobel Day is celebrated by presenting the Nobel Prizes on December 10, the day Nobel died. The other Nobel Prizes are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden, as requested in Nobel’s will.
The only exception to the annual affair was during World War I and II, when the prizes were not handed out. There are also a few examples of specific Nobel Prizes not being awarded, like in 1972 when the Nobel Peace Prize was not given, the committee not providing a reason for the departure.
Nobel Prizes 2023:Two Penn scientists awarded for work with mRNA, COVID-19 vaccines
All categories were honored this year and announced in October 2023. Up to three people or institutions can split the award. Here's who won:
Nobel Prize money comes from Nobel, who wanted his wealth to be invested into a fund for the prizes. The interest on that money is used for the prizes today. This year’s prize money was worth 11 million Swedish krona, or almost $993,000. 
While some of the Nobel Prize’s archived winners are known more for their contribution than their fame, there are some well-known household names awarded over the century.
Four U.S. Presidents and one Vice President have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize:
Other notable laureates, according to the Nobel Prize archives:
Only two Nobel Prize laureates have ever declined the prize. French playwright Jean-Paul Sartre had a reputation for declining all official honors, and kept up that tradition with the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature. Le Duc Tho was responsible for negotiating a cease-fire agreement with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger during the Vietnam War. The pair were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973, but Tho declined, saying he was not in a position to accept it. 
Adolf Hitler forbade three German Nobel Prize laureates from accepting the Nobel Prize, and Boris Pasternak, awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Literature, was coerced by Soviet Union authorities to decline.

What's that pest flitting around in your home? It could be a fly.
The order Diptera classifies insects that have one pair of wings, according to Smithsonian. Over 110,000 fly species have been described, but there may be more buzzing about.
Flies can be a nuisance if not kept under control. They are also known to carry diseases, such as tuberculosis and cholera, according to Orkin.
If you're experiencing an insect infestation and want to know how long flies live before you call for help, read on.
According to Orkin, houseflies undergo four stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult.
A female housefly will lay its eggs near a food source. This includes animal feces, rotting food, trash or any decomposing organic material, according to Terminix. Females can lay between five to six batches of eggs during their lifespan, states Orkin. Each batch can include 75 to 120 eggs.
It can take just seven to eight hours for housefly eggs to hatch depending on the temperature. Insects, like flies, mature faster in warmer environments, explains Terminix's website. Once they hatch, the eggs become larvae, also referred to as maggots.
Houseflies will remain in the larval stage for around one week until they molt, according to Terminix's website. Then they will enter the pupal stage before maturing into adults. The pupal stage lasts about one week.
Once they reach adulthood, a housefly's lifespan varies. This is impacted by the season, temperature, availability of food or several other factors, according to Terminix.
The average lifespan of a housefly is around one month. In general, females live for about 25 days, while males live for 15 days, states Terminix.
Fruit flies, however, live longer than houseflies. Their lifespan is about 40 to 50 days, according to Orkin. During its lifespan, a female fruit fly can lay up to 500 eggs.
If your pest problem still persists, you may need to call a removal company for assistance.
The best way to get rid of flies is to prevent them.
Be sure to secure and close windows and screens to prevent flies from getting in, Terminix reports. Regularly clean your home, especially trash receptacles. It's also important to keep sink drains clean.

With the 2023 NBA draft and the Summer Leauge in the rearview mirror and the new NBA season just about to tip off, there's a new crop of youngsters ready to make their mark across the league. 
As we get a good look at this season’s rookies, here’s what you need to know about the youngest players.
Gregory “GG” Jackson II is the youngest player in the NBA. The 6-foot-9 forward played for South Carolina in 2022 and was the No. 45 pick in the 2023 draft, now joining the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2023-2024 season. Jackson will be the only 18-year-old in the league when the season resumes on Oct. 24. He will turn 19 on December 17. 
Here are the top 10 youngest NBA players entering the 2023-2024 league:
The No. 1 overall pick is also a 2004 baby – the San Antonio Spurs’ Victor Wembanyama was born Jan. 4, 2004, making him 19 years old in July 2023. 
This year, Dallas high school student Dink Pate, 17, graduated early to join the NBA G League, making him the youngest known U.S.-born player to do so.
Detroit Pistons center Jalen Duren, 19, was the youngest player for the 2022-2023 season. He turned 19 on November 18, 2022. 
According to the NBA 2022-2023 roster survey, the average age entering last year’s season was 26.01 years old. The youngest team was Oklahoma City Thunder, with the average player age being 23.14 years old. 
NBA Summer League:Top-five picks Scoot Henderson, Amen Thompson exit with injuries
Andrew Bynum is the youngest player to have ever appeared in a regular season game at 18 years and six days old. The Los Angeles Lakers center was born on Oct. 27, 1987, and entered the NBA draft straight out of high school in 2005. 
Bynum’s draft would be the last year the NBA allowed teams to draft players out of high school, a rule that had been in place since 1995. Among other players to bypass college ball were Kevin Garnett, LeBron James and Kobe Bryant. After the 2005 draft, the NBA instituted the “one-and-done” rule, which states that players must either be 19 years old or have played at least one year at a college or university. 
LeBron James will start this season – his 21st – as the oldest player in the league. James was born on Dec. 30, 1984, making him 38 years old as of July 2023. 
Miami Heat forward Udonis Haslem, 43, was the oldest player in the 2022-2023 season. Haslem played for 20 years with Miami, retiring at the end of the season. Behind him was Golden State’s Andre Iguodala, 39, who also said he is retiring. 
The Milwaukee Bucks entered the 2022-2023 season as the oldest NBA team, with players’ ages averaging 29.47 years, last year’s roster survey reported. After the Bucks was Miami Heat at an average of 28.13 years.

In the end, President Joe Biden's immigration strategy turned out to be nothing more than just a grab bag out of former President Donald Trump’s “build the border wall” stunts.
Nobody is buying Biden’s explanation that he must build about 20 miles of border wall in Texas because money appropriated for that purpose must be spent by year’s end.
There’s always a choice. The administration could have left the money unspent and risk lawsuits from immigration hard-liners.
Biden instead elected to placate critics assailing him over asylum-seekers who have flooded the U.S.-Mexico border and the millions permitted onto American soil since the beginning of his presidency.
Biden’s border wall won’t work to keep migrants out or to placate critics.
“Walls don’t work. They are climbed over, cut through, and even blown over by the wind,” Arizona Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva said in a statement. “They are a cheaply-conceived – yet exorbitantly expensive – political stunt that does nothing to address a deeply complex humanitarian issue.”
The president himself reiterated the point yet went ahead with it.
I grew up an American – legally.Our broken immigration system forced me to deport.
Why?
Because he’s in the middle of a reelection campaign and immigration – and his inability to handle it – are his biggest liability.
At least 3.6 million migrants have entered the United States under temporary or conditional status in the past three years, according to The Arizona Republic.
The demand to help those migrants and the countless others crossing illegally are overwhelming Democratic-strong enclaves that initially welcomed them – like New York, Chicago and Massachusetts.
Immigration comments demonize crisis:New York Mayor Eric Adam's anti-migrant rhetoric makes him sound like Ron DeSantis
Democratic leaders from those states and elsewhere are clamoring Biden for financial help to meet the demand for services.
At the same time, congressional Republicans stand ready to shut the federal government down over border security that includes resuming building the wall, reports The Wall Street Journal.
This is such a hot mess for Biden that he dared to waive 26 federal laws, including the Clean Air, the Safe Drinking Water and the Endangered Species acts.
This angered environmentalists, who surely won’t forget it when they go the ballot box next year.
US immigration population:No, America is not seeing an unprecedented surge in immigration. New Census data prove it.
What exactly is Biden’s immigration strategy?
He went from “there will not be another foot of wall constructed” to let’s build it.
He went from promising to restore America’s commitment to humane immigration policies to a series of confusing directives, among them maintaining some of Trump’s harsh restrictions such as "Remain in Mexico," making it harder for asylum-seekers to qualify and swiftly deporting them.
Nothing has worked. And millions of migrants face legal limbo because immigration courts are overwhelmed and can’t adjudicate cases quickly.
What can Biden do then?
Vanessa Cárdenas of America’s Voice, which champions reforms to help immigrants gain legal status and citizenship, has good ideas. First, she said in a statement, Biden needs to level with the American people over his options to deal with complex immigration.
What else? Get immigrants to work to fill worker shortage, provide safe and orderly legal pathways to take pressure off the border, more public and private initiatives to get people signed up for work permits and a fair adjudication of their asylum claims.
Finally, greater coordination between federal and local agencies to address housing and shelter shortages.
At this point, though, it is anybody’s guess what Biden will do next on border security and the massive wave of people seeking refuge in the United States.
What we know for sure is that Biden broke his campaign promise of “there will not be another foot of wall constructed” and failing to set up a humane and orderly immigration process.

Until Saturday, I considered the Israeli city in which I live to be relatively safe.
We’re located in the center of the country, about 45 miles from Gaza and the southern Israeli communities that are frequent targets of Hamas rocket fire. During wartime, when Hamas fires rockets our way, we have about 90 seconds from when the air raid siren sounds until a possible strike, should the incoming rockets fail to be intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile defense system. That’s compared with 10 or 20 seconds in the south.
That minute and a half is enough time for my wife, children and I to make it into the concrete-and-steel reinforced room that serves as our bomb shelter – and doubles as my daughter’s bedroom.
Even during wartime, most of Hamas’ rockets are aimed beyond us, toward Tel Aviv. We know whenever the Tel Aviv area is getting bombed because one of the Iron Dome batteries that intercepts those projectiles is located close enough to our home that our windows rattle and shake from the booms.
When we heard the terrible news on Saturday about the invasion of Israeli towns by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, we were horrified even as we counted our blessings that we live elsewhere.
Hamas attacks in Israel are heinous:Hamas took advantage of divisions in Israel to start a horrific war targeting civilians
Yet our home actually is quite close to a significant seam line: the so-called Green Line boundary between Israel and the West Bank, which marked the Israel-Jordan border until the 1967 Six Day War. Today the de facto border in our area is a barbed-wire fence that runs just inside the West Bank, separating us from the territory’s 3 million Palestinians.
The fence, which in many places elsewhere along its route is a concrete security barrier, was constructed in the early 2000s ostensibly to keep Israelis safe from terrorists originating in the West Bank.
But in my neighborhood, it takes some willful blindness to rely on this illusion of safety. That’s because the fence is full of holes and gaps – some large enough for a person to crawl through, others big enough for a truck. On my frequent bicycle rides in the area, I often encounter Palestinians who have slipped through these gaps as part of their daily commute to jobs in Israel in fields such as agriculture and construction. I know that for the most part they’re just trying to make a living, and we’ve exchanged limited, mutually respectful greetings.
I’ve always figured that the Israeli authorities are aware of these gaps (an army patrol road runs along the fence) and assumed that they were taking the requisite precautions to keep us safe from potential terrorists.
Now, after the events on Saturday – when Hamas terrorists infiltrated the Gaza border fence by land, sea and air, killing hundreds of Israeli civilians, taking control of army installations and vehicles, and kidnapping an unknown number of Israelis back to Gaza – those assumptions feel naive and dangerous.
Perhaps residents of the Israeli towns near Gaza, separated from the coastal enclave’s 2 million Palestinians by their own border fence, relied on the same mistaken assumption: that Israel’s leaders were making sure they were safe.
They weren’t.
The stunning success with which Hamas attacked Israelis this weekend laid bare countless Israeli failures, from the government to the military to the intelligence services. Above all, it revealed the failure of Israeli imagination.
It turns out border defenses are easily penetrated when Israelis are complacent. Assailants armed with explosives, bulldozers and weaponized pickups were enough to overwhelm Israel’s thinly stretched and unprepared forces near Gaza.
Drones, motorized paragliders and stealthy attacks by sea provided additional avenues of invasion.
These attacks have left me shocked and saddened. I’m deeply worried about the coming days and weeks, especially for the many soldiers I know going into combat and the unknown number of Israelis now being held captive by Hamas.
I’m also newly concerned for my own family’s safety. This invasion is a wake-up call that terrible scenarios I might have dismissed as implausible actually could happen – especially if we’re not prepared for the worst.
And we can’t assume that Israel is prepared. We cannot rely on our leaders.
Biden response to Hamas attack was weak.Trump talked about hummus. US needs strong leadership to support our allies.
This is the nightmare scenario that Israelis near Gaza woke up to Saturday, and the one that all Israelis are realizing as we bolt our doors, stay off the streets, check in on relatives and friends, and mourn the dead.
I don’t have a gun in my home. I’ve never felt I needed one. The main danger for us from Israel’s fights with Hamas always have come from the air, and we have our bomb shelter. I have four children. Since Saturday, my three younger children have slept there.
After the harsh realities of this weekend, however, I’m starting to understand it’s not enough. We must prepare for other, once-unthinkable scenarios. For example, that a terrorist can show up at our front door just as they did down south. That terrorists in the West Bank could sneak through the porous security fence to try to reproduce here what happened in southern Israel.
Can I even trust that the Israeli government is handling the threat of a nuclear Iran adequately? My faith in the myth of Israeli security has been shattered.
Sunday night, I took what few weapons I have – an ax, a baseball bat, a saw – and placed them strategically around my home. We have a garden apartment, so I feel like I need to consider a possible infiltration from our yard, as far-fetched as that scenario might have seemed just a couple of days ago. I know my measly weapons are no match for a terrorist armed with a gun. But they’re all I’ve got.
As we begin to grasp the enormity of what is happening, the atmosphere in Israel is one of overwhelming sadness and despair over the unbearable losses but also of newfound determination and solidarity. In cities and towns around the country, people are mobilizing to help out with the war effort – buying and collecting supplies to send to soldiers who likely won't be home for a while, hosting families displaced from the fighting and, in so many cases, donning army uniforms and reporting for duty.
It's a bright spot amid some very difficult days behind us and ahead.

To the surprise of many, Utah became the first state in the nation last year to unanimously support making free period products available in all K-12 school bathrooms, followed a year later by providing free period products in all state buildings.
The celebration was marked by Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a former state senator, standing before the news media and a sea of pink-clad supporters, announcing that the white pants she sported that day were a reminder of the number of Senate votes she had missed during her career at the Capitol because of a lack of access to period products.
For the state that boasts the strongest economy – including employment, growth and education – legislative outcomes of issues impacting women have rarely, if ever, garnered unanimous support. In fact, Utah also finds itself ranked 50 out of 50 for women’s equality. 
These extremes beg for policy over politics. 
In 2019, after years of all-male legislative committees tossing out the idea of ending the "tampon tax" without debate, I sat in the office of a state representative, burning to explain the critical need to create policy around menstruation. 
Nervous, I described how any issue that involuntarily affects 50% of the population for four to seven days a month, for 40 years in the span of a life, was by nature a key factor in outcomes of education, privacy, public health and the economy. I locked eyes with him and added that because of the spontaneous nature of periods, it would be by the grace of God that I’d make it through the meeting without leaving my own personal mark on his couch.
He became an avid supporter.
Period poverty:It's past time we ended the stigma – and tax – on periods for girls around the world
From that moment on, period policy became a movement unlike others – one that put policy above politics.
And because of that, the movement looked different. It did not look like the polished lobbyists or political strategists of the Capitol. It looked like dads at rallies, supporting their daughters who wanted to be a part of something bigger than themselves. It looked like women with strollers and kids realizing just how much their voices echoed in those marble halls.
It looked like handwritten signs proclaiming, "Girls are worth it. Period." Like philanthropists understanding that investing in policy meant dollars reaching every corner of a state. Like teenagers wanting social change and Wednesday-workout groups giving their extra time for good. It looked like hijabs, high-tops and hipsters.
There was no distinction among parties. No one-sided political ideology that blocked passage or made ridiculous demands. Just movement. Momentum. And a thirst for thoughtful, economically and equitably sound change.
Since that time, the nonprofit I lead, The Policy Project, has been able to identify other overlooked needs in our community. We secured statewide funding for more than 60 teen resource centers in high schools focused on providing services for students experiencing homelessness and other mental and physical hardships to meet their basic needs. This includes laundry, food pantries, showers and toiletries, family advocate workers and mental health support. Utah is first in the nation to do this. 
The movement to end hunger is underway.We support families battling food insecurity.
There is so much more good to be done. Our plan for 2024: child sexual abuse prevention.
And the idea is spreading. We are now helping tackle issues with partners in Idaho, Oregon, New Mexico and as far east as Alabama. 
The Policy Project is establishing a track record of generating unanimous support in the legislature and creating a blueprint that other states can use to navigate beyond political and territorial lines to accomplish public and societal good.
Our mission is straightforward – remove barriers to opportunity by going upstream – creating solution-based policy at all levels of society, recognizing that issues are not right or left. Issues are human. 
We have discovered that in an environment where the majority is exhausted by the margins of the political spectrum, there is a deep hunger for something that feels like progress. Like we’re using the extreme access to wealth, education and opportunity to move the needle for everyone in society. That if we, as citizens, create that demand for healthy, moderate policy, our politicians will have to respond.
Policy trumps politics.

The horrendous terrorist attack against Israel this weekend by Hamas terrorists underscores the vital need for strong leaders in the United States who will stand by our allies. 
That is all the more important given the presidential election next year. Who will lead the United States matters more than ever given the turmoil around the world. 
This is Israel’s equivalent of our 9/11 (and is even more devastating given Israel’s much smaller population), with more than 700 killed and thousands injured. At least 11 Americans were killed in the Hamas attack. 
If you haven’t watched some of the many awful videos of these terrorists wreaking havoc on civilians, including women, children and the elderly, you should. More than 100 civilians and soldiers were taken hostage, and who knows what their fate will be. 
It’s easy to say “stand with Israel,” but there’s good reason to question what many of our politicians actually mean by saying these words. 
Hamas' heinous attack on Israel:Hamas took advantage of divisions in Israel to start a horrific war targeting civilians
For instance, President Joe Biden erred in his initial response to the attack. The Biden administration’s Office of Palestinian Affairs called on Israel “to refrain from violence and retaliatory attacks.” It later deleted that post.
And rather than issue the first statement himself, Biden’s National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson stated: “The United States unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians. There is never any justification for terrorism.”
Biden later expressed his support for Israel, but it should have come from him right away. The president is already getting serious backlash given the timing of this attack, for good reason. It was just weeks ago that the Biden administration unfroze $6 billion in Iranian assets in exchange for American hostages. 
The White House claims that the money can go only toward humanitarian means. That's hogwash. All money is fungible.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran is behind these attacks, as a hater of Israel and a backer of Hamas. Hamas terrorists have outright credited Iran for its assistance.
Does GOP want to win?2024 should be cakewalk for Republicans, but they're determined to give failing Dems a win
Other Democrats, like Michigan's U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (who has never been a friend to Israel), issued statements equating losses in Palestine with those in Israel. Others such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have called for an “immediate ceasefire and de-escalation,” indicating they don’t support Israel’s justified efforts in rooting out the terrorists from Gaza.
Then there’s responses like the one from my governor in Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, who issued this embarrassingly wishy-washy statement that managed to say nothing: “I have been in touch with communities impacted by what’s happening in the region. It is abhorrent. My heart is with all those impacted. We need peace in this region.”
Hours later, when the polling probably started to look bad, she followed up with a more direct post. 
This attack happened just after Republicans created unnecessary chaos by ousting House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week. The House is effectively without a GOP leader in charge, at a time when leadership is a must. 
Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, in organizing the coup, has essentially turned the House over to the Democratic minority leader, whose caucus is full of folks who don’t fully support Israel.
Americans also should pay close attention to how Republican presidential candidates handle their response. As some in the GOP are bowing to populist demands that America isolate itself from involvement in Ukraine, it's of utmost importance that Republicans nominate a candidate who understands what's at stake in Israel. 
Nikki Haley beats Biden in polls.Voters want someone else in 2024. Why not Nikki Haley?
Over the weekend, both former Vice President Mike Pence and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, also a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, came out strongly against the Hamas terrorists. Haley is absolutely correct in saying the United States should see the attack as not just against Israel, but also against American interests.
There was no equivocation in her response to the terrorists, in telling Israel to “finish them.” 
Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump reacted in part by calling out “hummus” at a campaign event. 
It’s true that America faces many of its own challenges now, including a border that is way too open, even to those who might wish us harm. 
That is not an excuse to abandon our allies when they need us most. If the United States shows weakness or careless disregard – or elects officials who do – it will be to our country’s peril.

Every time he goes on social media, Aziz Abu Sarah feels sick to his stomach. The Palestinian man has Jewish friends who've lost family members. Friends taken hostage.
"I worry for them like I worry for my Palestinian friends who are in Gaza now, living under bombardment of air strikes," says the author of "Crossing Boundaries: A Traveler’s Guide to World Peace." "We need to see the nuances."
Social media, however, often renders nuance obsolete.
Misinformation and propaganda about the Israel-Hamas conflict – which has resulted in more than 900 Israelis and upwards of 680 Palestinians dead, just days into a new war – fills social media feeds and shows no signs of slowing. Some posts mention the death toll on only one side. Some ignore the civilians taken hostage. Some fail to mention Israel's occupation of Gaza. Some don't account for why Jewish people around the world grow afraid.
These posts often come from those far away from the conflict, like in the U.S., who feel like they have to say something for the sake of seeming involved. But declaring support for one "side" over the other and listing out-of-context information about Israelis and Palestinians may hurt more than help your cause.
Infographic social media posts trying to detail a topic as fraught, as frustrating, as long-lasting as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will always lack critical details due to social media's bite-size commentary nature. Experts warn you should seek greater context before sharing anything. It's perfectly acceptable – and even preferred – for you to stay quiet if you don't know enough about what you're talking about.
"Not everything is black and white," Abu Sarah says. "And to me, it's most painful when I see people I know, people who I respect, people who I love, who have fallen for these (posts) and feel that they need to serve 'their country, their cause, their people,' whatever, by spreading misinformation. It's devastating to me."
Abu Sarah worries the propaganda and misinformation could be result in deadly consequences, for those in the Middle East and elsewhere. "People will read it, get angry and do things."

Websites like Instagram and X, formerly known as Twitter, speak in soundbites, not dissertations.
"You only have a certain amount of space where you can post your tweet or one photo or two, and it doesn't necessarily lend itself to any kind of nuance, or real, significant conversation," says Shaya Lerner, the director of Israel Affairs at the Anti-Defamation League.
The sites have historically faced difficulty combating antisemitic and Islamophobic posts.
Plus, "we know that algorithms can trend toward feeding people polarizing and extremist content to keep them clicking," says Sarah Parkinson, assistant professor of political science and international studies at Johns Hopkins University. "The lack of moderation makes it easy for individuals and organizations to harass people into silence."
Social media infographics, of course, can be helpful resources in educating those completely uninformed. It's when people don't go beyond theses sources that trouble looms. Rabbi Rick Jacobs, President of the Union for Reform Judaism, says: "There are positive, important things that we can do with postings on social media. But the boundaries are not clear. And the abuses are quite evident."
Jacobs says some of the posts he's seen have hurt.
"I, every day, would not only defend but really strongly defend the rights of Palestinians to have dignity and human rights," Jacobs says. "But for me to say that (Hamas) this group of terrorists who are trying to literally murder women and children and families and rip families apart and take them captive, and (for some on social media) to be able to say with a straight face, this is such a noble thing they're doing. That just offends every sensibility I have."
Many argue that the decades of violence against Palestinians under Israeli occupation warrants mentioning to better contextualize the attack on Israel.
"The cancer patients in Gaza who can't receive medical treatment, because they're not allowed out of the enclave, and yet they die as a result of that, that's violence," says Saree Makdisi, UCLA professor and author of "Palestine Inside Out: An Everyday Occupation."
He wants to see instances like these illustrated more on social media, which is often too simplified: "It's not all big explosions, and fires and rockets and tanks and this kind of thing," he adds.
How to cope:The videos out of Israel, Gaza are graphic, but some can't look away
So if social media infographic posting and re-posting isn't the right answer, what is?
"My advice to people is always to read a broad spectrum of media outlets, including media from the region, and to understand what it is that they’re reading," Parkinson says. "Search the outlet, read a Wikipedia page on it; don’t just go to one news source to understand any situation. Verify that what you’re reading a credible outlet or source. Seek out local voices and establish who they are."
Makdisi adds: "It's important to understand the context and the history of this violence, where it's come from, where it's going, and what the possible solutions are, that involve peace and justice for all sides." Granted, what peace and justice look like, and if it's even achievable, differs depending who you're asking.
That doesn't mean social media is useless, either. Abu Sarah suggests following those who have different points of view. He also recommends sharing stories of unity: "There are today, Israelis and Palestinians who are doing the impossible to support each other. I can tell you dozens of these stories and yet unfortunately, those are the missing stories, whether it's on social media or in our discussions."
If you decide to post something, don't expect everyone to agree with you. "Remember that many on social media already have their minds made up and will respond to what they 'think' you are saying rather than your actual words," says psychologist Reneé Carr.
When you stop thinking of the other "side" as human, you've lost. Abu Sarah adds: "If you think one side is a pure evil and one side is pure good, you're missing the story."

Americans can't seem to get enough beef. From juicy burgers to tender steaks, many of us line up at fast food restaurants, dine in at steak houses, or crowd around the grill at backyard barbecues. For the companies providing those cuts and patties, business is good – to the tune of nearly $500 billion, according to one market analysis. 
But for the consumer, does eating all that meat have a negative health effect? Experts weigh in on the raw truths of consuming red meat. 
The first question many people have is what constitutes a meat as being "red?" In general, it's meat that is red when raw, usually coming from non-bird or non-fish sources. "For simplicity, think of any meat coming from an animal with four legs as red meat," offers Kearson Petruzzi, a registered dietician for Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. Such meats have that distinct color because they contain more myoglobin than chicken or fish. The amount of myoglobin in animal muscles determines the color of the meat, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Dr. Donald Hensrud, an associate professor of preventive medicine and nutrition for Mayo Clinic and the editor of “The Mayo Clinic Diet,” says red meats "include beef, veal, pork, lamb and venison."
As with any part of a healthy diet, red meat provides only some nutrients. For its part, "red meat provides iron, zinc and B-vitamins," says Petruzzi. Indeed, red meat is one of the main dietary sources of vitamin B12 in particular. Red meat also contains modest amounts of the mineral selenium and the vitamin niacin. 
Josh Redd, NMD, the founder of RedRiver Health and Wellness and author of "The Truth About Low Thyroid," says that "red meat is also an excellent source of high-quality protein that's more easily absorbed than plant proteins." Lack of protein, he says, "can make it harder to maintain muscle mass and metabolism and to have good immune resilience."
When getting such protein from meat sources, Redd says it's helpful to remember that ounces of meat are not equivalent to grams of protein. "An ounce of meat has about 7 grams of protein," he explains. That means a single 6-ounce steak has 42 grams of protein – already approaching the daily intake of protein the CDC recommends. 
It's also worth noting that there are many other sources of protein beyond red meat that include beans, eggs, cheese, Greek yogurt and other animal meat. Petruzzi adds that the vitamins and minerals found in red meat are also found in poultry, fish, nuts and plant-based sources.
Yikes:Carnivore, lion diets called life-changing online. But is eating only meat really good for you?
Consuming red meat, then, is not essential to a healthy diet, and may even pose some health risks if consumed too frequently. General recommendations are to have red meat no more than once per week.  
Mayo Clinic notes that leaner cuts of beef can be part of a healthy diet and suggests sticking to ones like top sirloin and top or bottom round roasts. Some of the most concerning red meats include ham, bacon and salami. Significant consumption thereof has been linked to Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. 
Another thing to consider when indulging in red meat is the other foods one is already consuming. "For the average American who is eating way too many sugars and carbs, they’re going to want to especially minimize their consumption of saturated fats and red meats," says Redd. He explains that's because high-carb diets raise levels of insulin and blood sugar.
Petruzzi similarly warns against the saturated fat contained in red meat and notes that red meat can also raise one's LDL cholesterol levels – the "bad" cholesterol we need to avoid. What's more, the World Health Organization has classified red meat as a group 2A carcinogen.
Hensrud says that because there is no health requirement to include red meat in one's diet and because there are healthier sources of the nutrients it provides, the risks may outweigh the benefits. "Generally, the less red meat you eat, the better."

The videos are graphic.
Cable news airs them, but often with a warning. “There are images that I want you to see now, and I have to warn you that what you are about to see is disturbing,” CNN anchor Becky Anderson says before sharing a clip.
Female Israeli hostages being paraded through the streets, one being taken away on a motorbike by terrorists, begging for her life. An Israeli mother and her two children being held by terrorists in an unknown location. In Gaza, buildings are reduced to rubble and images of sobbing Palestinian children are going viral.
Much of the crisis is unfolding on social media, with TikToks from around the country showing the horrors − the wounded, the bloody, the destruction on both sides of the conflict.
For American Jews, it feels deeply personal, says Rabbi Motti Seligson, Director of Public Relations for Chabad.org.
“The proximity is real – it’s families, it’s friends,” he explains. “It’s like ISIS overrunning Cleveland. You know someone in Cleveland.”
Like many orthodox Jews, Seligson was not on his phone or turning on the TV as he observed the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, which concluded Sunday after dark. The holiday marks the end of the reading of the Torah and a return to the beginning.
“The entire community was observing the holiday and that meant that we weren’t on the internet, but word spread very quickly about what was transpiring. It was shocking.”
Still, it wasn’t until he got on his phone he was able to “appreciate the scope and level of brutality” of a story that is largely unfolding in videos.
“You’re talking about teams of terrorists that were going home to home to torture, murder complete families – children, elderly people – kidnapping them and taking them hostage,” he says.
Ryan Brown, on the other hand, has had all weekend to digest what's happening. He woke up on Saturday morning to a phone filled with notifications from his family and friends, alerting him to the situation in Israel. Brown has many friends in Israel and lived in the country for several months on two separate occasions. He has visited more than a dozen times.
The 30-year-old gets a lot of his news from his social media feed, but it's hard-to-watch. “It’s jarring to see the videos and the abuse of human rights of women and grandparents and children and the mass killings.”
But it’s important we see what’s going on, Brown says.
“This is a wakeup call to American Jews that you don’t have the luxury of looking the other way, of not getting involved.”
Aziz Abu Sarah, author of "Crossing Boundaries: A Traveler’s Guide to World Peace," understands the complications around viewing disturbing images and videos.
"On one hand, I want people to understand and to be shocked, but unfortunately, the way those images are now used isn't to get to us to understand the horrors of war, and the need to come to our sanity and figure out how to stop the killing, and instead is to mobilize more people and mobilize more anger," says Abu Sarah, who is Palestinian.
Yet it is important for people to see what is happening "particularly when it comes to the harms civilians suffer and the effects of collective punishment," says Sarah Parkinson, assistant professor of political science and international studies at Johns Hopkins University.

So how should people balance their desire to get the news, the whole story, with their mental health as videos display things they can't unsee?
Experts say it’s important to be mindful of your mental health when your feed shows graphic content.
"It's a really fine line, between, taking care of yourself and protecting yourself from witnessing just this depraved violence and this evil," says Rabbi Elaine Glickman, assistant executive director of Women’s Rabbinic Network. "And yet, the importance of not looking away and the importance of bearing witness."
If you're firmly stuck in your belief one one side, consider putting yourself in someone else's shoes. "If it was a group of Israeli soldiers, if you're pro-Palestinian, and they went inside a Palestinian village and did what Hamas did, how would you feel?" Abu Sarah adds. "Would you be also saying 'oh, this is totally fine.' And then vice versa. How would you feel if you're pro-Israel, and the bombardment in Gaza is happening and you see families being killed and with the bombings, how would that make you feel?"
And take care to be sure you do not grow numb to what you see.
"The repeated posting of graphic images can lead to desensitization and dehumanization, where people become numb to what they are watching, stop seeing victims as individuals who have lives and families and stop caring," Parkinson explains.
It's OK to take a break from social media, too − even if you're a news junkie. "Many people who live this violence every day, or who have lived it in the past, stay offline during times like these given how traumatizing viewing these images can be," Parkinson says.
Paris is riddled with bedbugs, according to dozens of videos online that show the critters looking for their next host on buses, trains, hotels and more. Now, some people are documenting their own bedbug battles after traveling from Paris, sparking fear of impending infestations in other cities and countries. 
The bedbug hype is enough to get your skin crawling but understanding the difference between real and perceived fears, preferably long before an actual threat emerges, could save you from unnecessary anxiety. 
“Bedbugs are not everywhere, but they can be anywhere,” said Jody Gangloff-Kaufmann, an entomologist with Cornell University and coordinator of the New York State Integrated Pest Management community program. “If there are blood-feeding critters roaming in your bed and you can't see them, but you feel every little itch, it can be overwhelming and lead to sleepless nights, anxiety and shame.”
The trick, entomologists say, is to not only be mindful of how the Paris bedbug news can affect you mentally but also understand the nature of what’s happening in the City of Love (spoiler alert: it’s pretty normal). 
It’s normal to feel nervous about a potential bedbug infestation in the U.S. as major events like Paris Fashion Week make headlines. The good news, experts say, is that what’s happening in Paris isn’t unprecedented – and that an outbreak in the U.S. is unlikely. 
“We've been dealing with bedbugs in the U.S. in a very big way since about the year 2000,” Gangloff-Kaufmann said. “Paris is the same; London is the same; Australia is the same – everyone's had this resurgence. So it's nothing new.”
Social media videos are sensationalizing the bugs’ normal behavior, she said, especially as the city prepares for the 2024 Olympics. Instead, resistance to pesticides, increased international travel and changing pest control practices are to blame for the general uptick in bedbugs worldwide, experts say.
Therefore, it’s unlikely that the U.S. will experience a surge in bedbugs, said Jerome Goddard, an extension professor of medical and veterinary entomology at Mississippi State University who has studied bedbugs’ psychological toll: “We have them here. They have them there.”
Anticipating a bedbug attack could be just as stressful as actually experiencing one, particularly if you have a phobia of bugs (entomophobia), experts say. 
A case series published in 2012 in the journal Psychosomatics found that even after repeated confirmation that their homes were bedbug-free, some people continued to visit dermatologists to locate bug bites, dispose of their furniture, obsessively clean their homes with bleach, feel biting sensations at night, change housing multiple times, and isolate themselves from friends and family.
People in the midst of an actual infestation experience similar and sometimes more serious emotional and behavioral upheaval.
Goddard reviewed 135 online blogs about bedbugs and found that 81% of them reported psychological symptoms associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, such as nightmares, insomnia, anxiety, flashbacks, hypervigilance and avoidance behaviors. 
Learning about where bedbugs come from, how to tell if a hotel or your bed has them and what to do if you find the critters, can ease your worries about a potential infestation, experts say. 
How to identify and control bed bugs:Bedbugs are blood-sucking pests. Here's how to identify and control the tiny invaders.
In some cases, guidance from a mental health practitioner may be necessary. Notify a therapist or other professional that you’re dealing with bedbugs or worried about a future problem; they’ll give you tips to control stress and anxiety. 
Fortunately, bedbugs aren’t known to spread disease, so the bites themselves are relatively harmless, besides some irritation and a possible allergic reaction.
Consider, too, whether you or a loved one might be at risk of a bedbug problem, Goddard said. People who live in lower income neighborhoods, for example, might not be able to afford professional pest control and are more likely to face long-term issues; people with certain cognitive or intellectual disorders may not be capable of keeping up with best practices to avoid or eliminate bedbugs; and anyone who moves around a lot, sleeping in beds shared by others also face greater risks.
“Bedbugs aren’t supernatural, they don’t fly and they’re easily killed,” Goddard said. “They really aren’t as terrifying as they sound. Learn to recognize them and understand their behaviors – knowledge is power.” 
Will Ferrell knows how to throw a party!
The "Barbie" star and comedian stole the show at parents weekend at the University of Southern California during a tailgate party ahead of the school's big football game against the University of Arizona Wildcats.
Ferrell, whose eldest son Magnus is a sophomore at USC, took a page from his 2003 film "Old School" in returning to his alma mater. Instead of an attempt to relive his glory days, the actor took center stage as DJ at a Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity party.
In videos shared to social media, Ferrell had a crowd of hundreds of college students dancing to Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" and Jay-Z and Kanye West's collaboration "(Expletive) in Paris," the latter of which includes a snippet from his movie "Blades of Glory."
The "Strays" actor was all business in a backwards USC cap, sunglasses, a zip-up sweatshirt and headphones while he worked a turntable.
In addition to Ferrell's son Magnus attending USC, the actor is a 1990 graduate of the university with a bachelor's degree in sports information.
Ferrell has been back to his alma mater several times since graduation, most notably in 2017 when he delivered the commencement speech and received an honorary doctorate degree.
"It is incredibly surreal, one might even say unbelievable, that I get to deliver this address to you. As a freshman in the fall of 1986, if you were to come up to me and say that in the year 2017 you, Will Ferrell, will be delivering the commencement address for USC, I would have hugged you with tears in my eyes," he told the USC class of 2017.
The 10 best Will Ferrell movies,ranked (from 'Anchorman' to 'Barbie' and 'Strays')
Ferrell recounted all the times during his four years at USC when he subconsciously prepared for life as a comedian and trusted his intuition despite getting a degree aimed at sports broadcasting.
"To those of you graduates sitting out there who have a pretty good idea of what you’d like to do with your life, congratulations. For many of you who maybe don’t have it all figured out, it’s okay. That's the same chair that I sat in," he added. "Enjoy the process of your search without succumbing to the pressure of the result."
Ferrell ended with words of encouragement. "Trust your gut, keep throwing darts at the dartboard. Don't listen to the critics and you will figure it out," he said.
'Strays' review:Will Ferrell's hilarious dog movie puts raunchy spin on 'Homeward Bound'
NEW YORK – Hey, old friend.
More than 40 years after notoriously flopping on Broadway, “Merrily We Roll Along” is back with a splendid and shattering revival at the Hudson Theatre starring Jonathan Groff, Lindsay Mendez and Daniel Radcliffe.
Originally directed by Hal Prince, with a marvelous score by Stephen Sondheim, the decades-spanning musical follows the rupture of a friendship but is told in reverse. The story begins in 1976 with the bitter falling-out between three middle-aged chums and eventually ends in 1957 with their starry-eyed first meeting in college.
The show's 1981 production featured a mostly teenage cast and was roundly rejected by critics for its muddled design and backward structure. Audiences were similarly unmoved, and the musical shuttered just 16 performances after opening night.
Now brilliantly reimagined by director Maria Friedman, this crushing new “Merrily” evokes the spirit of a haunted house, as jaded movie producer Frank Shepard (Groff) wanders through his stark Los Angeles abode, reflecting on the dreams and companions he left behind in New York. Those include Charley Kringas (Radcliffe), his modest former songwriting partner; Mary Flynn (Mendez), a theater critic with an unrequited crush on Frank; and Beth Spencer (Katie Rose Clarke), his ex-wife and an aspiring singer.
Some of Friedman’s most obvious fixes are cosmetic. The original production was made to resemble a high school gymnasium, and actors wore plain T-shirts with their characters’ names splashed across their chests. Here, there’s no confusion about when and where the story takes place, thanks to Soutra Gilmour’s swank period sets and effortlessly chic costumes. The revival cast is also age-appropriate, allowing them to more effectively run the gamut from youthful optimism to the wistfulness and cynicism of adulthood.
But some of the most vital shifts are in the story itself. The show’s central conflict revolves around Frank and Charley, who co-wrote the songs for a wildly successful yet frivolous Broadway musical. Charley wants to leverage their newfound fortune to finally get their longtime passion project off the ground, while Frank is content to follow the dollar signs to Hollywood and beyond.
Loved 'Book of Mormon?'Josh Gad, Andrew Rannells are back with hilarious new 'Gutenberg!'
While past “Merrily” productions may have painted Frank as a mere sellout, Friedman recognizes that it isn’t so black and white. Here, we more clearly understand the financial burden of Frank’s messy divorce, and that the romanticized life of a struggling artist is no longer prudent with a young son at home. Self-serving or not, he also enjoys the fabulous parties and pals that come with fame, including his leading lady-turned-mistress Gussie Carnegie (a scene-stealing Krystal Joy Brown).
“Why is it old friends don’t want old friends to change?” Frank sings in the perceptive “Growing Up,” suggesting that he hasn’t abandoned his dreams but simply “readjusted” them.
Groff, who last appeared on Broadway in the original cast of “Hamilton,” has never been better than he is here, imbuing a tricky character with tearful sincerity and charm. Mendez is a hilarious knockout as the acerbic Mary, bringing powerhouse vocals and aching vulnerability to showstoppers “Now You Know” and “Not a Day Goes By.”
As Charley, Radcliffe is the tender, open heart of “Merrily.” The sprightly “Harry Potter” star, now in his fifth Broadway outing, infuses his stubborn lyricist with brio and palpable hurt. He deftly zips through the spiky tongue-twister that is “Franklin Shepard, Inc.,” and his gentle rendition of the show’s signature tune, “Good Thing Going,” is a quiet stunner.
“Merrily” is the latest in a flood of Sondheim revivals, following the legendary composer’s death in 2021 at 91. Since then, “Company,” “Into the Woods,” “Assassins” and “Sweeney Todd” have all graced New York stages to varying degrees of success, while an unfinished Sondheim musical, “Here We Are,” is playing a limited run off-Broadway.

But “Merrily” is the most top-to-bottom perfect production of them all, from its muscular orchestrations to its vibrant ensemble to its sneakily devastating book by the late George Furth. Part of what makes the show so overwhelmingly emotional is that it transports us back to a more idealistic age: when possibilities seemed endless, friends were forever, and hopes weren’t yet dashed by life’s realities.
"It's our time, breathe it in," Frank sings at the end of the show, as he readies to take on the world with Charley and Mary by his side. The same could be said of "Merrily," which four decades later, finally feels right on time.
The Guns N' Roses concert at Chase Field on Wednesday has been canceled so the Arizona Diamondbacks can host Game 3 of the best-of-five National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers that night.
But, Guns N' Roses are still playing.
They've just moved it down the road to the Talking Stick Resort Amphitheatre.
"Congrats to the Arizona Diamondbacks! As the playoffs land on Oct. 11, unfortunately the Chase Field show has been canceled," the band announced on Instagram Friday. "We have added a new show in its place on the same day at Talking Stick Resort Amphitheatre. We aim to accommodate as many Phoenix fans as possible."
People who had tickets to the band's show at Chase Field were eligible for a refund and given a presale code to purchase tickets at the new venue.
Many fans, however voiced their frustration with Chase Field for double-booking and the new process to go to the concert.
"Stadium’s staff didn’t believe the team would make it to the playoffs," one fan commented. Another added: "The AZ Diamondbacks executive office are at fault for this snafu— should have never happened."
One ticketholder commented, "This is a slap in the face for the people who bought txs early and have good seats.. They had to plan another day in the same stadium and grant the same Ticket."
"I now can not stand (my mom taught me to not use the word hate) the Diamondbacks organization for costing me a couple thousand to rearrange my plans to see GnR. Very conveniently they postponed then ‘canceled’ the show. Moved it to a smaller place. Gave you 24 hour window on a weekend to purchase a new ticket. But refund does not come till sometime later. Aggravating," another fan commented.

John Legend’s reign on “The Voice” has the Queen of Country resorting to some unregal measures.
Legend and coach Reba McEntire, alongside fellow coaches Niall Horan and Gwen Stefani, battled for singer Lila Forde during the fifth round of blind auditions Monday night. The Seattle vocalist scored a four-chair turn with her bluesy tone and piano-driven rendition of “Can’t Find My Way Home” by Blind Faith.
Stefani was so moved by the 24-year-old singer’s “beautiful” performance that she removed her shoes and walked down the stage for her pitch. “This is what the world needs. We want a singer-songwriter with a true point of view that’s original, unique (and) that’s not trying to be like anyone else,” Stefani told Forde. “You’re my dream ‘Voice’ girl to work with.”
Meanwhile, Legend was impressed by Forde’s vocal maturity. “What I heard was wisdom. You understood everything you were saying,” he said. “But everything felt completely under your control.”
In the end, Forde selected Legend as her coach. The victory prompted McEntire to express regret for not using her block button on the self-proclaimed “four-chair king.”
“I was going to wait, but John is on a roll,” McEntire said afterward. “We’ve got to block John.”
Here’s what else went down on Monday’s episode.
Singer JaRae Womack captivated the coaches with her haunting performance of Amy Winehouse’s “Back to Black,” earning the Florida vocalist a four-chair turn.
“On big songs like this with such character voices, people tend to try and follow whoever that artist may be,” Horan said. “You completely made it your own.”
Determined to get Womack on his team, Horan knelt on the stage to convey his passion to coach the 35-year-old singer, who is the granddaughter of R&B singer-songwriter Cecil Womack and niece of Grammy-nominated singer Bobby Womack.
Vocal prowess aside, Legend praised Womack for her sincere emotional delivery.
“There’s something about soul that’s genre-less. And I actually couldn’t tell if you were a soul singer necessarily, but I could tell you were a soulful singer, which means something about it is authentic and true and passionate,” Legend said. “I was just feeling the drama and the energy you were emitting from the stage.”
Legend clearly made a soul connection with Womack, as she chose to join Team Legend.
“She has such a powerful, unique voice,” Legend said of Womack. “You can tell she feels a sense of purpose being on the stage, and I want to help her fulfill her purpose.”
Going against Team Legend comes with some bad karma.
The coaches unanimously turned their chairs for singer Brandon Montel, who stunned with his emotional cover of “Hard Place” by H.E.R. However, Legend found himself in a tough spot when McEntire hit her block button, preventing Legend from pitching to the Tennessee vocalist.
“Most of the time she’s a benevolent queen, but every once in a while she’ll do some ruthless, cold-blooded (and) dirty things,” Legend said. “If Reba messes up and there’s a steal opportunity, I will be first in line.”
McEntire had no regrets about pulling out all the stops for Montel, whose stage presence enchanted the country icon.
“You are so special. I don’t have anybody like you,” McEntire told Montel. “I knew you were a performer, so then when I turned around and I saw you I thought, ‘Oh, man. I am so glad I blocked John.’ ”
In a twist of fate, Montel went with Team Gwen. Stefani had gushed over the 29-year-old’s “gorgeous” and “original-sounding” performance.
“Niall blocked me. He did not win the artist he blocked me for,” Legend reflected. “Reba did not win the artist she blocked me for. So, the lesson is don’t block me. It’s going to backfire.”
For Nini Iris, sometimes reality is better than (fan)fiction.
The New York-based singer, who hails from the European country Georgia, brought the house down and earned a four-chair turn with her powerful performance of “I See Red” by Everybody Loves an Outlaw.
“That was the best vocal of the day without a shadow of a doubt,” Horan said, calling Iris’ performance “commanding.” “I think we’re looking at a potential winner here.”
Legend echoed Horan’s praise of the 27-year-old songstress. “It was fantastic to witness,” he told Iris. “You gave us a soulful rock performance.”
When asked by Stefani who her musical influences are, Iris revealed she was a big One Direction fan in her younger years, even writing fanfiction about the British boyband that featured Horan.
Iris brought her Directioner fantasy to life with her “Voice” victory. The singer chose to join Team Niall.
“John Legend was turning into the four-chair king,” Horan said. “But the four-chair prince is here now.”

Season points projections for the NHL are always difficult because of unexpected occurrences.
Last season, the Boston Bruins leaped from a 2021-22 wild card spot to the best record in league history. The New Jersey Devils and second-year Seattle Kraken made the playoffs with improvements of 40 points or more. Meanwhile, the Columbus Blue Jackets cratered after a ridiculous run of injuries.
This season is also tough to predict because seven of the eight teams in the Atlantic Division have the potential to make the playoffs. Three division teams made major acquisitions, one had major losses and two open the season with key players out.
Other wild cards: Patrick Kane plans to sign with a contender once he recovers from his hip surgery, and the bottom teams won't be as keen to shed talent because there isn't a generational draft pick available – as with Connor Bedard last season.
Here is our prediction on how NHL teams will finish this season (explainers are below the graphic):
NFL power rankings entering Week 6 of the 2023 season (previous rank in parentheses):
1. 49ers (1): What else is there to say about a team that's been in the top spot since the season started? S.F.’s +99 point differential is already 20 better than the next team. Probably have the best defense (though that can be settled at Cleveland on Sunday). Might have the best offense. Stars on basically every unit. And second-year QB Brock Purdy continues to effectively play mistake-free football, his league-leading 123.1 passer rating testament to that.
2. Eagles (3): They're 5-0 in successive seasons for the first time. Next up, the Jets – a team Philadelphia has never lost to in 12 previous meetings. Feels safe to slot the reigning NFC champs at 6-0 and look ahead to their Week 7 date with Miami.
3. Lions (5): For all the focus on rookie Jahmyr Gibbs, it's veteran RB David Montgomery who's fueled a ground game with more rushes than any team in the league save two. Sunday, Montgomery became the first Detroit rusher to top 100 yards in consecutive games since … Kevin Jones in 2004.
4. Chiefs (6): Here's a stat that might surprise you – RB Isiah Pacheco leads Kansas City with 424 yards from scrimmage, nearly double TE Travis Kelce's total (222).
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
5. Bills (2): Just as LB Von Miller returns from the PUP list following last year's knee injury, LB Matt Milano (leg) could be lost for the remainder of this season. Weird as this sounds, Milano might be the more valuable player to Buffalo's defense.
6. Dolphins (7): How fast is Miami? Per Next Gen Stats, the Fins have produced the five top speeds among all plays this season and seven of the top nine. WR Tyreek Hill and RBs De'Von Achane and Raheem Mostert are responsible for them (and WR Jaylen Waddle has also cracked the top 20). Big-play Achane is averaging a ridiculous 12.1 yards per carry and 115.0 rushing yards per game, both figures best in the NFL. But seems likely a knee injury will force veteran Jeff Wilson to spot Achane in the coming weeks.
7. Jaguars (14): The first team to play multiple international games in a season is now the first to win multiple – both coming against teams with winning records. Stay in Europe, Jags – it seems inevitable, and you're apparently better for it.
8. Cowboys (4): Good thing they're not part of the NFC West … even if it would make more sense geographically. In its two defeats (to Arizona and San Francisco), Dallas has lost by a collective 70-26. Worse, the Niners seemed to expose how limited the Mike McCarthy offense might actually be.
9. Steelers (12): They've gained the third-fewest yards in the league and surrendered the third most, the delta more than 600 yards. But 11 takeaways, 17 sacks and just enough clutch plays from QB Kenny Pickett can mask such warts … and propel you to the top of the AFC North.
10. Ravens (8): It's been an uneven start, to say the least, but it's also unusual to play four of five away from home so early in the season – and Baltimore's three-game roadie winds to a conclusion Sunday in London.
11. Rams (9): Sure, they're 2-3, but they've hung tough against the league's top teams, San Francisco and Philadelphia. Appears WRs Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua will complement each other nicely, each getting at least 11 targets Sunday, Kupp's 2023 debut.
12. Seahawks (10): Coming off their bye, they're currently not scheduled to face a team with a winning record until November. Time to make serious hay toward a playoff berth.
13. Browns (13): Semi-eventful bye week with GM Andrew Berry explaining QB Deshaun Watson's last-minute scratch in Cleveland's previous game while defending the trade of obviously capable veteran QB2 Josh Dobbs during preseason.
14. Buccaneers (16): This marks three times in four years that QB Baker Mayfield has won three of his first four starts. His only 4-1 beginning led to a deep playoff run in Cleveland.
15. Saints (20): Great sidebar to Sunday's 34-0 runaway in New England. TE Foster Moreau, a New Orleans native, scored his first TD with the Saints – and first since beating Hodgkin lymphoma during the offseason. Pretty cool story amid the NFL's annual "Crucial Catch" campaign for cancer screening.
16. Falcons (18): If you know anything about the NFL, and running backs in particular, best to appreciate their genius while you can. Thankfully, Bijan Robinson has been putting his on display week in and week out, Sunday's TD catch-and-run a thing of beauty.
17. Colts (17): QB2 Gardner Minshew II may be the league's best reliever, but Indianapolis surely didn't count on him playing 50% of the snaps to this point – a figure that's going to rise as Anthony Richardson's sprained throwing shoulder heals.
18. Texans (11): No matter Sunday's outcome, this will be their best six-game start since 2019. But it would help if Houston would run the ball better after cracking 90 yards just once so far this season.
19. Titans (21): WR DeAndre Hopkins' 100-yard day courtesy of Ryan Tannehill was the 11th time he's topped the century mark with a different quarterback. Get a C-note with two more passers, and Nuk sets a league record … so might be worthy lobbying for playing time for Malik Willis and rookie Will Levis.
20. Chargers (22): Did you know WR Keenan Allen owns the NFL record for most games – three – with at least 15 receptions? With wingman Mike Williams down for the count, wouldn't be a shock if Allen extends that mark before this year is out.
21. Jets (24): Only 12 games into his career, he hardly has enough totes to qualify – but if he did, Breece Hall's 6.3 yards per carry would be a record among RBs. Unfortunately, could be hard to sustain that with OL Alijah Vera-Tucker (Achilles) headed to injured reserve.
22. Bengals (26): They'll only be on the road two more times before December, so maybe the comforts of home are good for QB Joe Burrow's calf and team focus with a brutal upcoming schedule (Seattle, San Francisco, Buffalo) for a Cincinnati club that may finally otherwise be turning the corner.
23. Raiders (28): If they're going to salvage their season and use Monday's win as a catapult, now is the time. The Silver and Black face three one-win teams (Patriots, Bears, Giants) over the next four weeks.
24. Packers (19): No worse way to go into a bye week than off a terrible loss. But Green Bay's next three opponents (Broncos, Vikings, Rams) have a combined four wins, so hopefully a good time for the Pack to get healthy figuratively and literally.
25. Vikings (25): Why is offensive balance often a virtue? Consider one-win Minnesota, which has thrown more passes (204) than any team in the league while attempting the fewest runs (91). However that calculus might have to change with All-Pro Justin Jefferson's hamstring injury forcing him to IR.
26. Bears (32): The Justin Fields-to-DJ Moore Show has sparked Chicago's revival. But look closer, and you'll also note a running game averaging better than 170 yards the past two weeks and some encouraging signs of life on defense at Washington. The schedule also suggests Da Bears could easily be a .500 team from here on out.
27. Commanders (15): Only Denver has surrendered more points than Washington's 160. Only Minnesota has turned it over more times than Washington's 10. Lethal combo.
28. Broncos (29): Naturally, when you crown yourselves with dopey "snowcapped" helmets, another Rocky Mountain meltdown is completely inevitable.
29. Giants (30): S Jason Pinnock's 102-yard pick-six Sunday is the longest play of the season NFL-wide and provided Big Blue's first TD before halftime this season. Some consolation for a team that hasn't run an offensive play with the lead yet and has now been outscored by a league-most 91 points.
30. Cardinals (27): No NFC team is blitzing less frequently – worth wondering if that's the right approach given the way Arizona's D has been torn up the past two weeks.
31. Patriots (23): If the dynasty wasn't already dead, then life support has officially been unplugged. Bill Belichick wants to "start over" after suffering the two worst defeats of his career with an offense that's been shut out of the end zone for 10 consecutive quarters and has turned it over 10 times.
32. Panthers (31): The NFL's only winless team just turned it in its worst defensive performance (42 points allowed) of the season. Its reward? A trip to Miami. Woof.

Just when it seemed like Texas was back and a run at the College Football Playoff seemed in the offing, an impressive win by Oklahoma has changed the outlook of this week's bowl projections.
It might seem a simple plug-in for the Sooners to keep the Big 12 with representation in the field, however that's not the major adjustment this week. It's Washington that is moving up to the semifinals ahead of a showdown with Oregon, another potential contender for the vacancy created by the Longhorns. The Huskies with the nation's top offense and home field have the slight edge to get the win Saturday.
The advantage any potential champion from the Pac-12 has on the Big 12 is the strength of the league is significantly superior. Unless Oklahoma runs the table, it'd be expected that a one-loss team from the Pac-12 would get through, though that projection certainly could change with eight more weeks of games remaining.
Texas would have a decent argument if it can run through the rest of its game and beat an unblemished Sooners team in the Big 12 title. The Longhorns slip into the New Year's Six for now and are appropriately matched with Oregon. Oklahoma jumps up to the NY6 and a meeting with Ohio State.
Reminder: Some conferences may not fulfill their bowl allotment. Asterisks denote a replacement pick. James Madison is eligible for a bowl if there are not enough six-win teams to fill all the spots.
The NFL's second-leading rusher, Miami Dolphins rookie De'Von Achane, is expected to miss several weeks with a knee injury, according to published reports.
Both NFL Network and ESPN say the injury Achane suffered Sunday against the New York Giants is significant enough that he'll likely miss "multiple" weeks. If that's the case, the Dolphins could opt to put him on injured reserve, which would mean he'd be out a minimum of four games.
A third-round pick out of Texas A&M, the 5-9 Achane has been one of this season's breakout stars, rushing for 460 yards and five touchdowns on just 38 carries – a stellar average of 12.1 yards per rush. He also has a pair of receiving touchdowns in just four games.
Achane has been one of the key performers on a Dolphins offense that ranks first in the NFL in both rushing and passing yards per game.

Passengers on a British Airways flight from Barcelona to London were met by ambulances on the tarmac at Heathrow Airport on Sunday after travelers reported feeling unwell due to fumes in the cabin.
“The safety of our customers and crew is always our top priority. This aircraft landed normally at Heathrow following reports of a technical issue,” British Airways said in a statement. “Customers disembarked the aircraft safely via steps, and we’ve apologized to them for the delay and inconvenience caused to their journey.
The flight was British Airways 475, operated by a an Airbus A320.
Social media posts show travelers standing around with emergency vehicles and British Airways shuttle buses at the airport.
Fume incidents are not unheard-of in aviation, though they are rare and can sometimes be a health hazard. 
Travelers, and especially flight crews, can experience long-term adverse health impacts if certain toxins are released into the cabin, though the substances involved in the British Airways incident were not ultimately found to be hazardous. 
Cruising Altitude:Yes, you could inhale toxic fumes during your flight. Here's what to know.
Advocates in the U.S. and abroad are pushing for tighter standards around aircraft cabin air quality, and are encouraging the installation of monitoring equipment on commercial aircraft. Currently, no such standards or requirements exist in the U.S.

Cruise lines are adjusting operations amid the Israel-Hamas war – in some cases suspending calls altogether.
Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line and other brands have notified guests of itinerary changes for sailings in the region amid other disruptions to travel, including flights.
Airlines have issued waivers to passengers and the U.S. State Department has advisories in place for the region, encouraging travelers to exercise increased caution when visiting Israel and the West Bank and warning against travel to Gaza.
Here’s what cruise passengers should know.
▶ Celebrity Cruises: The line's Celebrity Apex ship is replacing visits to Israel and Egypt with stops in Santorini, Mykonos and Rhodes in Greece and Bodrum, Turkey, on its Oct. 6 and Oct. 16 sailings, a spokesperson for parent company Royal Caribbean Group said. The 10-day cruises sail round-trip from Piraeus, according to CruiseMapper.
▶ Holland America Line: The line’s Nieuw Statendam will replace a planned visit to Ashdod, Israel, with Alanya, Turkey, according to a spokesperson for the line. The ship will arrive early to planned stops in Limassol, Cyprus on Tuesday and Rhodes, Greece, on Wednesday, giving guests more time to explore.
The ship’s 28-day cruise from Rome to Athens had featured the line’s last stop in Israel for the year.
▶ Princess Cruises: Princess is not stopping in Israel at this time and is adjusting Island Princess’s “Mediterranean and Israel” sailings in November accordingly, a spokesperson said in an email.
“As soon as the itineraries have been updated we will send notifications to affected guests and their travel agents,” the spokesperson said.
▶ Norwegian Cruise Line: The line’s Norwegian Gem ship skipped a planned visit to Ashdod on Sunday, spending the day at sea instead, according to a spokesperson for the line. The ship continued to Limassol as scheduled Monday. The vessel is on an 11-day sailing from Rome to Istanbul, according to CruiseMapper.
Norwegian Jade will replace planned visits to Ashdod and Haifa on Wednesday and Thursday with stops in Bodrum on Tuesday and Marmaris on Wednesday. The ship, which is on a weeklong round-trip sailing from Athens, will spend a day at sea Thursday.
“We are closely monitoring the situation in Israel,” the spokesperson said. “As always, the safety and security of our guests, crew and communities we visit is our top priority. We have strict safety protocols in place and cooperate with local authorities regarding security matters at the destinations our ships visit.”
▶ Oceania Cruises: The line's Nautica ship left Israel on Saturday, one day ahead of schedule. All guests and crew members were safe and accounted for, a spokesperson for the line said. The line's Sirena vessel's planned stops in Haifa and Ashdod during its Oct. 14 voyage from Piraeus to Istanbul will be replaced by Santorini, Heraklion and Mykonos in Greece.
The line is also "in the process of reviewing itinerary options" for its Marina ship's Nov. 1 cruise, which is set to spend two days in Israel, the spokesperson said.
▶ Regent Seven Seas Cruises: “Due to the current escalated situation, we have decided the most prudent course of action is to amend Seven Seas Voyager’s October 3 and October 15, 2023, itineraries and replace the previously scheduled calls to Israel,” a spokesperson for the line said in an email.
The ship will skip its planned stop in Haifa on Oct. 14 and 15, instead sailing to Istanbul. The Oct. 15 sailing will begin in Istanbul rather than Haifa and sail directly to Cairo.

TEL AVIV, Israel – Before I hit the bike path for a long sightseeing excursion in this international hotspot, dressing down in muted colors, a nondescript baseball cap and a relatively cheap watch and shoes was as second nature to me as applying sunscreen.
As a longtime national security journalist who has traveled to some of the world’s grittiest corners, I learned long ago to make sure I’m that person who doesn’t stick out in a crowd and become a target for thieves, terrorists, or kidnappers – whether I’m on an assignment or a family vacation. 
Central Intelligence Agency operatives on assignment overseas call it “being the gray man” who blends in and doesn’t alert the world to their American citizenship and all of the assumed wealth and baggage that can bring. I learned about this valuable safety tip during many “Hostile Environment Training” courses I’ve taken over the decades, including some I helped design for young journalists flying off to destinations overseas.

I was already thinking of brushing up on my travel safety tips when preparing to come to Tel Aviv when I happened upon a new CIA web posting with advice from its officers on how to travel safely and with confidence. 
The CIA released these tips – or travel tradecraft, in spy parlance – as part of its ongoing effort to demystify its work in assisting the American public, according to agency spokesperson Walter Trosin.
I found the CIA's best practices, culled from the experience of its officers in the field, are exceptionally helpful, easy to adopt and especially relevant to Americans in these fraught times.
Here’s how to think like a spy on the ground overseas, with some annotation based on my travels as anything but an American James Bond:
▶ CIA tip: Make a paper and digital copy of your passport. While traveling abroad, it might literally be your ticket home if problems arise. If a hotel desk clerk asks to hold on to your passport, see if they’ll accept the paper copy. While you’re at it, write down some important phone numbers on the hard copy, including emergency contacts and the local U.S. embassy just in case.
Josh's tip: Email yourself the digital copy in case your phone goes missing along with your passport.
▶ CIA tip: Register with your embassy. Think of it as establishing communications with your home base. This enables embassy staff to contact you if there’s an emergency or unfolding crisis. U.S. citizens can also sign up with the State Department’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.
▶ CIA tip: Learn some local lingo. Bring a pocket guidebook or phone app so you can pick up key words and phrases.
Josh's tip: My go-to essentials include “thank you,” “please,” “hello,” “goodbye,” “yes/no,” “help,” “bathroom” and “police.” In worst-case scenarios, yelling out “no cash” helps if you believe you might be getting robbed, and “medic” and “hospital” if someone is hurt.
▶ CIA tip: Know your destination. Bone up not just on travel books but also try to get a sense of the place and the geopolitical issues at play there. The CIA World Factbook is very helpful and publicly available for basic information. The CIA's World Factbook team also has created special travel briefings for many countries.
Josh's tip: Look up the State Department Travel Advisories for your destination, though they often tend to be overly scary and alarmist.
▶ CIA tip: Scout out local transportation. Upon arrival, ask an airport official or travelers’ aide how much it should cost to catch a public shuttle or taxi to your hotel. Check online sites too. Be sure to negotiate the taxi price before loading your baggage and getting inside. Only use cabs from the official queue – or ride-hailing services from official apps – that are clearly marked and have a functioning meter and the driver’s ID displayed inside.
Josh's tip: Ask ahead of time if they take credit cards or American currency. Even better, stock up on the local currency, preferably at an ATM where you can use a credit card that gets you a better rate than the money changers at the airport.
▶ Josh's tip: Keep all your luggage close. This is especially the case when getting to and from your hotel. Bags can disappear at the luggage carousel, the taxi stand, hotel lobby, or any number of other places.
Story continues below.
▶ CIA tip: Know your escape route from your hotel room too. Familiarize yourself with emergency evacuation plans. And do a run-through to determine how many doors there are between your room and the nearest stairwell. Could you find it in the dark? While holding your breath in a smoky haze?
▶ CIA tip: Use the elevator, unless it’s an emergency. Using the stairs may be great for exercise, but crimes frequently occur in isolated stairwells.
▶ CIA tip: Try to reserve a room on a middle floor. Being on the ground floor can leave you vulnerable to break-ins, but many countries’ emergency response personnel aren’t equipped to reach higher than a few floors off the ground.
Josh's tip: If you’re in a particularly strife-torn locale, consider a room in the back of the hotel if you’re worried about car bombs or terrorist attacks. And just know that in some hotspots, bad actors will target hotel restaurants and other places where tourists congregate.
▶ CIA tip: Lock it up. Automatic locks on hotel room doors can often be forced open, and the chains cut. Use the deadbolt if there is one. Better yet, invest in a cheap and easily portable rubber doorstop; they work amazingly well.
▶ CIA tip: Beware of unsolicited knocks. Don’t open your hotel door unless you know or can verify who’s on the other side. Be especially wary of unrequested special delivery, maintenance calls, turndown service, or room service. Don’t be shy about calling the front desk to confirm.
▶ CIA tip: Lock it down. Whether renting a car or taking a taxi, lock the doors and keep the windows rolled up if you sense any danger – or crowds. Carjackers and snatch-and-grab thieves often prey on simple mistakes like an open door or window.
▶ Josh's tip: When using Uber, Lyft and many other ride-hailing apps, make sure you are getting into the correct car. If something feels wrong, don’t get in.
▶ CIA tip: Stay alert. CIA officers (the real term for overseas spies, not agents) are trained to be highly attuned to their surroundings to constantly maintain situational awareness. Use all five senses to pay attention to what’s happening around you, and you’ll not only spot telltale signs if something is amiss but retain more of your destination’s unique atmosphere.
Josh's tip: You don’t always need to sit with your back to the wall like Jason Bourne but being able to see the entrances – and know the exits – is important if you need to get out quick.
▶ CIA tip: Be mindful when drinking adult beverages. Spies might swill martinis in the movies, but alcohol impairs alertness and judgment and could put you at risk, especially in an unfamiliar country. Learn the local customs and restrictions on alcohol consumption and follow them closely.
Josh's tip: Make sure you can see your drinks being poured and transported to you to make sure no one is adding any intoxicants. Avoid using or purchasing recreational drugs even if locals insist they’re safe and legal.
▶ CIA tip: Walk the walk. Your confident demeanor on the street is often the best deterrent against criminals. Be the gray man or woman and you won’t look like an easy target. Don’t attract attention by looking confused, lost, or distracted. Avoid poring over maps and phone apps in busy areas. And don’t be flashy. Flaunting extravagant watches and other personal items or cash will attract thieves and opportunists.
▶ CIA tip: Plan your route and reroute as necessary. Whether traveling by foot, car, or public or private transit, prepare in advance. Bone up on the potentially dangerous parts of town so you can avoid them. Don’t walk alone at night, stick to well-lit areas that aren’t too isolated if you can and know the number of the local authorities just in case. Avoid crowd commotion, as it could mean escalating danger or even a distraction designed to help someone target you.
Josh's tip:  Carry an emergency whistle handy to scare off potential assailants.  
With these tips, I spent the day biking throughout Tel Aviv and the nearby port of old Jaffa, home to a vibrant multiethnic community of Muslims, Christians, and Jews. The city was on edge a bit due to a recent wave of terrorist attacks, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time chatting up the locals and sampling their food and drink knowing I was doing everything I could to stay safe.
U.S. airlines have suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants.
American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have also issued travel waivers allowing passengers scheduled to fly to and from Israel to rebook. United’s waiver also covers flights to and from Amman, Jordan.
“We continue to monitor the situation with safety and security top of mind and will adjust our operation as needed,” American said in a statement. 
Delta said it is suspending operations to and from Israel through Oct. 31.
"Our hearts are with those who are impacted as our people work to find safe alternatives for customers trying to depart TLV," a statement from the airline said. "Delta will continue to explore options for customers to safely exit TLV via seats that become available on our partner airlines."
Delta noted that flights to and from Tel Aviv on partner airlines like Virgin Atlantic should remain available and bookable on its website. It also noted some flights through Oct. 17 may inaccurately show up as operating on some platforms but emphasized that those flights are canceled.
United Airlines said its flights will remain suspended "until conditions allow them to resume."
If your flight was canceled by a U.S. airline, you are entitled to a full refund even if you bought a nonrefundable ticket, according to Department of Transportation regulations.
The State Department has also issued travel advisories for the region, urging increased caution for American citizens headed to Israel and the West Bank, and suggesting not to travel to Gaza.
“Terrorist groups, lone-wolf terrorists and other violent extremists continue plotting possible attacks in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza. Terrorists and violent extremists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities,” the advisory says. “Violence can occur in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza without warning. There has been a marked increase in demonstrations throughout Israel, some with little or no warning.”
The Federal Aviation Administration posted a notice to pilots in the region.
"Due to the ongoing conflict situation between Israel and Gaza, operators are advised to exercise extreme caution when operating within the Tel Aviv flight information region," the notice to air missions (NOTAM) issued Saturday said. "Flight crews should remain in contact with air traffic control at all times while operating within the (region)."
Many European and Asian airlines also suspended service to Tel Aviv. Israel’s national carrier, El Al, continues operating flights. 
Air France said it suspended services to Tel Aviv “until further notice” after coordinating with French and Israeli authorities.
Germany’s Lufthansa, which suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv until Saturday, said Monday that the decision regarding its planes and those of its subsidiaries was made “due to the still unclear developing security situation in Israel and after an intensive analysis of the situation.”
The Lufthansa Group includes Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Brussels Airlines as well as Lufthansa itself.

UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay.
Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports.
Their partnership should have been a force for good. Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.
The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.
Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.
But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.
According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.
“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”
In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”
“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”
Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.
The stakes are high for everyone.
Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.
Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.
Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.
Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.
“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”
USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.
Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.
For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.
Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.
For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.
“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”
Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.
Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.
At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.
By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.
Tucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.
Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline
Tucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.
Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.
Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.
Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.
During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.
They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.
In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”
It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.
Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.
Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.
They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.
Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.
By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.
Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.
Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”
Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.
Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.
Twelve days later came the call.
Tracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.
According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.
“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”
Tracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”
She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.
“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”
Tracy said she thought to herself, "Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it." In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”
When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.
Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.
Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.
At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.
Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.
When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.
Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.
Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”
Tucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.
The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.
Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.
She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.
Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.
“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”
The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.
A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.
Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.
Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.
Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.
Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.
Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.
“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.
Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.
Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.
Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.
Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.
They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.
“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”
Michigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.
The case would go forward.
Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22.
He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.
For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.
Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.
An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.
Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.
During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”
Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.
“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”
Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.
Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.
Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.
Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.
At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.
Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.
Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”
Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.
One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.
A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”
“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”

On a sunny Thursday morning, Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker strolled through tomato fields at a farm in Immokalee, Florida, toured its processing plants and loaded baskets of bright green fruit into a truck. 
It was a private event thrown by the school to promote its migrant student services program, which provides financial aid and support to farmworkers seeking college degrees. After the April 28, 2022, tour, disclosed in records obtained by USA TODAY this week, Tucker met with community leaders and alumni.
That night, Tucker would make the now-infamous phone call from his hotel room in nearby Naples, during which he is accused of masturbating and making unwanted sexual comments to Brenda Tracy, a prominent rape survivor and activist he had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence.
Yet, when Tucker met with the university’s outside investigator in March for his interview in the sexual harassment case against him, he insisted the trip was not work-related – a claim the investigator would disprove in her report.
It’s just one example of Tucker failing to keep his story straight at the most consequential moment of his career. 
With his job, reputation and the roughly $80 million left on his contract at stake, Tucker repeatedly made false statements to the investigator and misled her about basic facts, such as his location during the phone call and the date it occurred, a USA TODAY review of more than 1,200 pages of case documents found. 
The investigator, Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, and the news organization both obtained documents and witness statements that discredit key aspects of Tucker’s version of events. 
Michigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sept. 10, hours after Tracy went public for the first time with her story in USA TODAY. On Monday, the school informed Tucker it plans to fire him for cause based on the conduct he had admitted to and the embarrassment he had caused the school. 
Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivor
Although Tucker denied sexually harassing Tracy, he acknowledged masturbating on the call, saying he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex.” Tracy said Tucker’s romantic interest in her was completely one-sided and that she had tried to set boundaries multiple times during their yearlong business partnership.
Per his contract, Tucker has until Tuesday to make a case for keeping his job. Regardless, a formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated school policies against sexual harassment and exploitation is expected to proceed on Oct. 5 and 6. 
Since his suspension, Tucker has issued multiple public statements defending himself, attacking Tracy and accusing Veidlinger of bias. He accused the school of conducting a “sham” hearing and having “ulterior motives.” Yet even in these written statements, the central details of his story changed entirely.
Tucker, who previously hung up on a reporter who called him on his cellphone asking about the case, did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. His attorney, Jennifer Belveal, has not responded to phone calls and emails. Tracy declined to comment for this story.
In the absence of eyewitnesses or recordings, sexual harassment cases usually boil down to whose account is more credible, said Elizabeth Abdnour, a Lansing-based attorney and former Michigan State Title IX investigator who has taken part in dozens of campus cases.
“It’s very, very unusual that you would have some outside piece of evidence that would give you a clear decision,” Abdnour said. “Very often you’re weighing credibility based on little bits and pieces of information.” 
In multiple cases she has worked, Abdnour said the respondents lost because they were found to have a greater propensity for lying than the complainants. The hearing officer must determine how much weight to give Tucker’s false and conflicting statements, Abdnour said, and they could sway the case in Tracy’s favor.
“I believe a fact finder could assess these pieces of evidence about credibility and make a determination that Brenda is more credible than Mel,” she said. “In my experience, a clear sign of a lack of credibility is generally taken very seriously.”
By the time Tucker met with Veidlinger for his interview, he had had months to prepare.
The school had informed him of Tracy’s complaint on Dec. 22, the day after she filed it. Veidlinger had interviewed Tracy and all six of her witnesses by the end of January. Tucker was the only holdout.
Rather than tell his side of the story right away, Tucker and his attorney spent three months trying to stop the investigation, case documents show. They wrote legal arguments urging Michigan State to drop the case and twice approached Tracy’s attorney proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no, and the school pressed forward.
On March 22, the day of his interview, Tucker sent Veidlinger a seven-page written account of his interactions with Tracy and lists of their “currently existing” text message and call history, which he said his legal team had compiled. Only a handful of text messages remained; he and Tracy both told the investigator they had deleted their texts with each other in the months after the April 2022 phone call.
In his interview, which lasted 3 ½ hours, Tucker questioned whether Tracy had mixed up the date of the call. He said he recalled being at his home in East Lansing when it occurred, but his own records showed that he had been in Florida on April 28, attending a charity function that was “absolutely not a University-sponsored event.”
His seven-page account told a different story – that he had called her while he was “alone in a hotel room.”
Veidlinger does not appear to have asked Tucker about the discrepancy, based on case documents. But by then she knew what he told her in the interview was untrue: she had already obtained records proving he had not been home in East Lansing.
An expense report he had submitted to the university for reimbursement of his hotel and meals shows Tucker flew to Naples, Florida, to attend a golf fundraiser hosted by The Greg H. Montgomery Jr. Foundation for Ultimate Growth, which raises awareness for suicide prevention. It showed he stayed at the Hilton from April 27 to 29, that the trip’s purpose was “administrative” and that it did not involve personal travel. He had flown there on a donor’s private plane.
The trip is when Tucker toured the farm in Immokalee to help promote Michigan State’s College Assistance Migrant Program. The event was titled “Working to make dreams a reality,” according to an agenda obtained from the university by USA TODAY through a public records request. The agenda features Tucker’s name prominently. Tucker posted photos from the tour on his Twitter account.
That Tucker was on a university-sponsored work trip during the incident was a contributing factor in the university’s determination that it had jurisdiction to investigate, the investigation report shows. 
Tucker’s lists of calls and text messages also were missing an important detail: They did not show any communication with Tracy on April 28. He acknowledged in the interview, however, that he had not reviewed the lists before submitting them and that they may have been incomplete.
Tracy, meanwhile, had already provided Veidlinger with her official cellphone records from Sprint that confirmed the date of their call: April 28.
Tucker and Tracy did not speak in the three months after the April 28 call.
Meanwhile, their assistants were planning Tracy’s third visit to campus – an in-person training with coaches and players scheduled for July 25.
Tucker canceled that training three days before, the investigation report shows. When Tracy spoke to him by phone on Aug. 2 seeking to find out why, she would tell the investigator in her interview that Tucker insinuated he would harm her career if she spoke about his conduct. He never rescheduled her visit, and they never spoke again.
The cancellation became a key focus of the investigator – one of a series of alleged incidents that taken together would meet the definition of sexual harassment, which can include pressuring someone into engaging in sexual behavior for an employment benefit and threatening that rejecting such behavior will carry a negative consequence.
“Reported allegations that a University employee is engaging in misconduct within the vendor-vendee relationship for which they are the decision-maker, and/or impeding in such a services relationship based on a quid-pro-quo sexual harassment allegation, is within a University sponsored program or activity,” Veidlinger wrote in the report, so school policy covered it.
Tucker tried to distance himself from the cancellation in a public statement on Sept. 11, the day after Michigan State suspended him without pay.
“I never cancelled any presentation,” he wrote. “Given a personnel change and scheduling challenges as football season approached, we merely postponed it until January 2023. She chose to file her complaint instead of proceeding with the training.”
But that statement contradicts what he told the investigator. When Veidlinger asked in his March interview if he had a role in canceling Tracy’s visit, Tucker said, “Yes, absolutely I did,” the report shows, and that he did not recall any discussions about rescheduling Tracy for January. Such timing would not make sense, he added, because most of his new players would not yet be on campus. 
Tucker also told the investigator why he canceled the visit, blaming it on a scheduling conflict. He said he had recently hired a mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, who needed to implement his new program on short notice. There was limited time in fall camp, Tucker said, and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” the players. He said he decided to yield the time to Newman.
Veidlinger, however, would later obtain records showing Newman did not meet with the team on July 25, the day of Tracy’s planned visit. He had been meeting with them weekly since June 6, the records showed but held no meetings between July 15 and July 28.
One of Tucker’s assistants, who is a witness in the case, also told the investigator that Tucker asked him via text message to cancel it. He said he was never instructed to reschedule. 
In his interview, Tucker told Veidlinger that his relationship with Tracy frayed after the April 2022 phone call – not because of the incident, but because of information he learned after that caused him not to trust her.
According to Tucker, an associate of his had told him over the summer that Tracy’s assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, had been gossiping about Tucker’s marriage, telling others it was “on the rocks.” Tucker said he was “devastated” because he had confided in Tracy about his marital problems, and he believed she had discussed them with Alvarado.
Tucker confronted Tracy about the alleged gossiping during the Aug. 2 phone call, they both told the investigator. Tracy said he berated and bullied her, repeatedly saying he could not trust her. She said she told him she did not know what he was talking about.
Alvarado – who was killed in a car crash in June – would deny discussing Tucker’s marriage with anyone in her January interview with Veidlinger. 
During the Aug. 2 call, Tracy said she pressed Tucker to identify his source – the associate. She told Veidlinger she believed Tucker had made it up as a pretext for canceling her visit and ending her relationship with the school.
Veidlinger also asked Tucker to reveal the source of his claim, but he refused to say. In her report, she wrote that he said he had “given (his) word that (he) wouldn’t divulge their name.” 
Tucker never revealed the associate’s name to the investigator, nor did he identify anyone who could support his version of events. In his Sept. 11 public statement, however, he lamented that the hearing would not afford him the opportunity to “offer any substantive evidence of innocence.”
It was not the only claim he attributed to his anonymous associate. In his interview, he said that same person told him that ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating how Tracy “goes about her business” by claiming to be a rape survivor.  
Tucker said this further caused him to believe Tracy was untrustworthy because she believed Lavigne was her friend but didn’t know she was investigating the rape story at the center of her public persona. 
It turned out to be yet another falsehood.
Reached by USA TODAY, Lavigne said in an emailed statement that she was “perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.” She said Tracy has been a source of information for her for several years, and that she has featured Tracy’s comments and advocacy work in multiple news stories.
“That has been the extent of my reporting on Tracy and her organization,” Lavigne wrote. “Neither the organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting.”
Asked who might have told Tucker this misinformation, Lavigne responded, “I have absolutely no idea who would have alleged this to anyone.”

The bullets came in plywood crates. 
Any given box was about the size of a small microwave oven. The printed label stuck to each one demonstrated a militaristic brevity. “CARTRIDGES FOR WEAPONS, INERT PROJECTILE,” next to a bright yellow hazmat sticker, “EXPLOSIVES.” 
Inside the boxes: drab green steel cans of .50-caliber ammunition. Each round was giant, more than 5 inches long, built to be fired from a gun so big it is typically bolted to a truck. The bullets were clipped together in long strands for rapid, machine-gun fire. 
By the time Bill Brown got to the boxes, they sat double-stacked eight high atop wooden pallets inside a Missouri warehouse. The pallets went on, row after row. Three million bullets in all. 
It was enough ammunition to feed a single machine gun – if fired nonstop at its rated speed eight hours a day, seven days a week – for almost six months. 
Brown’s job was to get it out of there and toward the Ukrainian front lines. The faster, the better. 
“War is bad,” Brown said. “Loss of life is bad. But at the end of the day, it’s very profitable and injects revenue into this military industrial base.”
There would be virtually no public record of this Ukrainian arms shipment. As a weapons dealer, Brown’s company would deliver the bullets under a system known as a direct commercial sale. The ammunition required a State Department signoff – but the secret deal would never appear in a White House announcement or the Congressional Record. 
Instead, it was part of a shadowy system of brokers, exporters, arms dealers and country-to-country transfers that has become one part of the race to meet demand on distant battlefields. 
Western weaponry fueled Ukraine’s summertime counteroffensive along a 600-mile front. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the effort was delayed in part by the wait for more arms. Amid concerns about that slowly progessing counteroffensive, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday with a promise of up to $175 million more in military equipment. 
Most of America’s $44 billion in documented support to Ukraine came in the form of old U.S. military stock, donated directly by the federal government. In general, commercial sales over $14 million, and sales of military-grade weaponry like mortars or missiles, require State Department approval and congressional notification.
But other aid comes via private sales. 
More than 14,000 U.S. entities are registered to conduct defense trade activities. Their deals are monitored by an alphabet soup of agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Trade secrecy clauses in federal law mean this flow of gear, weapons and ammunition is almost never revealed to the public.
Brown, who works for a small Nevada-based logistics company called Battle Born Munitions, provided USA TODAY with a rare look behind the curtain of these private sales. Details about the shipment were verified by his employer and the European government that made the purchase. State Department officials declined to answer questions about the specific shipment Brown described.
This March sale and the secret number of other shipments like it fuel Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion. Those sales also release an unknown amount of weaponry into the world. What becomes of that weaponry after it’s sold – and especially after it’s delivered – is difficult to track. 
As Brown surveyed the warehouse in Missouri, a crew steered forklifts and skid lifts among the stacks of plain wooden boxes. From high in the trusses, suspended lamp fixtures bathed the boxes in artificial daylight. Brown lifted his camera and started snapping photos. 
In just a few hours, he and his cargo would be boarding a jumbo jet. Three million bullets would climb to the stratosphere and hurtle across the north Atlantic toward a European dawn.
From Ukraine:War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented. So is the country's push for swift justice.
The bullets had once been bound for Saudi Arabia. 
Lot number SMQ19K401L026 had rolled off the assembly line in 2019 at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Kansas City. Lake City, owned by the government and run by a contractor, sprawls across nearly 4,000 acres of green Missouri farmland. Roads curve past World War II-era bunkers known as igloos, spaced out amid the countryside – far enough apart that an explosion in one won’t trigger a chain reaction in the others.
Lake City has been pumping out ammunition almost without pause since 1941. It is the largest small-arms manufacturing plant in the world.
Today the plant is run by Olin-Winchester, but in 2019, the bullets were made by some of the 1,700 workers employed by Northrop Grumman. And in 2019, Saudi Arabia was stocking up on weapons during the Trump administration, fueling the war in Yemen and other conflicts that drew criticism from congressional Democrats.
The plant manufactures .50-caliber ammunition on a rolling basis, for both military and commercial buyers. That’s a testament to just what a legend the bullet – and the gun that shoots it – has become.
In 2019, the technology was already a century old. The .50 caliber was the brainchild of American gunsmith John Browning during World War I. Built to respond to German anti-tank rifles, the M2 was first tested in 1918, and it entered widespread service in 1923. It earned the nickname “Ma Deuce” and has served in combat ever since, bolted to trucks, ships, planes and handheld stands on the battlefield.
The .50-caliber rounds – named for their diameter, about half an inch – can easily hit targets more than a mile away. At closer ranges, they will blast through solid concrete or armored vehicles. The gun can fire at a sustained rate of about 40 shots per minute.
Military setups use strings of “linked” ammunition to feed into machine guns. Spaced out after every fourth bullet, so-called tracer rounds have small pyrotechnic charges that illuminate the line of fire, aiding in targeting.
The gun’s longevity and versatility made it popular for militaries the world over. But this particular batch of bullets wouldn’t end up being sold to Saudi Arabia. 
The Biden administration put a temporary freeze on sales to the Saudi government in 2021 as it reviewed weapons deals approved under Donald Trump. Instead, Brown said, the bullets were sold to a U.S. ammunition provider, only to be held up again. Ultimately, they were mothballed. 
Then, in spring 2023, the bullets found a buyer, or actually two: first Battle Born; ultimately, the Netherlands. 
The European country, a NATO ally, needed a big supply of ammunition. It wouldn’t be keeping the bullets but giving them to Ukraine. Its purchase, essentially a donation, would count toward the country’s required NATO contribution. 
Brown had a line on exactly what they needed. It was sitting in the warehouse in Missouri. 
He arrived in March to personally oversee the shipment. As he prepped for delivery, Brown dropped tiny black tracking devices onto several of the pallets. Just $55 apiece, the units use GPS and cell signals to keep tabs on the load. The idea was to ensure it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands. 
But packing up the bullets was just the beginning. As with anything that’s deadly and made of metal, the shipping costs can be extreme. 
Brown said the question for the buyer was simple: “How fast do you want it? Forty-five to 60 days on a ship? Or in five days if I fly it?”
Brown – or Chief Bill, as he prefers – is a no-nonsense 35-year veteran of the U.S. Army and former helicopter pilot. He retired as a chief warrant officer and lives in Orlando. 
Now 59, he still spends a lot of time on the road – 10 international trips this year. He says his arms logistics work takes him to places most Americans would rather avoid – near the Syrian border or to unstable regions of Iraq.
He’ll travel halfway around the world, he quips, “have some soup, and go back to Warsaw to head home.” The trips aren’t really about the destinations. They’re about the cargo. 
On that spring day in Missouri, forklifts carefully loaded 107 pallets of the ammo onto 18 flatbed semitrailers. They’d all make the eight-hour drive to O’Hare International Airport. 
In Chicago, two Boeing 747-400s operated by National Airlines would be ready for the freight. 
Four pallets each were stacked and shrink-wrapped to create “air pallets” or “cookie sheets” weighing 12,800 pounds. Each plane could carry up to 17 of the pallets that ran the length of each plane secured by white cargo netting.
Flight records Brown provided show the two planes departed about seven hours apart, one in early afternoon, one after dark. 
The flight would take nine hours. Brown wasn’t going to the Netherlands, even though it was the buyer. The planes were bound for Rzeszów, Poland. 
The ancient city sits at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland. It has a gleaming modern airport next to a major east-west freeway. From there, it’s barely 60 miles to the border with Ukraine. 
It was an expensive journey. The trucking company’s bill for those 18 semis? $85,000. Chartering the two 747s? $625,000. Each.
But this shipment of .50-cal rounds was profitable for Battle Born Munitions, according to Brown.
The company purchased the 3 million rounds from Northrop Grumman at a bargain and resold them for more than double the price. (In subsequent interviews, representatives at BBM disputed the specific totals Brown mentioned, saying the accurate figures were protected by “various commercial and government non-disclosure agreements.” They did not dispute the other specifics of the deal he provided.) 
Retail prices for .50-caliber ammunition run roughly $5 per bullet. At that rate, the whole shipment would have been worth $15 million.
The pricing might also be elastic. The Dutch mark up the price of the bullets and count it toward their NATO contribution, pegged to a percentage of gross domestic product, Brown said. The Netherlands has contributed about $15 billion to NATO this year, or about 1.7% of its GDP and just under the NATO mandate of 2%.
Representatives of the Dutch military confirmed the shipment to USA TODAY but declined to comment further about the pricing or details.
The war in Ukraine has only increased the demand for private deals. The State Department signed off on more than $154 billion in commercial arms deals directly to foreign countries in 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year. 
Direct commercial sales represent a modest portion of the contribution to Ukraine compared with the $44 billion donated by the U.S., but they still amounted to more than $600 million in sales from U.S. companies to the Ukrainian government last year alone. That doesn’t include sales to other countries that also support Ukraine – sales like the one Brown described.
Jim Bartlett, an attorney with expertise in the specialized international arms transactions, said private U.S. businesses are playing a small but important role in the conflict.
“American companies are happy to export defense articles to foreign buyers approved by the U.S. State Department,” Bartlett said. “There’s an effort at the State Department to quickly clear the ones headed for Ukraine. … You get head-of-the-line privileges.”
Those sales also come with risks. 
Direct sales face fewer regulatory controls, oversight and enforcement, said Robert Nichols, an international military sales expert and attorney at the law firm Nichols Liu.
“You can imagine the range of characters involved in supplying a war effort,” Nichols said. “Some are highly credible. Others will skirt the law and sometimes step over the line by paying bribes, committing fraud and hiding their transactions.” 
So far, the Department of Justice has indicted just a handful of arms brokers over deals related to the war in Ukraine. Court records show the government has charged Miami-based Oleg Patsulya and Vasilii Besedin with illegally attempting to sell American-made aircraft parts to Russia. They allegedly lied to Commerce Department agents and told them the parts were bound for Turkey. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges this summer. 
A State Department spokesman declined to provide details of enforcement actions but said, “The United States takes seriously our responsibility to protect American military and dual-use technologies and prevent their diversion, including through strong enforcement actions.”
NATO said it oversees allied arms deliveries, and that those arms generally reach Ukraine. NATO itself technically only provides non-non-lethal aid, like fuel, medical supplies and generators.
Brown, of Battle Born, says he fields calls weekly from “clowns” without the proper licensing, whom he reports to the State Department for potential violations. Some raise red flags when they approach him about transactions that include payment via diamonds or gold.
He prefers traditional wire transfers with approved sales partners since he knows government officials are watching. He validates the contracts and checks certificates for the final users. That’s part of why he traveled with the ammunition. He would be meeting a Dutch military official for the official handoff.
“My job is to keep us all out of jail,” Brown said. 
The two 747s touched down in Poland, one before the sun, the other in late morning. Brown exchanged paperwork with a young Dutch military staffer who signed for the delivery, he said. They traded military patches as souvenirs. They snapped a photo together. 
The bullets bought by the Netherlands would never touch Dutch soil. 
U.S. aid:Billions from the US flows to Ukraine. Here's where it comes from, and how it adds up
Despite playing a small role proportionately in the war, $600 million in direct commercial sales can buy a lot of small weaponry. 
And those weapons are the kind most apt to fall into illicit use, said Elias Yousif, a research analyst at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit think tank.
Put another way: It’s hard to sneak away an F-16 or a missile launcher the size of a tractor-trailer. But a bunch of guns or a pallet of ammo? Much easier to resell. 
“In the commercial sector, especially in a new market, the risk increases,” Yousif said.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss arms research project, estimated that within a year, battlefield seizures and other forms of diversion led to 300,000 small arms and light weapons going missing, including 100,000 in Crimea alone.
When small arms go missing, they can go missing into another country, maybe one led by a despot or even a terrorist organization.
The U.S. government says diversion of American donations has been widely absent so far in Ukraine. That could be a combination of intensive “end-use-monitoring” programs and the reality of the battlefield, where supplies are rapidly put to use.
But even if not now, unused ammo could be resold someday. 
“History shows us this isn’t a short-term issue,” Yousif said.  “These are commodities with very long shelf lives.” 
Florida-based Global Ordnance, another State Department-licensed exporter, is a competitor in the direct weapons sales business. General counsel Bryan Van Brunt said the company has extensive protocols in place to track shipments and make sure the end-users are federally approved, though he declined to provide specifics about those systems. 
Brown, with Battle Born Munitions, says the company employs a mix of simple and sophisticated tracking technology to ensure his shipments are tracked to end users. The black GPS devices he dropped onto his cargo tracked the ammo all the way across the globe.
But that system only works as long as Brown is actually tracking. “Technically, my role ends when I deliver it to NATO,” he said.
Sometime after the 747s touched down in Poland, along with signing the paperwork and snapping a selfie with the Dutch official, Brown found the tiny black GPS trackers and lifted them off the pallets. 
Ukrainian trucks would arrive at the airport to pick up the ammunition. They would point toward the border, and onward to Lviv, and some distant battlefield. 
Brown would point in the opposite direction. Just like one of his quips: Fly in, have soup, get home. He headed toward Warsaw, with the GPS trackers in his bag.

The geography professor didn’t hide his clown fetish or the fact that he sometimes indulged his urges by recruiting students as subjects. He posted regularly about it on social media.
“I have a facepaint fetish and convince the cute girls in my classes to let me paint their faces,” he once wrote.
Yet Joseph Tokosh held jobs at two colleges and was on the tenure track at a third before student journalists at Nicholls State University in Louisiana exposed his behavior. He submitted his resignation the same day their story was published.
His interactions with students and open discussion of his fetish happened in both mainstream and tailored digital spaces. He popped into Facebook groups geared toward new students and niche forums on websites like Reddit. He posted videos on YouTube. In one Reddit post on a forum meant to highlight hard-to-believe stories, Tokosh posted pictures of several women in white face paint.
Over the years, two students reported him to campus police; others complained online. He left Kent State University after pleading no contest to something different: a theft charge that involved entering his peers’ offices without permission and taking a USB drive. Tokosh has not been charged with any other crime.
Tokosh’s career trajectory exposes inadequacies in the background check system that colleges and universities are supposed to have in place to protect students – especially when evidence of the concerning behavior resides largely on the internet. Nicholls State, for example, told USA TODAY Network reporters it does not routinely check social media for new hires.
A federal law intended to ensure the academic privacy of students also makes it difficult to determine how Tokosh was able to move so freely from campus to campus. Both Kent State and Northern Illinois University – where he taught while finishing his doctorate – noted Tokosh’s protected status as a graduate student in declining to answer questions.
Sophie Levan was a freshman at Kent State in 2017 when she encountered Tokosh, then 28, in a Facebook group intended as a gathering place for new students. Tokosh had offered cash to anyone willing to let him paint their faces. Levan, then 18, agreed.
The money was appealing but the interactions soured. 
Tokosh, she said, insisted he come pick her up and take her to the building that housed the geography department, where he would paint her face. Uneasy, Levan stopped responding. Tokosh got angry and wouldn’t give up, she said, which led her to file a police report.
“I felt like the school would want to know about it,” Levan said. “I thought maybe they could prevent anything bad from happening since other girls would go with him.”
She said there was never any followup from campus police – or anyone else.
USA TODAY Network reporters reviewed the experiences of six students who were the subject of Tokosh’s attention going back to his time at Kent State.
In addition to Levan, the other person who reported Tokosh to campus police could not be reached for comment. The two who expressed public concerns on social media told USA TODAY they never heard from their campus officials either.
USA TODAY attempted to reach Tokosh via phone, social media and a certified letter. A person answered a phone call to a number associated with Tokosh, but he hung up after the reporter identified himself. A reporter also reached someone who identified herself as Tokosh’s mother. She said she would pass along that reporters were trying to reach him.
Tokosh told the Nicholls student journalists that he did have an assignment where students were required to paint their faces as part of a cultural exercise. Prior to the article in the student newspaper The Nicholls Worth, the university had already cut Tokosh loose. He said his contract was not renewed because he was the target of a “grade inflation task force.”
The university, however, “does not have any such task force,” according to Nicholls spokesman Jerad David.
Tokosh also told students the face painting was a requirement in his cultural geography class to better understand other cultures. In a video interview with Hannah Robert, the station manager for the student-run KNSU TV, he says: “That's an assignment in one of my classes where they actually come up with their own face paint and makeup design inspired by a culture and they implement it.”
It’s a well-established trend in the academic world for professors to bounce from one institution to another without having to disclose why they left their last post, said Julie Libarkin, an associate dean at Michigan State University. She has seen the pattern often in her work maintaining a database of publicly documented sexual misconduct by faculty and staff.
As for grad students? Libarkin said people have requested she add them to her list, but universities’ conservative interpretations of the law get in the way.
“I don’t on purpose,” she said, “because that’s information that almost never comes out.”
Tokosh arrived at Kent State in 2015 with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in geography from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, according to his curriculum vitae. He was working toward his doctorate and researched fading businesses. His work about shopping malls in the Rust Belt won several awards. Like many graduate students, he also taught classes.
Then, Tokosh started showing up in the Facebook groups for new students. In a December 2017 post, an account under the name “Joe Tokosh” posted several pictures of women made up to look like clowns or skulls.
“If anyone is looking for some extra cash, I am looking for people to practice facepainting on!” he wrote. “I will literally pay you!”
Those are the types of posts that caught Levan’s eye. Not only was she pressed for cash, she was interested in movie makeup and thought the face painting could be fun based on the photos Tokosh had posted. But Levan said she soon realized that those images were stock photos and not representative of what Tokosh could do.
What’s more, she figured out that he was a graduate student, a fact she said he didn’t disclose in his posts.
When Tokosh offered to pick her up from her dorm, she refused. But, she said, Tokosh kept insisting she agreed to participate. Levan stopped responding to his messages and filed a police report with the Kent State police in January 2018. They advised her only to stop talking to Tokosh, she said, and let them know if “anything of consequence occurred.”
Months after she refused to meet up and filed the police report, Tokosh texted a picture of himself wearing white face paint to her cellphone. It arrived at midnight and contained no message, although writing on his shirt read: “I'm not a failure.”  
“There was some negative intention with sending that photo,” Levan said. “It’s definitely burned into my mind.”
What Levan didn’t know is that campus police had been put on notice a year earlier when another student filed a similar report. That student told police Tokosh reached out to her and her friends after they posted their numbers on a Facebook group for undergraduates. He would send “get to know you” messages, the police report said, and then ask the student if she was “interested in having her face painted for one of his class projects.”
When she found out Tokosh was a graduate student, she said no and eventually blocked him on Facebook and Snapchat, according to the report. Tokosh continued to text her.
“She does not have any concerns for her safety, but just wanted this documented,” the police report read. 
In July 2017, another student had retweeted a message from Kent State’s Twitter account that asked for Kent State love stories. She wrote: “A geography professor requested me on facebook and asked if he could paint my face like a clown.”
The student confirmed to USA TODAY that the professor was Tokosh and shared a screenshot of a Facebook friend request he sent her. She said she suspected Tokosh also found her on a freshman Facebook group because she posted there often.
She said she tweeted to draw officials’ attention to it and moved on but now wishes she had reported it officially.
College campuses are supposed to offer students special protections from sexual harassment even when it falls short of criminal behavior. Title IX, often associated with equity in women’s sports, also addresses “sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence” at schools that receive federal funding.
Colleges infrequently and unevenly enforce the rule, however. A 2022 USA TODAY investigation found just one of every 12,400 students was suspended in connection with sexual misconduct.
The student who shared her story online said the only response she received was from a graduate student in the geography department, who contacted her on Oct. 1, 2018. In an email, he wrote that he had seen her post and suspected he knew which faculty member had asked her about face painting.
“I brought it to the attention of some of our faculty because I was pretty sure I knew who it was, but they were certain it wasn’t that individual and that you probably just meant geology,” he wrote. 
He went on to reference another student being “approached in (at least by just looking at your tweet) a much more aggressive way.” The grad student asked the undergraduate for more information, but, she told USA TODAY, she didn’t respond. She said she started drafting a reply, but a year had passed. She wanted to move on.
Kent State would not say whether any actions were taken after the students’ reports, but Eric Mansfield, a spokesman for the university, said the police department confirmed that the students who filed police reports were provided with “university resources, which would include other non-criminal avenues to pursue (Counseling Services, Title IX, Center for Sexual and Relationship Violence Services, etc.) as a general police practice.”
Levan does not recall police offering her services, but she said she didn’t want counseling. She wanted Tokosh investigated.
Mansfield also said that the university monitors social media but that colleges “can’t always see or track every mention on social media.”
Police records show that officers did investigate when Tokosh was accused of breaking into geography department offices. A blotter item in the local newspaper shows police obtained an arrest warrant in connection with a third-degree felony burglary charge. Court documents indicate Tokosh pleaded no contest to a theft on Oct. 19, 2018.
Kent State would not explain what led to Tokosh’s departure during that fall semester. Instead, the university said that since Tokosh was a graduate student, any information about him was protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It also would not say whether school officials shared Tokosh’s disciplinary record with other colleges or even if it was standard practice to do so for grad students.
“Due to FERPA, student education records are private,” said Emily Vincent, a university spokeswoman. “Also, we do not comment on personnel matters.”
When Congress passed FERPA in 1974, its author, Sen. James L. Buckley of New York, said the intent was to protect the academic privacy of students and their families. In more recent years, Buckley has become critical of the law and how schools interpret it. He told the Columbus Dispatch in 2010 that “the law needs to be revamped.”
Survivors of sexual violence and students accuse universities of using the law to avoid negative media coverage. Students with a history of bad behavior may jump from one school to another without the public ever knowing about their histories. Law enforcement records don’t fall under FERPA’s purview, but a wide variety of questionable behavior does.
One case involved Brandon Austin, who was accused of sexual assault at Providence College in 2013 while on the school’s basketball team. But Providence College initially said Austin was suspended for violating the school’s code of student conduct and declined to share further details with the Providence Journal, citing federal privacy laws. Austin denied wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime. 
Austin was able to transfer to the University of Oregon, where he was again accused of sexual assault, along with other players. Police investigated the claims, and the local district attorney declined to press charges. The university expelled him anyway but raised FERPA when it declined to release records showing what Oregon knew about the allegations, according to the Oregonian.
LeRoy Rooker was the director of the U.S. Education Department office that oversaw FERPA for more than two decades. Rooker, now a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said FERPA is not a confidentiality law – it is focused on education records. And it doesn’t apply when a student is “seeking or intending to enroll” at another college.
Therefore, Rooker said, Kent State could have shared information about Tokosh with Northern Illinois.
Rooker also said FERPA would not have prevented Kent State from telling reporters if other universities had inquired about Tokosh, though they could not have disclosed what they shared.
He blamed the overuse of the law on fear of being sued.
“In this litigious age, institutions get a little wonky about whether they will forward, say, disciplinary records,” Rooker said. “On the other hand, if you have something and you don’t share it when you can and something happens at the next institution, I would say that’s a big liability.”
Backgrounding job applicants has become increasingly complex.
While most U.S. employers conduct background screening, according to trade group data, those inquiries typically focus on criminal history. Social media receives far less attention even though that is where people are most likely to share their unguarded thoughts.
Undertaking a full review of a person’s social media presence is more difficult than just checking an applicant’s Facebook page.
Does an applicant have an account on X, formerly Twitter? How about an account with Discord, an online platform frequented by gamers, where leaked Pentagon documents were recently shared? Or what about a Telegram account, a messaging platform popular among white nationalists? Further complicating things, it’s common on sites like Reddit for users to adopt usernames and describe experiences with little to no ties to reality.
A little digging, however, can turn up a lot of dirt.  
Tokosh has a LinkedIn page that includes his teaching stints at Northern Illinois University and Nicholls State University. His time as a student and instructor at Kent State is absent.
For LinkedIn, a custom URL includes a play on his name and his chosen field of study: Joeography. Tokosh would later use that moniker in promotional materials for a class at Nicholls State. That is the same handle used on Reddit by someone with a special interest in face paint.
One post features a video of Tokosh throwing a pie at someone. Other posts mention a “clown fetish.” In a forum titled “Creepy,” he wrote, “I convince pretty girls to let me paint their faces,” along with a photo with multiple women in white face paint.
That and other similar posts remained live for years until they were taken down after the Nicholls students published their story in late March.
USA TODAY Network reporters captured screenshots before they disappeared. With dates in 2019, the posts feature a young woman wearing a Kent State T-shirt. The material would have been available to administrators at Northern Illinois before the start of the fall 2019 semester.
Joe King, a spokesman for Northern Illinois, said departments hiring new graduate students are “not required to check social media or investigate a disciplinary history.” He added some departments may reach out to the graduate students’ former advisers.
King said he could not determine if the university was aware of Tokosh’s behavior at Kent State. He said that due to FERPA, he could not share specifics about Tokosh’s time at Northern Illinois, including whether students had complained about him.
But there are signs the behavior continued.
A YouTube account under the name “Joe Tokosh” included at least two videos in 2020 of a man throwing pies at women. One of the videos features a young woman also seen in the screenshots from Tokosh’s Reddit account. 
Comments on one from October 2020 read: “You can have a video of her tied up getting pied via cash app.” That video was viewed more than 30,000 times before it was turned off in late July, around the time a USA TODAY reporter reached out to Tokosh.
A former Northern Illinois State student shared text messages exchanged with Tokosh in which he asked to paint her face on multiple occasions. USA TODAY has agreed not to name her because she is concerned Tokosh might retaliate against her.
In the text messages, Tokosh shared a photo of a young woman in white face paint – an image also posted to the Joeography Reddit account. She said she declined to do it but was aware that other Northern Illinois students had participated.
By fall 2022, when he had moved on to Nicholls, Tokosh revealed to the student that he had required students in his cultural geography class to paint their faces.  
The Northern Illinois student asked Tokosh what he did with the photos, and she said he suggested that he might spin them off into a research project someday. She asked, had anyone complained? She said Tokosh responded: Why would they?
Many students would find a reason to complain, as Nicholls State student journalist Sally-Anne Torres learned firsthand. It started in January when one of her fellow reporters picked up an odd rumor: a professor was offering extra credit for students willing to paint their faces like clowns. Initially, Torres dismissed it because it seemed too unusual and there weren’t a lot of leads to follow. 
By Feb. 7, university administrators informed Tokosh that his contract would not be renewed, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY via a records request. They gave no reason for the nonrenewal, but on Feb. 12, Tokosh emailed his students that the university was letting him go. He blamed his departure on giving too many A’s.
That seemed suspicious to Torres. 
During her reporting, she received a tip about Tokosh’s Reddit posts in which he wrote of his “clown fetish” and how he enlisted his students to participate in it.
“It wasn’t just this innocent thing that a lot of these girls thought it was,” Torres said. “As a professor or teacher, that is somebody students are supposed to trust. He used his power to ruin that trust and to do these things, and that made me angry for them.”
Torres spoke to six students who shared their experiences with Tokosh. Some, she said, were followed on Twitter by him while others opted into an extra credit assignment he offered.
The women told Torres he sometimes giggled and laughed as they painted their faces in his office.
On March 27, the Nicholls Worth published a story headlined, “Geography professor suspended immediately, students allege sexual harassment.” KNSU TV, a student broadcast network, also aired footage in which Tokosh defended the assignment on camera. That same day, Tokosh submitted his resignation.
The story’s publication prompted other students to come forward about Tokosh and their frustration with the university.
Bradley Price took an online class with Tokosh and said the professor required students to photograph themselves with their faces painted. Price said Tokosh told them the assignment was to help them understand Japanese culture, but then Tokosh offered him bonus points if he could get a female friend to paint her face.
It seemed unusual at the time, Price said, because his friend wasn’t in the class. It became more concerning to him on reading the student newspaper’s report.
“I feel frankly disgusted and disappointed that Nicholls couldn’t do a proper background check on this professor, because this is unacceptable,” Price said. 
Bella Ramos, a junior at Nicholls State who did not take any of Tokosh’s classes, told USA TODAY that someone using the handle @Joeography21 followed her on Twitter in late 2021 and started liking all her selfies.
Ramos learned that the person behind the account was likely a professor at the university. She posted about the behavior in January 2022, but nothing came of it. She also found the Joeography Reddit account. On March 27, the same day the student newspaper published its piece, Ramos posted screenshots of her discoveries on Twitter with the message, “Found a Nicholls state university professor on Reddit.”
“I wish the university had acted sooner because all this information was public on the internet,” she told USA TODAY.

As Israel continued to press its assault on Gaza after Hamas infiltrated by land, sea and air over the weekend, killing and capturing over 1,000 Israelis, the spotlight has focused on the militant group.
Israel's leaders have vowed retaliation, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas "will pay an unprecedented price."
Hamas' political wing has controlled the Gaza Strip for over a decade, but the group is most known for its many suicide bombings and other attacks on Israel amid the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has lasted decades. It's considered a terrorist group by the United States and other nations.
Here's what to know about Hamas:
Latest updates:Israel regains control over Gaza Strip border; rocket attacks intensify
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. Hamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since.
The U.S. State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.
The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Up to 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea beginning at daybreak Saturday in an attack that caught Israel's military off guard.
Hamas leaders say they were pushed to attack because of an Israeli crackdown on militants in the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers to be illegal − thousands of prisoners being held in Israeli jails and Israel's ongoing blockade of Gaza.
Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ military wing, said “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm,” was a response to activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem that is the third holiest site in Islam. The site, which is also located on the holiest site for Jews − who refer to it as the Temple Mount − has long been a flashpoint between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli security services routinely raid the compound.
“Enough is enough,” Deif said in a recorded message. “Today the people are regaining their revolution.”
Deif leads the military wing while Yehia Sinwar, in Gaza, and Ismail Haniyeh, who lives in exile, are the senior leader of Hamas.
Israel estimates the group has about 30,000 fighters and an arsenal of rockets and unmanned drones.
A day after Hamas launched its attack, Hezbollah also fired dozens of rockets and shells at three Israeli positions in disputed area along the country's border with Syria's Golan Heights, occupied by Israel. The attack was in solidarity with the “Palestinian resistance," Hezbollah said.
Hezbollah is a Lebanese political and militant group that's been around since the early 1980s, funded and backed by Iran and spreading Tehran's influence in the Middle East.
Like Hamas, Hezbollah is designated a terrorist group by the United States and opposes Israel, but Hamas pales in comparison to Hezbollah in terms of its terrorist capabilities. The Shiite Muslim militia has also attacked Israel with rockets in the past.

WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden is set to give his first major speech Tuesday following Hamas' brutal massacre in Israel in a display of U.S. support for Israel as war erupts in the Middle East.
Biden will speak from the White House State Dining Room at 1 p.m. ET.
The address comes after Biden gave brief remarks Saturday, declaring "the United States stands with the State of Israel" and that “Israel has the right to defend itself and its people," immediately following the deadliest attack on Israel in decades.
More than 1,000 Israelis and at least 11 Americans were killed when Hamas militants crashed through the Israeli border along the Gaza Strip and launched a surprise invasion. Israel has responded with attacks on Gaza that intensified with more bombings Tuesday.
An estimated 100 to 150 people in Israel were kidnapped by Hamas militants and are being held captive in Gaza. That includes some Americans. Hamas leaders have warned they will execute hostages if Israel does not cease airstrikes on Gaza without warnings.
On Tuesday morning, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about "coordinated efforts with partners and allies" to defend Israel, the White House said.
The attack is another major foreign policy test for Biden who is already struggling to keep assistance flowing to Ukraine.
It jeopardizes the administration’s efforts to help Israel and Saudi Arabia formalize relations, one of the ways Biden had hoped would stabilize the Middle East and allow attention to be focused on the growing challenge of China.
And Republicans are trying to lay some of the blame for the attacks on the administration, pointing to a recent deal to free Americans held in Iran that gave Iran access to $6 billion in frozen funds. Iran is a longtime supporter of Hammas.
The administration has responded that the money, which has not yet been released, can only be spent for humanitarian purposes.
Hamas was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or Islamic resistance movement. The group’s charter calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel.
The political wing of Hamas was born in later years. Hamas' political wing has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2006, which prompted Israel to enforce a blockade on Gaza.
It was founded by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist organization with ties to Egypt. Iran provides Hamas with financial, material and logistical support and it also cooperates with Hezbollah, another Iran-backed, U.S.-designated terrorist group, based in Lebanon.
The militant organization is committed to the destruction of Israel and has been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., the EU and various nations.
The group has vowed to annihilate Israel and has been responsible for many suicide bombings and other deadly attacks on civilians and Israeli soldiers.
Over the years, Hamas received backing from Arab countries, such as Qatar and Turkey. Recently, it’s moved closer to Iran and its allies.
Hamas has said it attacked Israel in response to mounting Palestinian suffering under Israeli occupation and Israel's and Egypt's 16-year blockade of Gaza that has decimated Gaza's economy.
Israel has made peace deals with Arab counties in recent years but not made concessions in its long conflict with the Palestinians. The U.S. has tried to reach a deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a bitter rival of Hamas’ Iranian backers.
Meanwhile, Israel’s new far-right government was working to cement Israeli settlements in the West Bank despite Palestinian opposition.
Hamas leaders say an Israeli crackdown on militants in the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community has deemed illegal − thousands of prisoners in Israeli jails, and its ongoing blockade of Gaza pushed it to attack.
Hamas' surprise sea, land and air attack resulted in the largest one-day killing of Jews since the Holocaust.
The attack began with thousands of rockets fired from inside the Gaza Strip into Israel early Saturday. About an hour later, Hamas gunmen crossed the Israeli border at different locations and began attacking residential areas and military bases.
Hamas militants killed an estimated 260 people at the Supernova music festival in a section of open desert near Kibbutz Re’im, about 2 miles from the Gaza border. An unknown number were taken hostage.

Florida's Department of Health agreed to a settlement requiring it to provide more detailed COVID-19 data, after a group sued in 2021 for the release of records during the state's COVID-19 surge.
The new data will detail vaccination counts, case counts and deaths. It'll be aggregated weekly for the next three years, grouped by county, age group, gender and race.
The department provides more general COVID-19 data every two weeks.
"COVID-19 data will shift from the previously published Biweekly Reports and now solely be available on Florida CHARTS alongside all other public health data," Jae Williams, the department's press secretary, said.
The court did not order the state to display the data but the department decided to do so, he said.
The department will also have to pay $152,500 in legal fees. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit included former Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando; the Florida Center for Government Accountability; the USA TODAY Network; the Miami Herald; the Associated Press; Scripps Media Co.; The New York Times; The Washington Post; the Sun-Sentinel; the Tampa Bay Times and the First Amendment Foundation.
“All Floridians have a constitutional right to public records and the right to receive critical public health data in a timely manner in order to make informed decisions impacting the health and safety of their families," Smith said in a Monday press release.
"The Department lied about the existence of these public records in court and did everything to restrict information and downplay the threat of COVID even while the delta variant ripped through Florida – a decision that cost many lives," said Smith, who is running for a state Senate seat. "The DeSantis Administration settled in our favor because they knew what they did was wrong."
The governor's office referred a media request to the Florida Department of Health.
Williams, the department's press secretary, called Smith's news release a "political stunt" and its characterization strange, pointing to a line in the settlement agreement that reads it "is not and shall not in any way be construed as an admission by any Party of any wrongdoing or any violation of any law."
"It is unfortunate that we have continued to waste government resources arguing over the formatting of data with armchair epidemiologists who have zero training or expertise," Williams told the USA TODAY Network in an email. "While some individuals may continue to grapple for political relevancy and disregard providing the public with the truth, we will continue serving Floridians by executing our core mission of protecting, promoting, and improving the health of all people in Florida. "
An Orange County Board member requested Smith gather data from the state Department of Health on pediatric hospitalizations and cases. This happened as the state was the epicenter of the COVID-19 surge during the summer of 2021 from the delta variant and ranked No. 1 in pediatric cases.
The department denied Smith's request, stating in part, that the data for Orange County is "confidential and exempt from public disclosure” under Florida statutes and rules.
The nonprofit watchdog organization Florida Center for Government Accountability made the same records request for all of Florida's 67 counties and the request was denied for the same reasons.
The watchdog group and Smith filed suit. Several major news media companies, including the USA TODAY Network, joined the suit. So did the First Amendment Foundation.
The department claimed in court that the requested records didn't exist, according to a press release. But the department released the records in March following a state appellate court order.
The parties agreed to a settlement after the watchdog group informed the department that those records satisfied the public records requests made almost two years before, according to the release.
Michael Barfield, director of public access initiatives at the Florida Center for Government Accountability, said the department hid the records to validate a narrative the state was open for business.
“Transparency and accountability are not negotiable. The Constitution mandates it,” he said.
The settlement comes during Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign. The Republican has used his COVID-19 record to try and gain more support in his White House bid.
He rose to conservative stardom early in the pandemic in large part due to his COVID-19 policies, such as penalizing mask and vaccine mandates.
His administration, at the same time, slow-walked or refused coronavirus-related public information requests, drawing controversy and lawsuits, such as those by Smith and the Florida Center for Government Accountability.
He picked Joseph Ladapo as Florida's surgeon general. Ladapo, who's also named in the lawsuit, frequently defies medical consensus to boost vaccine skepticism.
Attempting to chip away at some of the MAGA vote, DeSantis has elevated coronavirus and vaccine skepticism conspiracies and attacked Trump for the COVID-19 restrictions that happened during his presidency.
"Why are we in this mess? Part of it, and a major reason is because how this federal government handled COVID-19 by locking down this economy," DeSantis said during the first GOP presidential primary debate. "It was a mistake. It should have never happened. And in Florida, we led the country out of lockdown."

Three days after conflict broke out between Hamas militants and Israel, the toll has risen to approximately 1,000 missing or killed Israelis, 1,500 dead militants, and at least 11 deceased Americans.
President Joe Biden has said that some U.S. citizens remain unaccounted for, and estimates show that 130 or more people were kidnapped by Hamas, with at least one American-Israeli among them.
The FBI has issued a statement assuring that, while there is no specific threat to the U.S., the agency is working with partners in Israel to find impacted Americans there. "Reports of deceased, injured or missing Americans are being treated with the utmost urgency and aggressively investigated," the statement posted on X reads.
As airlines halt flights to and from the country and The State Department issues travel advisories for the region, several elected officials have said that their constituents are reaching out for help getting out.
At least five American groups traveling to Israel have found themselves stuck in a violent and destructive dispute. Here are those groups, their shelter plans and how they've planned to make it home.
As reported by AL.com, St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, located in Daphne, Alabama, and Shades Mountain Baptist Church in Vestavia Hills, Ala.,are trying to get their members out of the Israel.
Reverend Thack Dyson is in Israel with members of the St. Paul's Episcopal Church on a tour. They started their trip in Tel Aviv on Friday, but moved to the northern part of the country when the war broke out, AL.com reported.
"Good morning and welcome to morning prayer this Sunday morning in beautiful Galilee," Dyson said in a Facebook live video posted Sunday. "We're here in the middle of a war. This is not what we planned, but this is what we got."
He has been providing updates about the group in the daily prayer videos. The group had three previously-booked flights cancelled, and as of Tuesday morning, he said that some members were able to start traveling home. The group is spreading out their journey home across several days and routes.
"We will certainly have a story to tell when we get back," Dyson said. "But we will get back."
Eleven people belonging to the Shades Mountain Baptist Church are also stuck in Israel, AL.com reported. A pastor at the church called for prayer Sunday morning, saying they are safe but hoping they return soon. Shade Mountain Baptist Church did not immediately return USA TODAY's request for comment.
Westchester County District Attorney Miriam Rocah said in a statement that a 32-member New York delegation traveled to Israel Oct. 5 for counterterrorism and anti-Semitism training.
"I am in communication with our Deputy Chief who informed me that though the delegation is close to the Gaza Strip, they are sheltering in a safe location and every effort is underway for their safe return to New York," the Facebook post on Saturday read.
The New York Times reported that they were in Ashdod, and they spent Saturday taking cover in bomb shelters. They were able to leave Sunday via a connecting flight through Dubai.
“This was not the plan, to fly into a war zone,” one of the trip organizers Mitchell Silber told The New York Times, saying it was surprising even for seasoned law enforcement officers.
WhyIs Iran behind Hamas terrorist attacks? What it would mean for US and Middle East security
A group of 12 travelers from First Baptist Church in Knoxville, Tennessee, went to Israel to follow the historical footsteps of Jesus, and now is exploring alternative ways to get out of a country that has become a war zone.
While the group might be able to depart on its scheduled flight Oct. 21, armed conflict with Hamas could render its travel plans impossible.
"We are exploring options for alternative travel in the event that we realize even where we are is unsafe," Senior Pastor Brent McDougal told Knox News, part of the USA TODAY Network, on Monday, Oct. 9, from Jerusalem, where he said the group was safe. "In the meantime, we plan to continue with as much of our itinerary until we believe that it's just untenable to stay. ... We're seeking to be wise in our decisions and ask people to pray for us."
The group, which arrived in Tel Aviv on Oct. 6, is scheduled to fly out of the city but might seek options for a flight from another country or leave sooner if violence reaches Jerusalem. For now, they are enclosed in the Old City section of Jerusalem, where sacred sites like the Western Wall and the Dome of the Rock mosque rest within ancient walls.

A group of 42 from the Morning Star Church in Dardenne Prairie, Missouri, was on a pilgrimage in Israel when the conflict broke out, reported KSDK, a St. Louis NBC affiliate.
"I know they heard sirens, I know there was a lot of concern," Morning Star Church member Trevor Wolfe told KSDK.
Pastor Mike Schreiner has been releasing video updates from abroad on Facebook. Initially the group planned to fly out of Jerusalem Sunday, but they took a bus across the border to Jordan after their flights were canceled.
They hope to be safe from the conflict in Jordan and will take varied flight paths back to the U.S., according to KSDK.

Call me old fashioned, or maybe I have a terrible case of clumsy thumbs. If I have a choice between texting or a phone call to converse with someone, I choose a call most of the time. 
It’s faster, easier, and I can do it safely while driving, walking, or folding laundry. Also? If someone calls and doesn’t leave me a voice message, I will likely assume they don’t need to talk with me. 
According to the latest rules of smartphone etiquette − and my 22-year-old daughter − I’m doing it all wrong. 
As new technology changes, so do the rules of engagement around it, and it’s harder than ever to keep up! 
While common sense should dictate that it’s not polite to talk on our cell phones while we’re in a bathroom or use the speakerphone in a movie theater, clearly, some people missed that memo. 
Doing either is considered baseline rude at best, but I witnessed both in the last week alone. If some people are still so oblivious to the most obvious tech-related social faux pas, how are we supposed to pick up on the new stuff, like whether we should text someone before we call them or when to use the latest iOS 17 video voicemail feature? 
“Much like everything else, behavior evolves based on the situation,” national etiquette expert Diane Gottsman wrote via email. When everyday situations change for the masses, such as more people using FaceTime and making videos in public places, there are social nuances that are simply more polite, sensitive, and respectful to others, she explained. 
Before we go through specifics, though, it’s important to note that what works for close friends and family is not the same for business or professional relationships. Also, age can play a role in what’s socially acceptable.
For instance, I can’t get all judgey if someone texts or DMs in all lowercase without punctuation anymore. My 23-year-old production assistant recently told me it’s kind of rude to add a period even when I’m texting her. It’s like I’m being passive-aggressive and not as sincere. 
“You can’t assume everyone understands or communicates the same way. Many abbreviations are age-related or even depend on a person’s country of origin. It’s important to mirror the communication style of the person you speak with,” Gottsman added, especially in client or work situations. 
Context is key, but ever-evolving rules of modern-day etiquette are also good to know. Here are some of the most important. 
Gottsman, who owns the Protocol School of Texas, said you should now text someone before you call them. “It’s a social courtesy that allows the receiver to let you know if they are available. If they don’t respond, you can assume it’s a bad time to talk,” she said. 
That would drive me insane, I wrote back to Gottsman. It adds extra work to respond, and isn’t that what voicemail’s for − especially now that iOS 17 shows a transcript of what the person is saying as they’re leaving a message − so you can decide if you want to pick up? 
“You would assume that if someone doesn’t pick up, it’s because they can’t take your call or are in a place where they can’t speak freely. However, many people continue to call over and over again, which is a big cell phone ‘no,’” Gottsman clarified. “People's lives are busier now, and we are all aware of how intrusive a phone call can be. A quick text first to see if someone is available alleviates an interruption in a meeting, at dinner, or during a job interview.”
Exceptions: 
It’s OK to call first if you’re reaching out to friends or family or if it’s an emergency. 
Also, you don't have to pick up if someone calls you and it’s not a good time.
Responding to a call with an automated text response is fine, especially if you add a custom reply. That happens to me a few times every day. If I’m already on the phone, I often type in a speedy personal response, such as, ‘I’m on the phone now, but will call you back as soon as I’m off.’
When is the right time to leave a voicemail? If you ask someone in their teens, 20s, or even 30s, they will likely say, “never.” 
Gottsman also says it’s never okay to leave a long-winded voicemail and agrees that most don’t get listened to. “Most people see you have called, and rather than listen to the voicemail, just call you back anyway. It saves time.” 
It’s also essential to leave your full name and callback number, even though it often appears on screens automatically. “Don’t assume the person will recognize you just by your first name or that your message or call back number will go through clearly. Make sure they can reach you without creating extra work for them,” Gottsman noted. 
Exceptions: 
Emergencies, important work messages, and emotions are often best handled via voice versus text.  
It’s also OK to leave a voice message for family −anytime and any length.
“There are people who want to hear your voice and enjoy listening to your message,” Gottsman added. “But for someone you don’t know as well, ask them how they prefer to communicate.” 
Again, it’s fine if it’s someone close to you. But as a general rule, no. Arrange a video call first. 
I recently went down an hours-long rabbit hole on this topic on both Reddit and Quora, and wow, does it make people mad when you FaceTime them without permission. “It’s the same as walking into someone’s house uninvited,” wrote one person on a Reddit AITA subgroup. 
Another new iOS 17 update lets you leave a video message when someone doesn’t answer your FaceTime call. If you’re traveling and want to show something special to a loved one, show off a baby’s first steps to grandparents, or even your amazing new highlight to your BFF, it’s fine. (As long as you’re following the etiquette rules of FaceTiming in public, which is next on this list.) 
But most people who aren’t related to or in love with you don’t want a video message. “Don’t assume everyone enjoys watching you on video,” Gottsman added. 
That goes tenfold for a NSFW video! Just don’t. 
Too many updates?:Apple is urging everyone to update iPhone and iPad iOS (again). Why you should do it now.
Best charging cable:In need of an iPhone 15 charging cable? Here's how to find the best USB-C charger cord
The answer here depends on where you are and who’s around you. Most people think it’s rude to FaceTime in a public place, especially without headphones on or when anyone else is in the background other than you. 
It’s considered good form to keep a distance of at least 10 feet from the nearest person when you’re on your smartphone, especially if you’re using video of any kind. Most of us tend to talk louder on cellphones than in real life, so talk quietly and be aware of your surroundings before you turn your video camera on, period. 
The number of people FaceTiming or doing social media videos in front of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre when we visited there this time last year was so incredibly cringey; it took away from the experience overall. 
Consider going somewhere else when your actions take away from other people’s enjoyment of any public space. This includes blasting your music, playing video games, or watching videos without headphones or sound effects turned off. 
Here are more smartphone manners that haven’t changed:
It’s (still) not okay to have your smartphone at the dinner table. The only exception is if you’re expecting a life-or-death text or call. In that case, let everyone around you know you might have to answer your phone.  
Shhhh! Use your “inside voice,” and watch your language. Cursing might be the new “hello” for some people, but experts, it’s still considered poor manners in most public situations.  
Put your phone away and do not check it during meetings, Gottsman reiterates. “Cell phones are a distraction, especially in work situations. Looking down or checking your smartphone or smartwatch appears as if you are distracted, impatient, or checking to see who is texting you,” she said. 
It’s also best to keep business correspondence professional. “This includes emails as well as texts. If you have a fun, relaxed relationship with your client and they use emojis, you can feel free to respond in kind. But don’t overdo it. A well-placed emoji is fine, but allowing the emojis to take over your message is unprofessional.”
Beware of ‘phubbing,’ which is snubbing other people for your phone. It happens all the time, too. Parents check social media when their kids need attention. Couples do it during “snuggle time.” I just did it a little while ago to my dog. She was staring at me to go for a walk, and I was distracted by a hilarious TikTok video. 
Not only are these behaviors rude, but studies show they break up relationships, cause crowd fights, and might even hurt people — and pets — you care about the most

This week Apple rushed out an emergency patch to fix a serious security flaw for iPhones and iPads.
The zero-day vulnerability which allows attackers to elevate privileges may have already been exploited, Apple said. 
Apple patched the flaw in the iOS 17.0.3 and iPadOS 17.0.3 updates. It did not provide additional details.
“This update provides important bug fixes, security updates and addresses an issue that may cause iPhone to run warmer than expected,” Apple said.
So what’s with all the Apple security updates?
Apple’s cat-and-mouse game with zero-day hackers seems to be picking up. 
According to SecurityWeek, this was the 16th documented zero-day exploit against Apple’s iOS, iPadOS and macOS-powered devices. 
The list of affected devices include: iPhone XS and later as well as iPad Pro 12.9-inch 2nd generation and later, iPad Pro 10.5-inch, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 6th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later.
Should you worry about all of these iOS updates? In general, yes. 
“We all have to realize there is an industry out there that is actively targeting our devices and all the personal information we have on them,” said researcher John Scott Railton, a senior researcher with Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School.
But we should not be alarmed by the frequency of the Apple security patches, according to Railton. The growing number of updates are a sign that Apple is working hard to keep our devices secure, he said.
“Apple is, from my perspective, really leaning into hunting for and quickly fixing this kind of bug,” Railton said. “It’s a little bit like, why do you hear so many sirens? Because the ambulance service is finally going to people’s houses when they call.”
But it’s not just down to Apple, Railton said. There are steps we can all take to protect our devices from incursions.
No one gets excited about updating their phone. But, said Railton, “every time you update, you make your device more secure.”
First, you should make sure automatic updates are turned on. 
Install updates as soon as you hear about them. Here’s how:
If you are at higher risk or are just concerned about security, use lockdown mode on your iPhone. Here’s how. 
“What researchers have found is that lockdown mode blocks a lot of sophisticated attacks, even without the phone being updated. Of course, people need to update their phone. But lockdown mode in some cases would have blocked attacks even before Apple knew about this specific exploit or there was a patch released,” Railton said. “It radically increases the security of your device and makes it way more expensive for bad actors to hack into your stuff.”

President Joe Biden will give remarks Tuesday afternoon after Israel declared war on the Gaza strip over the weekend following deadly surprise attacks by Hamas.
USA TODAY will be providing live coverage beginning at 1 p.m. ET. You can watch at the video at the top of the page or on USA TODAY's YouTube channel.
More than 1,600 Israelis and Palestinians have died since the conflict began, including at least 11 Americans, and thousands more injured. Hamas has claimed to have taken more than 130 hostages, and Israel has ordered a siege on Gaza pledging to cut electricity, food and fuel to the impoverished home of more than 2 million Palestinians.
In a statement, Biden’s National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said: "The United States unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians. There is never any justification for terrorism.”
Biden has also condemned the Hamas attacks in an address, saying the U.S. stands with Israel, and his administration's support for Israel's security is "rock solid and unwavering."

Good gourd, it's one giant pumpkin!
A 43-year-old Minnesota educator can now boast he's grown the heaviest pumpkin on earth.
Travis Gienger, a horticulture and landscape teacher at Anoka Technical College, set a new world record Monday for growing the plumpest pumpkin on the planet after growing one weighing 2,749 pounds.
For perspective: according to an online Alaska Wild fact sheet, Gienger's pumpkin is about the equivalent weight of an adult male walrus.
A photo of Gienger celebrating after winning the 50th World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off in Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco shows him dressed in an orange long-sleeve shirt and matching shoes, celebrating with a fist in the air before a crowd of spectators and photographers.
Aside from pride, Gienger won $9 per pound, ($24,741) as well as a special $30,000 "mega-prize" for the new world-record breaking pumpkin, contest officials said.
"I was not expecting that. It was quite the feeling," Gienger told The Associated Press.

Gienger set the new world record by adding 47 pounds to the pumpkin he grew in his backyard, the AP reported.
The grower told the news outlet he decided to give his seeds extra care as he grew them this year, adding extra fertilizer and watering them sometimes a dozen times a day.
The previous world record, according to Guinness World Records, was set at 2,702 pounds, grown a grown in 2021 by Stefano Cutrupi from Tuscany, Italy.
Gienger also set the U.S. record last year when one he created one weighing 2,560 pounds and two years prior in 2020, when he grew one weighing 2,350 pounds.
Grow on, Gienger. Grow on.

Sometimes you’ve just got to go for what your heart desires. That’s what a New York 8-year-old did when his dad was leaving for work.
Barefoot and still in his pajamas, Isaiah Lobdell ran out of his house on Aug. 3 as his dad was pulling out of the family’s driveway to start his workday as an ironworker.
After successfully flagging his dad down, his father got out of his truck, picked the boy up and the two shared an adorable, tight hug.
The moment was captured on the family’s doorbell camera and uploaded to TikTok. It has amassed 1.5 million views and nearly 183,000 favorites since then.
“The ‘I’ve gotta go to work’ hugs always hit a little different,” Tyler, the boy’s father, captioned the upload.
Made up of dad Tyler, mom Hailey and sons Isaiah and Hudson, the Lobdell family live in Constantia, just north of Syracuse. 
The family says hugs are a huge part of their mornings.
“I probably have to give like five hugs a morning to each kid,” Tyler said. “Anytime they ask for it, I always go for it. I never turn down a hug.”

Isaiah told USA TODAY Monday evening that he ran out to see his dad because he just wanted to. 
“He forgot to give me a hug and I wanted one,” Isaiah said. “He was going off for work so I was like ‘I’ve got to go get him now.’”
“Did he forget to give you a hug or did he forget to give you a tenth hug?” his mom, Hailey, laughed.
Isaiah loves his dad and he just likes hugging him, he said. His younger brother Hudson does too.
Tyler, the boys’ father, said when he saw his son running out of the house, he knew he wanted another hug. Once the sweet moment was over, something told him to check the family’s doorbell footage.
He was originally going to save the recording for himself but after watching it “a bunch of times,” he decided to share it on social media.
Tyler’s wife, Hailey, said the family is shocked by how many people have watched and commented on the video. Moments like this are a reality check for many people, she said.
“It reminds people of what they have, what they used to have, what they wish they had, and for some reason, people really gravitated toward us,” she said. “It was a good reminder for a lot of people to just slow down or appreciate when you still have these things or look back fondly on memories.”
His wife said it’s amazing that such a simple moment between a dad and son could inspire so many people.
“We kind of have referred to it as the hug heard ‘round the world,” she said. “It was just such a simple thing between a kid and a dad, just something that happens with us all the time. When you really stop and think about it, it inspires a lot of gratitude.”

The Lobdells save moments like these to look back on in the future. Their boys are growing so quickly and sometimes, they’re amazed by how much they’ve changed in just a year or so.
“It's crazy,” their mother said. “You look back on a video from a year ago and now that they're a little older, you think ‘They haven't changed that much.’ But when you really look back at pictures and videos, you realize they have grown and changed so much.”
The boys like looking back at their old photos and videos. The family often sits down to look at photos and reflect on memories they all share.
“The way our phones are now, with such nice cameras, we're really trying to take advantage of being able to take pictures and videos,” Tyler said.
Sometimes they hear the way the boys used to say phrases as babies and it makes them laugh and smile so much that they become part of daily conversation, the parents said.
“They're super creative kids,” their mom said. “They want us to feel love. They want to feel love.”
The first and third-grade boys are very personable too, their mother said.
“No one would accuse them of being shy,” she laughed.
The boys have “huge imaginations,” their mother said. They love building and they have tons of blocks they like to play with. Their house is full of their latest construction projects, their parents said.

In addition to the hug video that captured the hearts of millions online, the family also uploads other videos to TikTok and film content for their YouTube channel called The Activity Archives.
Tyler said the boys asked to make YouTube videos last year. They get together with cousins and other family members to do activities outdoors such as ice fishing, magnet fishing and more.
The idea is to get parents to go outside with their kids, the boys' father said.
“We try to think of fun, different activities that we can do that may inspire parents to be like ‘Oh, we want to do that with our kids,’” Tyler said.
The family appreciates the kind words people have sent their way since their TikTok video went viral. 
“It's reached so many people and so many people have felt it so deeply,” he said. “So many kids have gotten extra hugs and I think that part, for me personally, is the part that I really enjoy the most about it…to know that we're spreading love that way.”

WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court is being asked to weigh a ban on “conversion therapy” − the practice of trying to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity − in an appeal that tests the court's appetite for engaging this term in the legal battle between religion and LGBTQ+ rights.
Long discredited and already banned for minors in about half of U.S. states, the practice of using ''treatment'' to make a gay or lesbian person straight has reemerged as the Supreme Court has become more conservative and receptive to appeals dealing with religious freedom. Opponents say the practice can involve electrical shocks and nausea-inducing drugs as well as psychoanalysis and counseling.
Brian Tingley, a licensed family counselor in Washington state, is challenging the state's ban on the practice for people under 18, claiming it violates his free speech and religious rights. The law, he told the Supreme Court this year, "forbids him from speaking, treating his professional license as a license for government censorship."
Preview:The Supreme Court gets back to work. Here are the cases to watch.
Opponents of the practice say states have banned it for minors because it increases the risk of depression and suicide for LGBTQ+ young people. Washington's law doesn't apply to churches or religious groups, only to therapists who are licensed – and regulated – by the state.  
"This is a dangerous practice," said Laurel Stine, chief policy officer for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. "The Supreme Court has not taken up any of these challenges before, and we are confident that, if they do, we will win."
The justices were set to discuss the case privately Friday and could announce as soon as Tuesday whether they will decide it or allow a lower court ruling against Tingley to stand.
The court has declined to hear similar challenges in the past, leaving other state bans in place. But those challenging the bans note that the Supreme Court also recently handed down a decision that appeared to strengthen First Amendment speech protections in the workplace.
As the Supreme Court has become more conservative in recent years, it has taken a keen interest in cases involving religious freedom.
Tingley argues that a 2018 decision by the Supreme Court involving anti-abortion pregnancy centers should weigh in his favor. In that case, a 5-4 majority of the court’s conservatives said a California law that required the pregnancy centers to notify clients about publicly funded abortion and contraception services likely violated the First Amendment.

While California argued its law regulated "professional speech," such as what a therapist might say to a client during a session, the Supreme Court ruled it had never carved out a separate category of workplace speech subject to different First Amendment protections. Then in 2020, a federal court of appeals in Atlanta relied on that Supreme Court decision to block enforcement of similar "conversion therapy" bans in parts of Florida.
Tingley is represented by the religious rights group Alliance Defending Freedom, which has filed several successful religious appeals at the Supreme Court in recent years. John Bursch, the group’s senior counsel, said he fears governments could try to label other speech “professional conduct” in an effort to engage in widespread censorship.
"Bottom line: The government cannot censor a counselor’s speech," Bursch said. "Washington's counseling censorship law violates freedom of speech and harms counselors and their clients."
A U.S. District court in Washington dismissed Tingley’s case in 2021. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit sided against him last year.
Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, did not respond to a request for comment.
The case is Tingley v. Ferguson.
Religious groups and individuals have collected significant wins at the Supreme Court in recent years, expanding religious protections in the workplace, knocking down anti-discrimination laws intended to protect LGBTQ+ people, and opening the door for taxpayer money for schools that offer religious instruction.
In one high-profile case last year, the Supreme Court sided with a web designer who wants to decline to create websites for same-sex weddings because of her religious beliefs. The designer, Lorie Smith, who was also represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, successfully argued that Colorado's anti-discrimination law compelled her to make speech she disagreed with.
"Laws along these lines have done much to secure the civil rights of all Americans," Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for a 6-3 majority. "But in this particular case Colorado does not just seek to ensure the sale of goods or services on equal terms. It seeks to use its law to compel an individual to create speech she does not believe."
Tingley's attorneys suggested in court filings that the decision for Smith works so strongly in his favor that the Supreme Court could decide the case without hearing arguments.
But so far this term, the court has yet to grant a religious-freedom case.
Critics say they believe the law − and the science − is on their side when it comes to "conversion therapy" bans. The American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the National Association for Social Workers and other leading medical groups have all repudiated the practice.
Casey Pick, director of law and policy for The Trevor Project, which focuses on suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ young people, said every court that has considered a statewide ban has upheld it.
"There is no reason the (Supreme) Court should not do the same here," she said, "and ensure that LGBTQ young people across the country continue to be protected from unprofessional, unscientific and deeply harmful practices."

Every time he goes on social media, Aziz Abu Sarah feels sick to his stomach. The Palestinian man has Jewish friends who've lost family members. Friends taken hostage.
"I worry for them like I worry for my Palestinian friends who are in Gaza now, living under bombardment of air strikes," says the author of "Crossing Boundaries: A Traveler’s Guide to World Peace." "We need to see the nuances."
Social media, however, often renders nuance obsolete.
Misinformation and propaganda about the Israel-Hamas conflict – which has resulted in more than 900 Israelis and upwards of 680 Palestinians dead, just days into a new war – fills social media feeds and shows no signs of slowing. Some posts mention the death toll on only one side. Some ignore the civilians taken hostage. Some fail to mention Israel's occupation of Gaza. Some don't account for why Jewish people around the world grow afraid.
These posts often come from those far away from the conflict, like in the U.S., who feel like they have to say something for the sake of seeming involved. But declaring support for one "side" over the other and listing out-of-context information about Israelis and Palestinians may hurt more than help your cause.
Infographic social media posts trying to detail a topic as fraught, as frustrating, as long-lasting as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will always lack critical details due to social media's bite-size commentary nature. Experts warn you should seek greater context before sharing anything. It's perfectly acceptable – and even preferred – for you to stay quiet if you don't know enough about what you're talking about.
"Not everything is black and white," Abu Sarah says. "And to me, it's most painful when I see people I know, people who I respect, people who I love, who have fallen for these (posts) and feel that they need to serve 'their country, their cause, their people,' whatever, by spreading misinformation. It's devastating to me."
Abu Sarah worries the propaganda and misinformation could be result in deadly consequences, for those in the Middle East and elsewhere. "People will read it, get angry and do things."

Websites like Instagram and X, formerly known as Twitter, speak in soundbites, not dissertations.
"You only have a certain amount of space where you can post your tweet or one photo or two, and it doesn't necessarily lend itself to any kind of nuance, or real, significant conversation," says Shaya Lerner, the director of Israel Affairs at the Anti-Defamation League.
The sites have historically faced difficulty combating antisemitic and Islamophobic posts.
Plus, "we know that algorithms can trend toward feeding people polarizing and extremist content to keep them clicking," says Sarah Parkinson, assistant professor of political science and international studies at Johns Hopkins University. "The lack of moderation makes it easy for individuals and organizations to harass people into silence."
Social media infographics, of course, can be helpful resources in educating those completely uninformed. It's when people don't go beyond theses sources that trouble looms. Rabbi Rick Jacobs, President of the Union for Reform Judaism, says: "There are positive, important things that we can do with postings on social media. But the boundaries are not clear. And the abuses are quite evident."
Jacobs says some of the posts he's seen have hurt.
"I, every day, would not only defend but really strongly defend the rights of Palestinians to have dignity and human rights," Jacobs says. "But for me to say that (Hamas) this group of terrorists who are trying to literally murder women and children and families and rip families apart and take them captive, and (for some on social media) to be able to say with a straight face, this is such a noble thing they're doing. That just offends every sensibility I have."
Many argue that the decades of violence against Palestinians under Israeli occupation warrants mentioning to better contextualize the attack on Israel.
"The cancer patients in Gaza who can't receive medical treatment, because they're not allowed out of the enclave, and yet they die as a result of that, that's violence," says Saree Makdisi, UCLA professor and author of "Palestine Inside Out: An Everyday Occupation."
He wants to see instances like these illustrated more on social media, which is often too simplified: "It's not all big explosions, and fires and rockets and tanks and this kind of thing," he adds.
How to cope:The videos out of Israel, Gaza are graphic, but some can't look away
So if social media infographic posting and re-posting isn't the right answer, what is?
"My advice to people is always to read a broad spectrum of media outlets, including media from the region, and to understand what it is that they’re reading," Parkinson says. "Search the outlet, read a Wikipedia page on it; don’t just go to one news source to understand any situation. Verify that what you’re reading a credible outlet or source. Seek out local voices and establish who they are."
Makdisi adds: "It's important to understand the context and the history of this violence, where it's come from, where it's going, and what the possible solutions are, that involve peace and justice for all sides." Granted, what peace and justice look like, and if it's even achievable, differs depending who you're asking.
That doesn't mean social media is useless, either. Abu Sarah suggests following those who have different points of view. He also recommends sharing stories of unity: "There are today, Israelis and Palestinians who are doing the impossible to support each other. I can tell you dozens of these stories and yet unfortunately, those are the missing stories, whether it's on social media or in our discussions."
If you decide to post something, don't expect everyone to agree with you. "Remember that many on social media already have their minds made up and will respond to what they 'think' you are saying rather than your actual words," says psychologist Reneé Carr.
When you stop thinking of the other "side" as human, you've lost. Abu Sarah adds: "If you think one side is a pure evil and one side is pure good, you're missing the story."

A year ago, President Joe Biden’s plan was to forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt for tens of millions of Americans. 
With that plan now extinct, the first of several conversations to hash out a new strategy for erasing loan balances en masse begins Tuesday.  
"Creating clearer regulations will ensure the authority to waive student debt is used in a fair and lawful manner," said James Kvaal, under secretary of education. "We believe that doing so will strengthen the entire student loan system, help us tackle pervasive problems in the system, and help ensure postsecondary education is a path to opportunity for more students."
As the process of negotiated rulemaking, or neg reg as it’s sometimes called in federalese, gets underway, tens of millions of Americans are wrestling with student loan payments for the first time in more than three years. Social media is littered with evidence of confusion about the size of monthly payments. Some people say they are puzzled about why they are being billed at all. One set of borrowers has their payments set to zero because of a new federal repayment option called SAVE that aims to be more generous than any other.
The negotiators begin their conversation at 10 am Eastern time and it will be livestreamed with a chance for the public to weigh in. Here’s what you need to know:  
Biden's new student debt relief plan5 key takeaways from the first day of public input
The process the Biden administration has turned to is called negotiated rulemaking. It has been used many times over the years to draft rules related to higher education, including on how Title IX law on sexual assault is applied at schools and colleges and how well colleges produce graduates whose jobs can cover their student debt.
The people who will hash out the student loan plan applied or were nominated to participate and then were selected by the Education Department. They represent different groups who have a stake in student loans, such as borrowers, student loan servicers and colleges and universities. Some of the members include Wisdom Cole, national director of the NAACP Youth & College Division; Yael Shavit, an assistant attorney general in the Consumer Protection Division of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office; and Jada Stanford, a student at Stephen F. Austin State University in Texas. 
This is a complete list of the committee members, including alternates. 
Their meeting agenda doesn’t give very much away. But the focus of the virtual meeting will be wide-reaching, with discussion reserved for each of the five guiding questions mapped out by the department. 
The questions are described in this issue paper published late last month. They are, in short:
Public comment comes at the end of each day of conversation. To sign up to speak, send your name and, if applicable, organization to negreghearing@ed.gov no later than 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on the day of the meeting. 
The negotiators have to come up with a plan to which each committee member agrees. If they don’t arrive at a consensus, the Education Department will come up with its own proposal. Either way, there will be another opportunity for the public to comment on what is developed before it’s finalized. Congress will then have the opportunity to review the rule, and has the option of passing a joint resolution to overturn it. 
A final rule must be published by Nov. 1 for it to go into effect in July of the following year. This rulemaking schedule is a big reason the Biden administration is so intent on publishing a rule developed under its Education Department. If the process goes according to plan, the earliest borrowers would see forgiveness is summer of 2024. 
When the Supreme Court struck down Biden’s original plan this past summer, it ruled that student loan debt relief could not happen through the president’s executive authorities the way he’d hoped. That means the only viable routes are through Congressional legislation – which given partisan gridlock is all but impossible – or federal higher education policy changes, a.k.a. neg reg. 
If a rule isn’t finalized through this neg reg series and a Republican wins next year’s presidential election, the chances of broad student loan forgiveness becoming reality are even slimmer. 
First, sign up to watch the negotiators discuss policies that could make large-scale loan forgiveness a reality. You’ll need to register at this link. 
The first meeting spans over two days, Tuesday and Wednesday, for five hours each – from 10 am to noon Eastern, then 1 pm to 4 pm.
The next meeting is scheduled for Nov. 6-7, and the one after that for Dec. 11-12. Both of the sessions, like the one that kicks off Tuesday, will be virtual and include opportunities for the public to comment. 
Biden has a Plan Bfor mass student loan forgiveness. It could be excruciatingly long
WASHINGTON — Despite the House being frozen without a speaker, Congress is in for a hectic week as Republicans scramble to find a new leader after the historic ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.
House Republicans have a schedule: They'll meet Tuesday night to hold a candidate forum where prospective speakers will make their pitches to fellow GOP lawmakers. Next, they'll hold a secret vote on a nominee Wednesday night.
It's unclear when the House will hold an official speaker election. But the ongoing war between Israel and Palestinian militants could pressure lawmakers to pick up the pace and elect a new speaker so the House can act on the war, especially if they need to approve humanitarian aid or other crucial measures.
Here’s what to know going into a chaotic week in Congress.
Following McCarthy’s historic ouster as speaker last week, leaving the House virtually powerless, House Republicans went home to decide on next steps to crown a new leader and get the lower chamber moving again.
So far, two GOP lawmakers have emerged as possible successors to McCarthy: House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and House Judiciary Committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.
Scalise was largely expected to run for speaker after McCarthy was removed, given his position as the No. 2 ranking House Republican. The Louisiana lawmaker, who suffered a near-death experience in 2017 after a gunman opened fire at a practice session for the Congressional Baseball Game, has commanded respect from virtually every corner of the House GOP conference.
Jordan, who first came into Congress as a conservative bomb-thrower and was a founding member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has been a close ally of McCarthy and House GOP leadership. Chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, Jordan is currently one of the lawmakers spearheading House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.
Scalise and Jordan have both already received endorsements from GOP lawmakers, revealing House Republicans' dilemma: The conference remains divided, and it’s unclear who can become speaker.
House Republicans will hold a closed-door meeting Tuesday night and host a candidate forum to hear from Scalise, Jordan and other prospective speakers.
Then on Wednesday night, GOP lawmakers will hold an internal secret ballot vote where they decide on a nominee to put forward on the House floor. Under their current rules, a nominee only has to earn a simple majority of votes from the secret ballot.
But even if a candidate emerges victorious as the nominee Wednesday night, lawmakers aren't obligated to support that person. Other officials could still be nominated in the speaker election on the House floor, which could happen anytime following the secret ballot vote.
House Democrats are largely expected to stay out of the process. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Sunday his conference won’t take part in the “Republican civil war.”
“It's not my job at this moment to weigh in to the politics that are taking place in the House Republican Conference, other than to make clear that it's time for the GOP to end the Republican civil war, in order for us to be able to come together in an enlightened and bipartisan way to get things done for everyday Americans,” Jeffries said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
At the same time, as it becomes more clear that no candidate so far can earn the majority of votes needed to become speaker, 217, McCarthy has shown willingness to be reinstated as the lower chamber's leader.
“That’s a decision by the conference,” McCarthy said Monday morning at a press conference reiterating U.S. support for Israel. McCarthy has yet to endorse a candidate for speaker and noted that “96 percent” of House Republicans stood behind him as he attempted to quell the conservative rebellion that ultimately removed him from his post.
The surprise attack by Hamas on Israel over the weekend has added a new dimension to an already unprecedented series of events in the House. Without a speaker, the House is unable to pass any legislation, including emergency aid to Israel, a U.S. ally.
McCarthy on Monday lamented that it was “wrong” for him to be ousted by a sliver of House Republicans – just eight GOP lawmakers voted to remove him – now that the lower chamber is paralyzed as the conflict in Israel unfolds.
“We are living in very dangerous times. The pettiness has got to stop,” McCarthy said.
Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., a moderate GOP lawmaker, has shown support for McCarthy to return to the speakership and decried his removal as “idiotic,” as news broke on Hamas’ attack.
“Removing (McCarthy) from office, mid-term, was idiotic,” Lawler said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “Doing so as Israel faces an all out attack is dangerous. Uncertainty and chaos in the U.S. breeds vulnerability around the world. The House should immediately reinstate McCarthy and stop screwing around.”
But the urgency of the conflict isn't guaranteed to push GOP lawmakers to quickly throw their support behind a new leader. Speaker pro tempore Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., is currently serving in a limited role as acting speaker, and given the historic nature of the situation, it's not clear if McHenry can put any legislation on the House floor.
Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, every House speaker has created a backup list of temporary successors intended to ensure the speakership is never vacant in the case of a catastrophic event. The list has never been used until last week when McCarthy was ousted.
Considering the nature of the backup list, McCarthy suggested McHenry had some sort of power to lead the House and take action on the conflict in the Middle East.
“I know this is new territory. It was created after 9/11. I don’t understand why the speaker pro (tempore) couldn't lead as well,” McCarthy said. “We should have a resolution on the floor condemning what’s taken place so the rest of the world understands, we should supply and make sure that there’s no question and no doubt that Israel will never be overwhelmed when it comes to ammunition.”
Closing arguments are expected to begin Tuesday in the trial of one current and one former Aurora, Colorado, police officer charged in the death of 23-year-old massage therapist Elijah McClain in 2019. The officers have pleaded not guilty to criminally negligent homicide, manslaughter and assault.
In Washington, jurors in the trial of three Tacoma Police Department officers are expected to hear more testimony in the case of 33-year-old Manuel Ellis, who died in 2020 after telling officers multiple times he couldn't breathe during a struggle that was captured on camera. The officers face second-degree murder or first-degree manslaughter charges and have pleaded not guilty.
Meanwhile, in Tennessee, five former Memphis police officers charged in the beating and death of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols in January are waiting to learn when they will stand trial in state court. The officers have pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and other charges in the case.
Across the United States, the number of police officers charged with violent on-duty crimes, including murder, manslaughter and assault, has increased in recent years in part because of increased public scrutiny, new technology and legal changes that have helped make prosecutions possible. Still, such charges for police officers remain rare and convictions are rarer still, data shows.
"There's a demand for criminal prosecution," said Kate Levine, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York. "And so prosecutors are looking to charge police officers when they wouldn't have in the past, and/or because of police bodycams or citizens taking videos, evidence comes up to contradict these claims, where it may not have in the past."
Police kill more than 1,000 people each year, according to databases created by the Washington Post and civil rights organization Campaign Zero.
Since 2005, 185 nonfederal law enforcement officers have been arrested on charges of murder or manslaughter as a result of an on-duty shooting, according to Philip Matthew Stinson, a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio who tracks the criminal arrests of nonfederal police officers.
Stinson's data shows the number of officers charged in on-duty fatal shootings has generally increased, from a low of one in 2011 to a high of 21 in 2021. But Stinson said he doesn't consider that a remarkable shift in part because the number of police killings has also increased in recent years.
According to The Washington Post, fatal police shootings increased from 995 in 2015 to a record high of 1,096 in 2022. The Mapping Police Violence database created by Campaign Zero found police killed a record-high 1,250 people last year, up from 1,099 in 2017.
"The number of officers charged in terms of a percentage has stayed flat, it's still under 2% of the cases ... so from where I sit things have not changed," Stinson said.
Since 2005, 59 officers charged with murder or manslaughter in connection with an on-duty shooting have been convicted of a crime, but only six were convicted of murder, according to Stinson's data. The criminal cases of 45 officers arrested on charges of murder or manslaughter after an on-duty shooting are pending.
The data doesn't reflect officers charged in non-shooting deaths, such as in the deaths of McClain, Ellis, Nichols or George Floyd, who was murdered in Minneapolis in 2020.
What has changed, according to Stinson, is the number of officers arrested for other violent crimes, such as assault. He said the most recent data he has analyzed, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, shows that from 2014 to 2018, there was a significant increase in officers arrested in connection with other on-duty violent crimes.
Stinson said that spike could be the result of an increase in cameras, including cellphone, doorbell and body-worn cameras, as well as increased scrutiny of police use of force sparked by the 2014 killings of Tamir Rice in Ohio and Michael Brown in Missouri, which helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement.
"Their on-duty violence is being more closely scrutinized by prosecutors and their own agencies," Stinson said.
In most cases, on-duty fatal shootings are determined to be legally justified.
On Friday, for example, officials in Georgia announced the state troopers who shot a 26-year-old environmental activist who was protesting the construction of a police and fire training center near Atlanta will not face criminal charges because their use of deadly force was "objectively reasonable."
In Philadelphia, former police officer Mark Dial was initially charged with murder, voluntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, simple assault, reckless endangering of another person, and official oppression in connection with the shooting of 27-year-old Eddie Irizarry on Aug. 14. But last month, a judge agreed with the defense's argument that Dial acted in self-defense and dismissed the charges.
When cases do make it to trial, Stinson said, juries are still "very reluctant to second-guess the split-second decisions of on-duty police officers in potentially violent street encounters."
But as public scrutiny has increased, some states have made changes to laws surrounding the use of deadly force by police.
In 2018, voters in Washington approved Initiative 940, which removed the requirement that prosecutors prove an officer acted with malice before murder charges can be filed − something no other state required. Ellis' case marked the first time the state's attorney general's office criminally charged police officers with the unlawful use of deadly force and the second time an officer has been charged in a homicide in Washington since the change took effect.
"What 940 established doesn't make it easy − I think it's really important to say that − but it establishes the possibility of holding police criminally accountable for negligent behavior," said Martina Morris, a member of the Washington Coalition for Police Accountability.
Seven states also have changed laws governing when police are justified in using deadly force, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. When California in 2019 changed the standard for which a police officer can use deadly force to when it’s “reasonable’’ to when it’s “necessary," Robert Weisberg, law professor and faculty co-director of the Criminal Justice Center at Stanford University in California, told USA TODAY the change moved "the law in the direction of making it more feasible to prosecute officers for homicide."
Abdul Nasser Rad, managing director of research and data at Campaign Zero, said it's still unclear what the impact of those changes has been.
"The jury's still out on that," he said.
Because it can take years for internal investigations and subsequent criminal cases to be resolved, it's difficult to determine whether it's getting easier to prosecute police officers, Rad said.
"I don't think it's fair to say whether it's gotten worse or better. It's such a small number, and there's so many missing values."

Lior Onaly-Kelsey celebrated their 15th birthday two weeks ago. They also celebrated the end of a years-long battle against Greater Albany Public School District.
A federal jury in Eugene this month awarded them $317,353 in damages, concluding the district had discriminated against Onaly-Kelsey when they were in the third grade and failed to properly respond to harassment and bullying.
At a park near their house, Onaly-Kelsey seems happy and curious, eagerly sharing stories about rock climbing and participating in their current school's robotics club.
Their excitement to be a teen attending a Corvallis high school is a stark difference from their emotions as an Albany elementary school student.
A 6-year-old girl with a rare neurological disease recently underwent a 10-hour surgery in California where half of her brain was disconnected in an effort to help cure her.
Brianna Bodley underwent a procedure called a hemispherotomy on Sept. 28 to treat a rare disease called Rasmussen's encephalitis, according to a GoFundMe page created by her mother, Crystal Bodley.
The surgery was performed by Dr. Aaron Robison at Loma Linda University Medical Center in Loma Linda, California. Robison told ABC 7 that "just disconnecting it [the brain] is enough to stop the disease completely and essentially, potentially cure it."
According to the GoFundMe page, Brianna was diagnosed with epilepsy in August 2022 after suffering from nighttime seizures and being hospitalized for five days.
In September 2022, she was once again admitted to the hospital, this time for eight days, and was diagnosed with Rasmussen's encephalitis.
After several seizure medications failed to work, it was recommended that Brianna undergo the operation.
Crystal Bodley said on the GoFundMe page that the entire left side of Brianna's body is "turned off due to disconnecting half of her brain."
WHAT IS BRAIN FOG?:Five expert recommended steps to get rid of brain fog.
According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Rasmussen's encephalitis is a very rare, chronic inflammatory neurological disease that usually affects only one half of the brain.
It most often occurs in children under the age of 10 but can also affect adolescents and adults.
The disease is characterized by frequent and severe seizures, inflammation of the brain, mental deterioration and progressive loss of neurological functions including motor skills, speech and eventual paralysis on one side of the body, according to the NINDS.
A hemispherotomy, the surgery that the young girl went through, involves removing half of the brain's cortex, or outer layer, and the procedure is used "predominantly in children who have seizures that do not respond to medication because of damage that involves only half the brain, as in Rasmussen's encephalitis," according to NINDS.

According to an Oct. 3 update by Crystal Bodley on the GoFundMe page, Brianna was out of the ICU and had been transferred to a normal hospital unit in the children's hospital.
Brianna will then be transferred to inpatient rehab, where she will learn how to walk and use her left arm and undergo speech therapy, according to the update.
Her mother Crystal also has an Instagram page that document's Brianna's journey and road to recovery.
The latest post on Oct. 9 reads: "Pushing through these days trying to learn how to walk again and seeing things that are on her left side. She only sees what's right in front of her and to the right. Everyday we see little progress of her getting better but, still a long journey to go with tons of physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy."

The USA TODAY Opinion section publishes analysis, argument and essays on a wide variety of subjects. We're looking for timeliness (pegged to news), persuasion pitched to the other side, new information, novel arguments, revelatory insights, passion without partisanship, first-person experience, original reporting that reveals fresh angles and makes news, expert knowledge, and/or a topic that will drive conversation on social media and in the real world.
We accept only pieces that are submitted exclusively to USA TODAY. We do not accept material that has been published on blogs, social media or anywhere else.
Columns typically run 550 to 750 words. They should be pasted directly into an email and sent to theforum@usatoday.com. Pieces should include links (URLs, not headlines or footnotes) to back up quotes and factual material. People featured in columns must be identified by their real, full names.
We do not publish open letters, class projects or material that has been submitted to multiple outlets. Rebuttals to editorials and columns published in USA TODAY should be submitted as letters to the editor, not as full-length op-eds.
Due to the volume of submissions, we can’t respond to all columns sent to us. If our Opinion team is interested in yours, you will hear from us within three business days.
Submissions may be edited for accuracy, clarity, style, standards and length. 
Please include with your submission a short biography, two sentences at most, to run at the end of your column, as well as a current photograph, to which you own publishing rights. If you or a business, trade group or other institution with which you are associated stands to gain financially or in any other way from your column, you should disclose that information in detail. In most cases, it should also be included in the body of the piece or in the author's biographical information.
Columns are accepted for online publication; print publication is not guaranteed. All columns published by USA TODAY are available for use online and in print by the more than 250 properties in the USA TODAY Network. They include Austin; Bergen County, New Jersey; Burlington, Vermont; Cincinnati; Columbus, Ohio; Des Moines; Detroit; El Paso, Texas; Indianapolis; Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Milwaukee; Nashville, Tennessee; Phoenix, Reno, Nevada; Palm Beach, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware.
Authors may post their columns elsewhere 48 hours after they are published at USA TODAY. By submitting a column to USA TODAY and agreeing to its publication, authors are granting exclusive rights to the piece to the USA TODAY Network for 48 hours and non-exclusive rights thereafter.
