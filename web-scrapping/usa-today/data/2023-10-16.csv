When Angel Amankwaah traveled from Denver to North Carolina Central University for incoming student orientation this summer, she decided she had made the right choice. 
She had fun learning the chants that fans perform at football games. But she also saw that “there are students who look like me, and professors who look like me” at the historically Black university, said Amankwaah, 18, who is Black. “I knew that I was in a safe space.”
This has in the last two years become an important consideration for college-bound students from all backgrounds and beliefs. With so much attention focused on these issues, USA TODAY and The Hechinger Report present the first-of-its-kind College Welcome Guide showing state laws and institutional policies that affect college and university students, from bans on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and “critical race theory” to rules about guns on campus and whether student IDs are accepted as proof of residency for voting purposes.
The digital tables also list, for every four-year institution in the country, such things as racial and gender diversity among students and faculty, the number of student veterans enrolled, the incidence of on-campus race-motivated hate crimes, free-speech rankings and if the university or college serves many students from rural places.
College Welcome Guide: Test it yourself.These tools new offer a new on campus life
Students have long picked schools based on their academic reputations and social life. But with campuses in the crosshairs of the culture wars, many students are now also taking stock of attacks on diversity, course content and speech and speakers from both ends of the political spectrum. They’re monitoring hate crimes, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, state abortion laws and whether students like them ‒ Black, rural, military veterans, LGBTQ+ or from other backgrounds ‒ are represented and supported on campus.
“There’s no question that what’s happening at the state level is directly affecting these students,” said Alyse Levine, founder and CEO of Premium Prep, a private college admissions consulting firm in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. When they look at colleges in various states now, she said, “There are students who are asking, ‘Am I really wanted here?’”
For some students on both sides of the political divide, the answer is no. In the chaotic new world of American colleges and universities, many say they feel unwelcome at certain schools, while others are prepared to shut down speakers and report faculty with whose opinions they disagree.
It’s too early to know how much this trend will affect where and whether prospective students end up going to college since publicly available enrollment data lags real time. But there are early clues that it’s having a significant impact.
One in 4 prospective students has already ruled out a college or university for consideration because of the political climate in its state, according to a survey by the higher education consulting firm Art & Science Group.
Among students who describe themselves as liberal, the most common reason to rule out colleges and universities in a particular state, that survey found, is because it’s “too Republican” or has what they consider lax gun regulations, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, restrictive abortion laws and a lack of concern about racism. Students who describe themselves as conservative are rejecting states they believe to be “too Democrat” and that have liberal abortion and gay rights laws.
Sixty percent of prospective students of all backgrounds say new state restrictions on abortion would at least somewhat influence where they choose to go to college, a separate poll by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation found. Of these, 8 in 10 say they would prefer to go to a state with greater access to reproductive health services. (Lumina is among the funders of The Hechinger Report, which produced this story.)
“We have many young women who will not look at certain states,” said Levine. One of her own clients backed out of going to a university in St. Louis after Missouri banned almost all abortions following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, she said.
Institutions in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Texas are the most likely to be knocked off the lists of liberal students, according to the Art & Science Group survey. They’re generally most likely to steer clear of the South and Midwest, while conservative students avoid California and New York.
One in 8 high school students in Florida say they won’t go to a public university in their own state because of its education policies, a separate poll, by the college ranking and information website Intelligent.com, found.
With 494 anti-LGBTQ+ laws proposed or adopted this year, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, prospective students who are LGBTQ+ and have experienced significant harassment because of it are nearly twice as likely to say they don't plan to go to college at all compared with students who experienced lower levels of harassment, according to a survey by GLSEN, formerly the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.
“You are attacking kids who are already vulnerable,” said Javier Gomez, an LGBTQ+ student in his first year at Miami Dade College. “And it’s not just queer students. So many young people are fed up.”
It’s not yet evident whether the new laws are affecting where LGBTQ+ young people are choosing to go to college, said Casey Pick, director of law and policy at The Trevor Project, which supports LGBTQ+ young people in crisis. But LGBTQ+ adults are moving away from states passing anti-LGBTQ+ laws, she said. And “if adult employees are taking this into account when they decide where they want to live, you can bet that college students are making the same decisions.”
Since DeSantis takeover,surge in dropouts at New College of Florida
Meanwhile, in an era of pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion policies in many states, and against affirmative action in college admissions nationwide, Amankwaah is one of a growing number of Black students choosing what they see as the relative security of an HBCU. Enrollment at HBCUs increased by around 3% in 2021, the last year for which the figure is available, while the number of students at other universities and colleges fell. 
“The real attack here is on the feeling of belonging,” said Jeremy Young, who directs the Freedom to Learn program at PEN America, which tracks laws that restrict college and university diversity efforts and teaching about race. “What it really does is hoist a flag to say to the most marginalized students, ‘We don’t want you here.’” 
More than 40% of university and college administrators say the Supreme Court ruling curbing the use of affirmative action in admissions will affect diversity on their campuses, a Princeton Review poll found as the school year was beginning.
College students of all races and political persuasions report feeling uncomfortable on campuses that have become political battlegrounds. Those on the left are bristling at new laws blocking programs in diversity, equity and inclusion and the teaching of certain perspectives about race; on the right, at conservative speakers being shouted down or canceled, unpopular comments being called out in class and what they see as an embrace of values different from what they learned at home.
More than 1 in 10 students at four-year universities now say they feel as if they downright don’t belong on their campus, and another 2 in 10 neither agree nor strongly agree that they belong, another Lumina and Gallup survey found. It found that those who answer in these ways are more likely to frequently experience stress and more likely to drop out.
Military veterans who use their GI Bill benefits to return to school say one of their most significant barriers is a feeling that they won’t be welcome, a survey by the D’Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University found. Nearly two-thirds say that faculty and administrators don’t understand the challenges they face, and 70% say the same thing about their non-veteran classmates. 
Colleges should be “safe and affirming spaces,” said Pick, of the Trevor Project ‒ not places of isolation and alienation.
Yet a significant number of students say they don’t feel comfortable sharing their views in class, according to another survey, conducted by College Pulse for the right-leaning Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at North Dakota State University. Of those, 72% say they worry their opinions would be considered unacceptable by classmates and 45%, by their professors. Conservative students are less likely than their liberal classmates to believe that all points of view are welcome and less willing to share theirs. 
“Is that really an intellectually diverse environment?” asked Sean Stevens, director of polling and analytics at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, which has launched a campus free-speech ranking based on students’ perceptions of comfort expressing ideas, tolerance for speakers and other measures. 
“Anecdotally and from personal experience, there’s certainly a pocket of students who are weighing these factors in terms of where to go to college,” Stevens said.
Eighty-one percent of liberal students and 53% of conservative ones say they support reporting faculty who make comments that they find offensive, the same survey found. It used sample comments such as, “There is no evidence of anti-Black bias in police shootings,” “Requiring vaccination for COVID is an assault on individual freedom” and “Biological sex is a scientific fact.”
A professor at Texas A&M University became the subject of an investigation when a student accused her of criticizing the state’s lieutenant governor during a lecture, though she was ultimately exonerated. An anthropology lecturer at the University of Chicago who taught an undergraduate course called “The Problem of Whiteness” said she was deluged with hateful messages when a conservative student posted her photo and email address on social media.
More than half of all freshmen say that colleges have the right to ban extreme speakers, according to an annual survey by an institute at the University of California, Los Angeles; the College Pulse poll says that sentiment is held by twice the proportion of liberal students as conservative ones.
A group of Stanford students in March disrupted an on-campus speech by a federal judge whose judicial record they said was anti-LGBTQ+. When he asked for an administrator to intervene, an associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion confronted him and asked: “Is it worth the pain that this causes and the division that this causes?” The associate dean was put on leave and later resigned. 
“Today it is a sad fact that the greatest threat to free speech comes from within the academy,” pronounced the right-leaning American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which is pushing colleges to sign on to its Campus Freedom Initiative that encourages teaching students about free expression during freshman orientation and disciplining people who disrupt speakers or events, among other measures.
“I have to imagine that universities that have a bad track record on freedom of expression or academic freedom, that it will affect their reputations,” said Steven Maguire, the organization’s campus freedom fellow. “I do hear people saying things like, ‘I’m worried about what kind of a college or university I can send my kids to and whether they’ll be free to be themselves and to express themselves.’”
Some colleges are now actively recruiting students on the basis of these kinds of concerns. Colorado College in September created a program to ease the process for students who want to transfer away from institutions in states that have banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; Hampshire College in Massachusetts has offered admission to any student from New College in Florida, subject of what critics have described as a conservative takeover. Thirty-five have so far accepted the invitation.
Though many conservative critics of colleges and universities say faculty are indoctrinating students with liberal opinions, incoming freshmen tend to hold left-leaning views before they ever set foot in a classroom, according to that UCLA survey.
Fewer than 1 in 5 consider themselves conservative. Three-quarters say abortion should be legal and favor stricter gun control laws, 68% say wealthy people should pay more taxes than they do now and 86% that climate change should be a federal priority and that there should be a clear path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
Prospective students say they are watching as new laws are passed and controversies erupt on campuses and actively looking into not just the quality of food and available majors at the colleges they might attend, but state politics.
“Once I decided I was going to North Carolina Central, I looked up whether North Carolina was a red state or a blue state,” Amankwaah said. (North Carolina has a Democrat as governor but Republicans control both chambers of the legislature and hold a veto-proof supermajority in the state Senate. 
Florida’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws prompted Javier Gomez to leave his native state and move to New York to go to fashion school. But then he came back, transferring to Miami Dade.
“People ask me, ‘Why the hell are you back in Florida?’” said Gomez. “The reason I came back was that there was this innate calling in me that you have to stick around and fight for the queer and trans kids here. It’s overwhelming at times. It can be very mentally depleting. But I wanted to stay and continue the fight and build community against hatred.”

Thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed and Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate from the northern Gaza Strip ahead of Israel's impending ground invasion, leading to a humanitarian crisis that has brought protests from the United Nations and around the world.
The U.N. said about 1 million Gaza residents have been displaced in just a week, about half of them finding refuge in U.N. schools and other facilities where water supplies are diminishing. The war has claimed more than 4,000 lives since Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack Oct. 7.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization pleaded with Israel on Sunday to immediately reverse evacuation orders for hospitals in northern Gaza, saying the deadlines are impossible to meet and risk additional loss of life. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that attacks on health care facilities are already causing deaths and injuries. 
"The health situation in north Gaza is dire," Tedros wrote on social media. "Evacuation orders by Israel to hospitals are practically impossible to implement and are a death sentence for the sick and injured."
Here are several organizations that are providing aid to people caught in the conflict.
How to cope:The videos out of Israel, Gaza are graphic, but some can't look away
The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) is a coalition of more than 170 nongovernmental organizations that includes tens of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis who share the goal of building peace between the two communities.
"Our members are speaking loudly and clearly about the values that unite our community: Opposition to this horrific violence, and a commitment to Israeli/Palestinian partnership on the path to ending it, and achieving peace and equality," the agency said in a statement.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is a humanitarian organization that aims to protect and aid victims of conflicts. The ICRC has been in Israel and the occupied territories since 1967. The organization is asking for donations to improve access to essential services like water and to support livelihood projects.
Doctors Without Borders is a nongovernmental organization that describes itself as an "independent, impartial and neutral" charity that provides humanitarian aid to people affected by conflict, disease outbreaks and natural and human-made disasters.
The agency is seeking donations to continue to provide medical care in the area. The agency has reported overcrowding in hospitals, a lack of medical supplies, and dangerous working conditions as it tries to support the thousands injured by the fighting.
UNRWA has designated shelters to host the estimated 127,000 people displaced in Gaza. The agency is seeking donations to support its work.
The Jewish Agency for Israel North American Council, an American charity organization, is accepting donations to help victims of terrorism.
Save the Children issued an emergency alert in response to the conflict, noting that escalating violence has left 1.2 million children in need of humanitarian aid. The agency is accepting donations.
National and international organizations that aid victims in the conflict include the Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF), which works to provide lifesaving medical relief and humanitarian aid.
Founded by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, in partnership with Emory University, The Carter Center is a humanitarian aid organization that has been promoting peace and a viable two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades.
After Israel declared war, The Carter Center released a statement condemning the targeting of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and called for international action to end the violence.

Families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border under former President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy would receive an easier path to asylum, permission to work in the U.S. and medical, legal and housing benefits, under a settlement filed Monday in a long-standing lawsuit between immigrant advocates and the federal government. 
If approved, the settlement would also expand the total number of families who qualify, from 3,900 to more than 4,400. And it would bar the federal government from launching similar policies in the future. 
The proposed settlement would be one of the first among dozens of lawsuits filed on behalf of families separated by border authorities under the Trump administration. While it would end one case, it doesn’t address monetary compensation for families, which is being sought in other lawsuits.
“Nothing can fully erase the harm the Trump administration inflicted on these little children,” said Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the ACLU and lead counsel in the case, “but this settlement is an important step forward.”
The Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy directed Border Patrol agents to separate young children from their families, as their parents were tried in federal court on misdemeanor charges for crossing into the United States without proper documentation. 
Department of Homeland Security officials initially defended the policy, saying they were abiding by the law – parents entering the country had been charged with a crime, and children couldn’t stay with them. 
But as the numbers mounted, so did public backlash. Children were held in emergency Border Patrol facilities and in a variety of shelter settings overseen by government contractors. Images of separated youths circulated in the media, along with audio and video of toddlers in holding facilities, crying for their parents.
The administration rescinded the policy within months. By then, thousands of children had been taken from their parents, many of whom had already been deported.
In February 2018, as separations ramped up, the ACLU and other advocate groups filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Congolese mother who was separated from her 7-year-old daughter at the border.
That lawsuit, known as Ms. L. v. ICE, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was the basis for a federal judge to order the practice stopped and all families reunited. It grew to become a class-action suit on behalf of all separated families.
Over the years, though, both sides fought over how to tally the true number of families separated by the government – and how best to reunite them. In 2021, President Joe Biden ordered the creation of the Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families to help locate and reunite families. As of October, the task force has helped reunite more than 750 families.
"The Department of Homeland Security has taken steps to ensure that the prior practice of separating families does not happen again, and we are continuing the work of reuniting children with their parents,” Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement.  
Monday’s 46-page settlement proposal, if approved by a court in December, will expand the definition of families separated to include those from the first six months of the Trump administration, during a so-called “pilot program” that predated the full policy. The settlement will also include adults who were not parents but can show they were a child’s legal guardian at the time of separation. These moves open the door to more than 500 more families. 
Advocates believe at least 500 and up to 1,000 children remain separated from their families because of the policy.
Many families separated at the border and later reunited are still awaiting a ruling on their immigration status, said Conchita Cruz, co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project. The settlement would help them through the process faster and grant them work permits while their cases proceed. 
It would also set agreements that would be adhered to for years to come, regardless of who’s in the White House, she said. 
“It impacts all the families that were separated under zero tolerance, including the pilot program,” Cruz said. “This has been a long time coming.”
Even as it settles this case, the federal government continues to fight monetary damages for separated families in a slew of other lawsuits. 
Investigation:Biden said Trump-era family separations were 'abhorrent.' So why is DOJ fighting relief claims?
Though the new settlement does not address monetary payouts, it offers medical and behavioral health services for families, something that immigrant rights activists had been pressing for years. Youths separated from their parents at the border, some of whom were as young as 6 months old, have displayed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, trouble sleeping and anxiety months after returning to their families, according to activists.
A 2021 study by Physicians for Human Rights found that all of the 31 families they reviewed who were forcibly separated at the border exhibited serious psychological disorders, including PTSD, major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder, even years after their separation and regardless of the length of time they were apart.
“We’re going on five years now, and we still have many aspects of our personal and psychological lives that are affected by this,” said Daniel Paz, a native of Honduras who was separated from his 6-year-old daughter, Angie, at the U.S.-Mexico border near El Paso, Texas, in 2018. For years after, Angie suffered from nightmares and panic attacks.
“Day to day, we still relive it,” he said. “Any psychological help for the families will be a blessing. It’s really hard to go through what we went through.”
Migrant children:At age 12, he fled the Taliban to try to save his family. Then he faced years in US custody
Another key part to the settlement is drastically limiting how the government can separate immigrant families in the future. Under the agreement, migrant children would not be separated from their families except for a few limited reasons, such as if the parent or legal guardian poses a threat to the child, or if they’re wanted for a felony. 
“The practice of separating families at the southwest border was shameful,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “This agreement will facilitate the reunification of separated families and provide them with critical services to aid in their recovery." 
All separations must be documented in shared databases between DHS, the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies involved in housing migrants. Also, immigrant attorneys must be promptly notified and allowed to challenge the separations.
The settlement agreement, filed in federal court in San Diego, now goes to U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw for consideration.
Advocates generally applauded the terms of the settlement, while urging the Biden administration to go further and offer a pathway to citizenship and protection from deportation for affected families.“While no settlement could ever fully heal the trauma that these families — and particularly the children — will live with for the rest of their lives, it’s a first step toward moving past that horrific time and ensuring that the large-scale separation of families at the border never happens again,” said Jennifer Podkul, vice president of policy and advocacy at Kids In Need of Defense, an advocacy group.
At a CNN Town Hall meeting in May, Trump said he wouldn’t rule out reimplementing family separations at the southern border if elected president again, saying, “When you have that policy, people don’t come.”
Gelernt, the settlement’s lead counsel, said it was important to have the settlement address the policy itself and prevent it from ever happening again, especially given the prospect of next year’s presidential election.
“It was essential for us not only to help the families who had been separated under the Trump administration but to ensure no future administration repeats this,” he said.
WASHINGTON – U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan set limits Monday on what Donald Trump can say about prosecutors, witnesses and the judge's staff in his election conspiracy case to avoid influencing the jury during trial.
Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith asked for the order to stop Trump’s speeches and statements on social media that attack witnesses, prosecutors and the judge in ways that can sometimes provoke his supporters to threaten violence.
But Trump opposed the order as political interference and a violation of his First Amendment right to speech in the 2024 presidential campaign. Trump also had asked Chutkan to remove herself from the case, which she rejected.
Chutkan ordered Trump not to make or post statements targeting Smith, court staff or witnesses. For example, Trump can no longer call Smith a "thug" or "deranged," she said.
Chutkan said there would be no restrictions on criticism of the Justice Department generally or about his belief the case is politically motivated. But the judge said Trump can’t mount a “smear campaign” against prosecutors and court personnel.
“No other criminal defendant would be allowed to do so, and I’m not going to allow it in this case,” Chutkan said.
Trump announced in a post on Truth Social that he would appeal the decision. He could appeal the decision to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.
Trump's presidential campaign issued a statement calling the decision "an absolute abomination" and "another partisan knife stuck in the heart of our Democracy."
"President Trump will continue to fight for our Constitution, the American people’s right to support him, and to keep our country free of the chains of weaponized and targeted law enforcement," the statement said.
Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, said the bench order appeared narrowly tailored, but enforcing the eventual written order could still become a challenge.
“It leaves a lot of political speech available for former President Donald Trump,” Muller said. “But the details in a future order will be tricky to assess in the months to come. And if the court needs to enforce the order in the future because of an apparent violation, it will be yet another challenge."
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., was at the hearing "to see if Judge Chutkan is really going to destroy the 1st amendment," she said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
Trump is already facing restrictions in his New York civil trial, which is determining damages after Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron had ruled he committed fraud for years in valuing his real estate properties.
The order came after Trump reposted a picture on Truth Social of Engoron's clerk, Allison Greenfield, alleging she was the "girlfriend" of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Engoron ordered participants in Trump's civil trial not to disparage his staffers on social media.
Chutkan's case is one of four criminal trials pending against Trump that could muzzle him during the campaign. If trials are held as scheduled, they could sideline him from the hustings for months at a time and the court order could stifle his prolific posts on social media.
“We have no interest in stopping the defendant from running for office or defending his reputation, nor does our proposed order do this,” senior assistant special counsel Molly Gaston said.
Here is a sample of Trump's posts or statements before requests for gag orders:
Prosecutors argued that a gag order was necessary to prevent Trump from threatening or intimidating witnesses or victims in his case.
“The defendant knows that when he publicly attacks individuals and institutions, he inspires others to perpetrate threats and harassment against his targets,” prosecutors Gaston and Thomas Windom wrote for Smith.
Smith had asked Chutkan on Sept. 15 to limit Trump’s statements and posts outside court filings that contain “prejudicial” statements. Smith warned about potential harm to public officials and intimidation of witnesses.
In August, a Texas woman, Abigail Jo Shry, was charged after she was accused of calling Chutkan’s chambers, addressed her using a racist term and “threatened to kill anyone who went after former President Trump,” according to court records. Shry's trial is set for Oct. 30.
John Lauro, one of Trump’s lawyers, accused prosecutors of “seeking to censor a political candidate in the middle of a campaign.” Lauro said Trump had not violated his pretrial conditions, and those were enough to keep him in check for the future, telling the judge: “What you have put in place is working.”
Chutkan burst out laughing. “I’m going to have to take issue with that,” the judge said, citing Trump's remarks about the jury pool in Washington, Smith and his staff.
“You keep talking about censorship like the defendant has unfettered First Amendment rights. He doesn’t,” Chutkan said. “We’re not talking about censorship here. We’re talking restrictions to ensure there is a fair administration of justice on this case.”
Trump's lawyers had said language in the 45-page indictment "read very much like a campaign press release" that could "poison President Trump's defense." The lawyers argued prosecutors wanted to strip Trump of his First Amendment rights during the presidential campaign.
"The Court should reject this transparent gamesmanship and deny the motion entirely," wrote lawyers Lauro, Todd Blanche, Gregory Singer and Filzah Pavalon.
Trump is fundraising off the dispute. In an email Oct. 4 seeking contributions, Trump said the Justice Department is trying to censor him and is interfering in the 2024 election.
"In other words, in just a few short weeks, Crooked Joe’s weaponized DOJ may very well get away with stripping Biden’s leading opponent (ME) of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech in the 2024 presidential election," Trump wrote.
Fired Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker dropped a bomb in the campus sexual harassment case against him when he and his legal team sent the media a trove of private text messages between the woman who accused him and her deceased assistant.
An Ingham County, Michigan, judge granted the woman – prominent rape survivor and activist Brenda Tracy – an emergency restraining order the next day, temporarily barring Tucker, his attorney and their associates from releasing more. A hearing Tuesday will determine whether the order should hold.
Tucker’s attorney touted the messages as evidence that Tracy had fabricated her allegations against Tucker. On social media, some echoed his claims, including a sports director for a TV news station in Lansing, Michigan, who proclaimed the texts proved Tracy had lied. The station fired her the next day and apologized to Tracy.
While the messages may have already damaged Tracy’s reputation in the court of public opinion, three of the nation’s top legal experts on Title IX and sexual abuse said the texts do not exonerate Tucker, who was accused by Tracy of masturbating over the phone without her consent.
Context, the experts consulted by USA TODAY said, is everything – and so far that context is missing from the subset of messages released.
“This is (Tucker’s) advocate’s presentation of a set of facts, so of course they are presented in what they hope will be the best light for Mr. Tucker,” said Patrick Mathis, an attorney and co-founder of Title IX Solutions, a consulting firm schools hire to conduct investigations and provide training and support.
“Would they stand the test of the (harassment case) decision-maker asking questions about them? Would they stand the test of seeing these comments and texts in a bigger text chain? Maybe not,” Mathis said. “It may look completely different.”
The texts released on Oct. 5 came from the cellphone of Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s friend of two decades and, more recently, her booking assistant, who died following a car crash in June. Among other things, the messages show that Tracy dated a coach who had hired her years earlier and that she was struggling financially when she filed a complaint against Tucker – all of which Tucker and his attorney called “key evidence” in the sexual harassment case.
Tracy’s civil lawsuit seeking the restraining order said the phone also contains confidential business records, personal information and highly sensitive discussions regarding sexual abuse survivors who interacted with her nonprofit, Set The Expectation. The judge’s order granting the request said Tucker appeared to have obtained the messages illegally.
Tucker’s attorney appears to have gained access to the cellphone through Alvarado’s widowed husband or another family member. According to Tracy’s lawsuit, Alvarado and her husband – Agustin Alvarado – were estranged and divorcing. It alleges he stole the phone from her estate.
The texts raise reasonable questions about whether Tracy’s story is as “clean” as initially portrayed, said David Ring, a California attorney who frequently represents victims of sexual harassment and abuse. But most speak primarily to Tracy’s character and personal life, he said, and only loosely relate to her allegations.
“All of this is a power play by Tucker to one, intimidate her; two, try to get her to back down; and three, make Michigan State think twice about trying to fight Tucker” in court, Ring said.
“I want to be so clear on this: None of these text messages that were released somehow prove Mel Tucker is innocent,” Ring added. “At the end of the day, all these text messages might be much ado about absolutely nothing.”
For the texts to be considered in the campus case, Tucker would have to appeal the school’s decision and ask to admit them as evidence, a process that cannot start until the hearing officer issues her findings.
Three things could stand in his way.
Confidential and privileged information is generally only admissible in Title IX cases if the party who owns it consents to its release, Mathis said. If Ingham County Judge Wanda Stokes determines the messages are confidential or privileged, they might not be admissible in the university case without Tracy’s consent.
To admit new evidence on appeal, Tucker also must demonstrate it was unavailable when the decision was made and that it could affect the outcome, according to the school’s sexual harassment policy.
And Michigan State could determine that the messages are irrelevant because they are tangential to the central facts of the case, the experts said. Even if the school admits the texts, it could assign them little weight.
The phone call at the center of the sexual harassment case took place in April 2022, after Tucker had hired Tracy to speak to his football team about sexual misconduct prevention. Tracy said that by then, Tucker had pursued her romantically for months.
The fact that she was a university vendor, with an ongoing business relationship with the school, underpins both the college’s decision to investigate her complaint and the athletic director’s decision to fire Tucker on Sept. 18 – just over a week after Tracy went public with her allegations in a USA TODAY investigation.
Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivor
Tucker denies sexually harassing Tracy but does not deny masturbating during the call. In his version of events, he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex.” That admission alone, athletic director Alan Haller said, was sufficient grounds for termination.
Tracy filed a complaint with the university’s Title IX office in December. The outside attorney the school hired to investigate completed her fact-finding investigation in July. A formal hearing took place over Zoom on Oct. 5 before a second outside attorney, who has until Oct. 25 to determine whether Tucker likely violated Michigan State's policy barring sexual harassment and exploitation.
Tucker and his attorney did not show up to the Oct. 5 hearing, saying Tucker couldn’t participate because of a “serious medical condition.” Instead, 14 minutes in, they emailed the media an eight-page letter addressed to the university’s interim president and Board of Trustees and 98 heavily redacted pages of Tracy’s text messages with Alvarado. The letter also said they had obtained testimony from a new witness they declined to name.
Tucker, his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, and Alvarado’s husband have not returned phone calls and messages. On Sunday, Tracy spoke to USA TODAY about Tucker and Belveal’s claims and shared additional context around the messages.
“These texts have nothing to do with the case,” Tracy told USA TODAY. “Tucker has had his opportunities to comply with MSU’s process, and he has refused to do so.”
Tucker’s letter said the texts show Tracy had “simultaneous consensual personal relationships” with Tucker and a basketball coach.
In fact, while the texts indicate Tracy had a romance with a basketball coach, they do not show she had a romantic relationship with Tucker.
Tracy told USA TODAY she has been friends with the basketball coach since the 1990s and went on a few dates. She dated him again briefly in 2021.
“I have known him for many years and did not meet him through work,” Tracy told USA TODAY. “Tucker had no right to violate his privacy. Out of respect for (the coach), I’m not going to comment on this.”
Evidence and questions about a complainant’s sexual history are prohibited under MSU’s sexual harassment policy. And outing Tracy’s private relationship in a press release naming the man is unnecessarily vindictive, said Diane Rosenfeld, an attorney and founding director of the Gender Violence Program at Harvard Law School.
“That shows real desperation, as does the idea that they would skip the hearing and then, in the middle of the hearing, do this press release,” Rosenfeld said. “It’s just a publicity tactic.”
Belveal also wrote in the letter to the school that Tracy’s relationship with the basketball coach contradicts what she had previously told Tucker: that she does not date coaches. Tracy “repeatedly made these bold claims to falsely suggest that her relationship with Tucker was necessarily one-sided,” Belveal wrote.
The investigation report, however, does not indicate Tracy made that claim to the investigator. Rather, the report shows it was what she said she told Tucker when he asked during a November 2021 phone call if she would date him.
If Tracy merely recounted the interaction with Tucker to the investigator, it would not necessarily speak to her credibility, as Belveal claims, Mathis said.
“She could have just said that because she was trying to dissuade him from pursuing a relationship,” Mathis said. “That’s why I think the context of the actual interview is important.”
Tucker’s press release, Rosenfeld said, is the latest instance of his use of DARVO – Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. It’s a tactic that those accused of sexual misconduct employ to influence juries and public opinion. Research has found it effective with those unfamiliar with it.
A close cousin of DARVO is the “nuts and sluts” defense, which Tucker and his legal team have also invoked, Rosenfeld said. It plays on common prejudices people have about victims, including that they are crazy, promiscuous or gold-diggers.
“It all becomes about her, and it’s never about him,” Rosenfeld said. “When we put the focus on her all the time, we’re never going to hold the perpetrators accountable.”
Tucker’s letter also raises the specter of a new witness who it claims has come forward with explosive evidence.
It says the witness stated in a sworn affidavit that Tracy and Tucker had consensual phone sex and had been in “some sort of relationship” at the time.
The letter didn’t disclose the person’s name, though in a footnote Belveal said Tucker would make the affidavit available to the Board of Trustees to review “should they desire to discuss this matter.”
If Tucker is serious about trying to admit this person as a witness in the case, that person will need to be interviewed by the investigator and cross-examined at a hearing, Mathis said. Until then, he said, it’s not really evidence.
“I don’t put much stock in it,” Mathis said. “Making a bare statement that there’s someone out there that is making these statements, to me, doesn’t carry much weight.”
According to the letter, the new witness also said that Tracy slept over at Alvarado’s house after her death and repeatedly asked family members for access to her phone and computers. Belveal wrote that this proved that Tracy intended to erase Alvarado’s phone to conceal evidence.
Tracy told USA TODAY that she asked for access to Alvarado’s computer for the same reason she filed for the restraining order: Because Alvarado was her employee, the computer contained business records she needed. Tracy said she did not intend to delete anything.
As for the phone, Tracy said she did not want to access it herself; she said she had raised concerns with Alvarado’s family members about whether Alvarado would want her husband, from whom she was separated, to have access to it.
“Even after her death,” Tracy said, “my friend has a right to privacy.”
One of the more damning text exchanges, Belveal maintained in her letter, was one in which Tracy told her assistant that she would ask Tucker to finance a documentary project through her nonprofit.
“I’m gonna ask him to finance the doc part of it,” Tracy wrote in the Nov. 26, 2021 message. “He’ll do it.”
Earlier in the same conversation, Tracy mentioned the $95 million contract extension Tucker had signed with Michigan State that week. Those messages, Belveal wrote in the letter, show Tracy “had long been focused on counting Mr. Tucker’s money and was plotting to get some of it herself.”
Tracy told USA TODAY the project is a video-based learning curriculum her nonprofit has been building for several years. They planned to film engaging, documentary-style videos for the program, which she hoped teams and schools would adopt.
“Tucker on multiple occasions pledged to support my nonprofit financially and with resources, including introductions to people and companies,” Tracy said. “Tucker was just one of the people we are asking to support this project.”
Belveal also wrote in the letter that the texts contradicted another of Tracy’s statements to the investigator: that she would not accept gifts from Tucker after knowing he was romantically interested in her.
The investigation report, however, tells a different story. It shows Tracy told the investigator that she did not accept any “personal gifts” after Tucker asked her if she would date him.
Tracy also specifically distinguished between personal and nonprofit gifts, the report shows, noting she accepted a $2,500 donation Tucker made to her nonprofit in 2022 “because that was not a personal gift.”
Money also was at the heart of Tracy’s harassment complaint, Belveal’s letter maintains – a way to manipulate Tucker and the university for her own financial gain. Belveal cites texts in which Tracy discusses the prospect of settling the matter with Tucker or the school for money.
“Money is my only recourse to make him feel like there is a punishment,” Tracy wrote to Alvarado. “When they do the money I should make him pay me 10k directly.”
Tracy told USA TODAY the “10k” refers to the $10,000 speaking fee she lost out on when Tucker abruptly canceled her planned July 2022 campus visit to provide anti-sexual violence training to the football team. Tracy told the investigator she believes Tucker’s inappropriate behavior was the real reason for the cancellation.
In other texts, Tracy mentioned her own difficult financial straits, saying that her bank account was down to $5. Tracy has long dealt with financial hardships, including filing for bankruptcy in 2010.
“Any financial issues I’ve had have nothing to do with what he did to me or what I reported him for,” Tracy told USA TODAY. “He’s offered me money before and I have turned him down and not countered.”
It’s common for people who have been injured or harmed to discuss resolving the matter outside of court or the Title IX process, said Mathis, or for money to factor into the considerations. If the harassment occurred, he added, Tracy’s motivation for reporting it is irrelevant.
Belveal also argued that Tracy contemplating a financial settlement contradicted a statement she made to the investigator. According to the investigation report, Tracy told the investigator during a June 2023 follow-up interview that she had not mentioned money once in connection with Tucker’s behavior.
The investigation report does not capture the full context of what she said in her interview, according to Tracy. She says she was telling the investigator about two settlement offers Tucker and Belveal had proposed to her in January and March 2023 – after she filed her complaint but before Tucker sat down with the investigator for his interview.
What she told the investigator, she said, is that she never discussed money with Tucker and Belveal – a statement she stands by. In private conversations with her attorney and her friend, Tracy said she considered all avenues for a resolution and ultimately decided against settling, declining both of Tucker’s proposals.
Based on Tracy’s explanation, Rosenfeld said Tracy’s statement is “not really even an inconsistency.” To the extent the hearing officer might perceive it as a credibility concern, Rosenfeld said, she would have to weigh that against the numerous contradictions in Tucker’s accounts.
USA TODAY previously reported that Tucker changed his story and repeatedly misled the investigator about key facts, including his location during the April 2022 phone call – he said he was home but records showed he was in Florida on a university-sponsored trip – and why he canceled Tracy’s July 2022 visit.
“If you just apply common sense, who’s more credible in the situation?” Rosenfeld said. “I think (Tracy) wins on the common sense, hands down.”

As President Joe Biden considers traveling to Israel in a show of solidarity, about 2,000 U.S. troops have been told to get ready to deploy in anticipation of an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza aimed at crushing the Hamas militant group that rules the war-battered enclave.
The American soldiers would not be sent to Israel but could be assigned to other countries in the region for support roles such as medical assistance or providing security at gate crossings, the Associated Press reported Monday, citing U.S. officials.
Later in the day, Hamas said it's holding 200 to 250 hostages − the upper end is about 50 more than previously believed − and added that it would release the non-Israeli ones when it was feasible.
Also Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Iran and Hezbollah not to interfere in his country's military actions prompted by Hamas' brutal killing rampage into Israel nine days ago. Netanyahu spoke at an Israeli parliamentary session that required a 40-minute break when rockets fired on Jerusalem forced attendees to take cover in bomb shelters.
“Don’t test us in the north. Don’t make the mistake of the past," Netanyahu said, referring to the 2006 war with Hezbollah. "Today, the price you will pay will be far heavier."
Hezbollah later said its fighters targeted five Israeli posts along the Lebanese border Monday afternoon.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to Israel on Monday − his second visit in less than a week − after a whirlwind tour of six Arab states aimed at keeping the war from expanding across the Middle East. Blinken met with Netanyahu, reaffirming U.S. determination to provide Israel whatever is needed to protect its citizens, Blinken said in a statement.
The two also discussed coordination with the U.N. and "regional partners" to provide humanitarian aid to civilians as well as the U.S. commitment to the speedy release of hostages, Blinken said. Their meeting was interrupted twice by air raid sirens indicating incoming rockets, prompting them and others to seek shelter in a bunker.
No spillover:Blinken says Arab leaders don't want spillover from Israel-Hamas war
Developments:
∎ A senior Biden administration official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said Biden was pondering a trip to Israel. Biden abruptly called off a trip to Colorado but made no announcement of alternative travel plans.
∎ More than 1 million Gazans have evacuated their homes. Last week Israel ordered an evacuation of northern Gaza, an edict that fueled chaos across the Israeli-occupied territory of about 2.3 million Palestinians.
∎ The Israeli military has ordered people living in 28 communities near the Lebanese border to evacuate amid increasing cross-border fire between Israel and the Lebanese Shiite militia, Hezbollah.
∎ The European Union said it has tripled humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza to nearly $80 million and will send two flights this week through Egypt with provisions for the territory's residents.
∎ Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ordered the current invasion of neighboring Ukraine that has killed tens of thousands and led to war crime charges against him, urged Netanyahu to seek “a peaceful settlement through political and diplomatic means,” the Kremlin said.
What’s happening in Israel?After Hamas attack, understanding the conflict in Gaza
The head of Israel's domestic security agency took responsibility for the failure to thwart the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught that claimed more than 1,400 lives.
"We were unable to create enough early warning to prevent the attack,” Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar said in a letter to agency employees. “As the person at the head of the organization, the responsibility for that is on me. There will be time for investigation – now is a time for war.”
Shin Bet, which monitors Palestinian extremists, is one of thee major Israeli security agencies along with Mossad and Aman.
Abnormal activity detected in Gaza the night before the massacre prompted Bar to send a small team to the border, not realizing the huge scope of Hamas' planned attack, the Israeli news site Ynet reported. Shin Bet said at least 10 of its members were killed by Hamas forces.
Almost 300 Floridians who had been trapped in Israel because of flight cancellations have arrived in Florida on a flight arranged by the state and the global rescue agency Project Dynamo. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, took a dig at the Biden administration, saying he was "proud of how quickly we have been able to activate resources and do what the federal government could not – get Floridians and other Americans back home, reunited with their families, free of charge.”
DeSantis said the state also is sending medical supplies, hygiene products, clothing and children’s toys to Israel to help Israelis affected by the war. And he said Gazans should not be welcomed into the U.S., saying Arab nations should "open their borders and absorb" Gaza refugees.
"As president, the number of people I will bring in from Gaza is zero," he said.
The death toll on both sides of the war has surpassed 4,000, and thousands more are wounded. At least 199 people were being held hostage in Gaza, Israeli officials said.
The U.S. death toll rose to 30, and the State Department said 13 Americans remained missing but could provide no count on the number of U.S. hostages. "State Department personnel have been in contact with their families," a spokesperson said.
Thieves using trucks purportedly from the Gaza Health Ministry have stolen desperately needed fuel and medical supplies from a U.N. agency compound in Gaza City, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency says. The agency was forced to evacuate the compound Friday and has no access to the site. Security cameras at the entrance and exit to the compound were damaged, the agency said.
"@UNRWA fuel & other types of material are kept for strictly humanitarian purposes − any other use is strongly condemned," the agency said in a social media post.
Palestinians crowded into hospitals and schools Monday as supplies of food, water and medicine ran low during a tight Israeli blockade of Gaza. Some relief was not far away but still unreachable.
Trucks carrying necessities have waited for days at the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt amid negotiations for a cease-fire that would allow them to enter Gaza and allow foreigners to leave. Gaza’s only border link to Egypt was shut down several days ago following Israeli airstrikes.
"The conflict in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory is an awful reminder of how quickly the health of millions of people can be put at risk," World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a social media post. "War will bring nothing but destruction and horror."
The Justice Department opened a federal hate-crimes investigation into the Illinois stabbing death of 6-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian American boy. His mother, Hanaan Shahin, 32, was seriously injured in the attack.
Their landlord, Joseph Czuba of Plainfield Township, about 40 miles southwest of Chicago, is facing murder and hate crime charges, Czuba, 71, was denied bail at a court hearing Monday and must remain behind bars.
Czuba was charged Sunday with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and two counts of a hate crime for what authorities believe was a targeted attack against a Muslim family in response to the Israel-Hamas war, according to the Will County Sheriff's office.
The alleged assault has evoked fears among Arab Americans of possible reprisals stemming from the war.
“No one in the United States of America should have to live in fear of violence because of how they worship or where they or their family come from,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in announcing the hate crime investigation.

Stabbing death of 6-year-old Muslim boy:llinois incident to be investigated as hate crime
The national average for a gallon of gas fell last week despite a tumultuous period for oil prices after Hamas launched the attack on Israel. A gallon of regular unleaded fell about 12 cents to $3.628 on Friday, according to AAA, a nonprofit federation of motor clubs that tracks fuel costs. The decline comes even as oil rose by about $5 to around $90 per barrel last week. The price of crude, which is refined into gasoline, makes up more than half the price of a gallon of fuel. The cost at the pump is dropping because of lower demand from drivers and less expensive blends of winter gasoline coming into the market, AAA says.
“As long as this war does not spread to include more countries in the region, the effect on the oil market will remain muted,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a statement. Read more here.

Numerous organizations are attempting to provide assistance to civilians in need on both sides of the confrontation. The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) is a coalition of over 170 non-governmental organizations that includes tens of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis who share the goal of building state peace between the two communities. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also aims to protect victims of conflicts and provide them with assistance. And Doctors Without Borders is a non-governmental organization that provides humanitarian aid to people affected by conflict, disease outbreaks and natural and human-made disasters.

Health situation is 'dire':Groups providing aid as Israeli-Palestinian crisis worsens
Hamas has been responsible for numerous suicide bombings and other deadly attacks in Israel since the militant group was formed in 1987. On Oct. 7, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea. Hamas says the attack was partially a response to Israeli police activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The Jerusalem mosque is located on a holy site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.
But Hamas leaders also blame unrelenting Israeli crackdowns and a 16-year blockade in Gaza and the West Bank, continued construction of Israeli settlements − which the international community considers illegal − and Israel's tight military control of Gaza.
Also, the attack came amid thawing relations between some Arab nations and Israel. Hamas refuses to recognize Israel, and the attack and Israel's harsh response could slow or derail those diplomatic overtures.
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, a decade after its founding. Several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
In 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.
Hamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.

BRIDGEVIEW, Ill. – Hundreds of mourners gathered for the funeral Monday afternoon of Wadea Al-Fayoume, the 6-year-old boy stabbed to death Saturday in what authorities say was a violent and ugly response to the Israel-Hamas war.
Wadea and his mother, Haanan Shahin, 32, were attacked Saturday. The boy was stabbed at least 26 times. His mother, who was stabbed at least a dozen times, survived.
His death has led many in the Arab-American community to worry about whether more violence will come their way. Wadea and his mother are Palestinian American.
Outside the Mosque Foundation, which was established nearly 70 years ago in this Chicago suburb, hundreds of people, some of them bearing Palestinian flags, pleaded for action. At times, wailing pierced the gathering.
Billboards mounted on trucks projected a picture of Wadea, wearing a birthday hat, along with messages including “Urge President Biden to condemn anti-Palestinian bigotry unreservedly” and “Dehumanization Through Propaganda Breeds Hate Crimes.” 
Joseph Czuba, 71, of Plainfield Township, about 40 miles southwest of Chicago, was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and two counts of hate crime according to the Will County Sheriff's Office. Attorney General Merrick Garland has announced a federal hate crimes investigation.
“No one in the United States of America should have to live in fear of violence because of how they worship or where they or their family come from,” Garland said in his announcement of the federal investigation. Authorities in Dearborn, Michigan, also announced they arrested 41-year-old Carl Mintz on Thursday after he was accused of threatening Palestinian residents through a social media post, police said.
Bridgeview Mayor Steven Landek and other officials spoke outside the center. Landek called upon non-Muslims to support their fellow residents.
When the mosque doors opened for Wadea’s service, the crowd split, men upstairs, women downstairs. They removed their shoes and packed the prayer room, leaving some mourners to watch TV screens in the carpeted hallways. 
“He is not the only one … being slaughtered," said Sheikh Jamal Said, who presided over Wadea's service. “The Palestinians aren’t going nowhere. … No one can force them out.”
Federal investigation:Stabbing death of 6-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois to be investigated as hate crime
The attack on Wadea and Shahin came at their home, the ground floor of Czuba’s house, and was reported as a stabbing between a landlord and a tenant.
Inside, Wadea and Shahin were discovered with more than a dozen stab wounds. Czuba was found sitting on the ground near the driveway. The mother and son were rushed to a local hospital in critical condition. Wadea died Sunday, but his mother was expected to survive, law enforcement said.
Czuba didn't answer questions, but law enforcement determined he stabbed the woman and her child "due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis," the sheriff's office said.
At a news conference Sunday, the Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the boy and mother had lived at the home owned by Czuba two years with no reported problems.
But according to text messages between Shahin and the boy's father that were shared with the Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Czuba yelled "You Muslims must die" during the attack.
In an autopsy Sunday, the weapon, a 12-inch serrated military-style knife, was removed from the boy's abdomen, the sheriff's office said.
Ground Zero for the Hamas attacks:Here is how the police and military are trying to find the gunmen.
Wadea's death has many in the Muslim community worried about safety.
Areej Samara, 29, a business owner in the Chicago area, said hearing about Wadea's murder brought back the trauma of growing up as a Muslim-American after 9/11.
"It's almost like this feeling we have of waking up in the morning and saying, 'What else do we have to prove to the world that we are not today?" Samara told USA TODAY.
"We're not monsters. Our kids have dreams and hopes just like other kids, and for that fear to follow us in our own backyard is just a different kind of unsettling feeling."
Also in Chicago, 33-year-old Humera Syed said her 2-year-old's Islamic school sent a message alerting parents of increased security measures in response to the escalation of violence between Israel and Hamas.
"Obviously, it's not only my school, but I know there are other Islamic schools around the area that have done the same," Syed told USA TODAY. "It is hitting very hard in our community, and they're trying to obviously protect the children however they can."
Syed said she was disheartened by the feeling that anti-Muslim sentiment was returning.
"It's just unfortunate that it's history repeating itself again, the dehumanization of Palestinians and Muslims," she said. "It's just hard to walk around thinking that these people have this feeling towards us again."
Wesam Shahed, a Palestinian attorney and Chicago Muslim community leader, was 3 years old when his family moved to the Plainfield area with his mother and two brothers.
News of Saturday's attack was compounded by the loss of six members of his family in Gaza, he said.
"How do you balance mourning with this kind of energy of making sure that the community is staying together and protecting itself?" Shahed asked.
Rasha Mubarak, 38, a Palestinian American activist from Orlando, said the community was "devastated and disturbed and mortified" to hear of Wadea's death.
"This is exactly what we warned people about," she told USA TODAY, referring to an increase in hate crimes against Palestinians and Muslims. She added that her community is now not only mourning deaths of children in the Middle East but on American soil.
"The fear is real and natural."
In the face of grief at home and abroad, Shahed said he hopes members inside and outside the Muslim community reach out to their friends and loved ones. "I would say to others, please check in with your brothers and sisters, your friends and allies who are facing this and share the love during this time," he said. "It really does make a world of a difference."

Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy Sunday and plans to close an untold number of stores across the United States as it battles slumping sales and a slew of opioid lawsuits.
One of the largest pharmacy chains in the country, Rite Aid has in recent years struggled to keep up with bigger drugstore chains like CVS and Walgreens as it faces legal hurdles related to accusations that it helped fuel the raging opioid epidemic.
Rumors of its impending plans to file for bankruptcy began circulating at the end of August amid the company’s mounting billions of dollars of debt, declining sales and more than a thousand federal, state and local lawsuits claiming it filled thousands of illegal prescriptions for painkillers.
Here’s what you need to know about the filing, the legal woes and Rite Aid’s plans to stay afloat.
Boo Buckets:McDonald's brings back its Boo Buckets for Halloween this week
The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New Jersey. 
The Chapter 11 filing means Rite Aid plans to stay in business while restructuring its debts through a court-controlled process. Rite Aid even said in a Sunday statement that it has raised $3.45 billion in financing from lenders as it continues to operate its stores while in bankruptcy.  
When the company last filed a financial report in June, it had $3.3 billion in debt, compared to the $135.5 million in cash it had on hand. 
In the statement about Chapter 11 filing, Rite Aid laid out a restructuring plan that includes closing underperforming stores. 
UAW Strikes:How does autoworker union pay compare to other hourly jobs?
Founded in 1962, Philadelphia-based Rite Aid is one of the largest pharmacy chains in the nation with more than 2,000 stores in 17 states.
Most customers won’t have to worry about the bankruptcy filing disrupting their ability to shop or fill prescriptions at their local stores — unless, of course, that store is now slated to close. Rite Aid, which has closed several stores in recent months, said in its media release that it's preparing to close more.
"Rite Aid regularly evaluates its store portfolio to ensure it is operating efficiently while meeting the needs of its customers, communities and associates," the company said in a statement. "These efforts will further reduce the company’s rent expense and are expected to strengthen its overall financial performance."
Joy Errico, a spokesperson for Rite Aid, declined to release further information about how many stores were slated to close or what the timeline for closures would be when reached Monday morning by USA TODAY.
Rite Aid said in the statement that it will communicate with customers of stores that will be closing and ensure they are able to get access to the services they need at other nearby locations. Employees at closing stores will also be transferred "where possible," Rite Aid said.
Rite Aid plans to use the bankruptcy to resolve its legal disputes and also sell some of its businesses, including prescription benefit manager Elixir Solutions that it bought in 2015 for $2 billion.
As part of the bankruptcy plan, Rite Aid appointed on Sunday a new CEO to lead restructuring, Jeff Stein, who will also serve as a member of its board. Elizabeth Burr had been serving as interim CEO since January and will remain on the company’s board, Rite Aid said.
Stein, the founder of financial advisory firm Stein Advisors, said in a statement the company plans to remain in business for the long term.
“My priorities will include overseeing the actions now underway to strengthen the company’s financial position and further advance its journey to reach its full potential as a modern neighborhood pharmacy,” Stein said in the statement. “I have tremendous confidence in this business and the turnaround strategy that has been developed in recent months.”
Inflation:How inflation is reshaping what employees need from their benefits
Rite Aid's legal troubles related to its alleged role in the nationwide deadly abuse of opioids only further contributed to its mounting debt.
The many lawsuits filed against Rite Aid accuse the company of knowingly filling prescriptions for the addictive painkillers that did not meet legal requirements. In March, the Justice Department filed a complaint against Rite Aid asserting that it violated the Controlled Substances Act by filling prescriptions for excessive quantities of prescription pain killers that had “obvious red flags.” 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the rise in U.S. opioid overdose deaths can be tied to the uptick in opioid prescriptions starting in the 1990s. Drug overdose deaths from prescription opioids jumped from 3,442 in 1999 to 16,706 in 2021, according to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Suzanne Somers has died at the age of 76, and the loss has been felt among fans around the world.
"Devastated to hear about the passing of Suzanne Somers," @marc_k011 wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. "A true icon and overall amazing human being."
"I'm truthfully devastated with the death of Suzanne Somers. She was a great actress, but had a deeper heart in life," @MichaelKerner20 wrote. "She was a sweetheart!!!"
Grief is different for everyone, and experts say mourning someone you didn't personally know − a phenomenon called collective or public grief − is a complicated, yet valid, experience.
"Collective and public grief, as I call it, is always unique in how we attach," David Kessler, grief expert and founder of Grief.com, previously told USA TODAY.
This form of grief can be further compounded when the death of a beloved public figure is read about unexpectedly in the news.
"When people experience sudden loss, they may feel shocked, disbelief, confused, and even in denial," Shavonne Moore-Lobban, licensed psychologist, previously told USA TODAY. "The suddenness of the loss may be too much to process and feel too unreal for a person to immediately grasp."
More:Suzanne Somers, star of 'Three's Company' and 'Step by Step,' dead at 76
Somers' longtime publicist, R. Couri Hay, shared a statement on behalf of the actress' family with the news Sunday. The actress, who "survived an aggressive form" of breast cancer for over 23 years, "passed away peacefully at home in the early morning hours" on Sunday," the statement read.
"Sudden loss can be more shocking and people can feel less 'prepared' than they might with expected loss," Moore-Lobban added. "However, it is still hard to prepare for anything that is life-altering, whether a person knew it was coming."
More:The Titanic submersible passengers have died. It's OK to grieve.
Many have parasocial relationships with those in the public eye, be it celebrities, politicians, news anchors. You feel close to them like they're your friend or relative.
Just because collective or public grief doesn't match how one might grieve someone close to them, that doesn't make the experience any less real.
"It's a fascinating thing that people don't realize we really can grieve people we didn't know," Kessler added. "And it doesn't mean we're going to grieve them like our spouse or mother, father, or sister or child, but we will grieve them."

If you're trying to comfort someone going through loss, don't try to minimize it or put a timetable to the grieving process.
"There is no limit to grief and because it is a cycle or process, it will continue as long as it needs to for the person who is experiencing it," Moore-Lobban said.
If you're going through loss yourself, talk about it. This "might mean acknowledging it and being open with someone you trust, about how you are feeling," Moore-Lobban said. "It might also include engaging in therapy with a mental health provider, which can be individual or group therapy. Talking about it can also occur by writing, meaning a person can journal about how they feel and what they are thinking."
The deaths of public figures may also serve as opportunities to widen discussions on grief.
"We have a relationship with death that we don't quite know how to explore as a society," Kessler said. "I always tell people the death rate is 100%. So we know we're all going to die someday, intellectually, but we don't know, is death the great enemy? Is it the great comforter, when we're in pain? We sort of don't know how to hold it."

Disney turns 100 Monday, so hopefully Mickey Mouse, Snow White, Buzz Lightyear, Moana, Cruella de Vil and the Hulk are blowing out the candles on one extremely large birthday cake.
On Oct. 16, 1923, Walt Disney was a fledgling filmmaker in LA when he signed a distribution deal for a series of live-action/animated comedy shorts about a girl in a cartoon world based on "Alice in Wonderland," and the company was born. Originally called Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, Walt and sibling Roy Disney soon changed it to what we all know: the Walt Disney Studio.
A century later, the Mouse House has given us, of course, Mickey (who debuted in the 1928 short "Steamboat Willie") but also countless characters, movies, TV shows and theme parks, making Disney a part of pretty much everyone's life at some point.
Disney has created the celebratory short film "Once Upon a Studio," now streaming on Disney+ and featuring many of the company's iconic personalities assembling for the mother of all group photos. But we're also digging into our own Disney history to shout out some of our favorite things:
Generations have grown up with the classic Disney animated movies, dating back to 1937's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." And another one is on the way: "Wish," starring Oscar winner Ariana DeBose, is a culmination of the Disney 100 celebration.
In recent years, though, Disney has reached back into the vault and revamped its most legendary movies with live-action redos for today's kiddos. They haven't all been winners – looking directly at you, "Alice Through the Looking Glass" – but standouts like "Cruella," "Cinderella" and "Maleficent" have added nuance to familiar tales and characters.
'The Little Mermaid':A definitive ranking of the Disney live-action remakes
What do you get with a classic Disney movie? A classic Disney song. Everyone from Elton John to Christina Aguilera has contributed to the Mouse House's musical canon, and the company still commands the best talent. For example, "Hamilton" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda collaborated with Alan Menken on new tunes for this year's "Little Mermaid," plus wrote songs for "Moana" and "Encanto." (In this case, it's definitely all right to talk about "Bruno.")
Looking through Disney history, there are a few that top our charts – like "Feed the Birds" from "Mary Poppins," a fave of Walt's back in the day, and the title love song of "Beauty and the Beast." And if you don't dig them, well ... let it go.

Since Woody, Buzz and the crew first stole our hearts in 1995's "Toy Story," Disney's Pixar has launched a slew of great animated movies. To date, the studio has won 23 Academy Awards – including 11 for best animated feature – and two films, "Toy Story 3" and "Up," were nominated for best picture.
While the "Cars" movies have never exactly been our speed, "Monsters Inc.," "Coco" and "The Incredibles" rank high on our all-time Pixar list. And the studio is rolling into the next 100 years without a hiccup: "Elemental" (now streaming on Disney+) was a word-of-mouth summer hit – and Pixar's first rom-com – and next year brings the out-of-this world original "Elio" (in theaters March 1) and the sequel "Inside Out 2" (June 14).
'Elemental':The definitive ranking of all 27 Pixar movies
No one puts comic-book icons on screen like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The MCU started with 2008's "Iron Man," yet it really soared when Disney took over with 2012's "Avengers" film. Dozens of movies later, the MCU has delivered cinematic phenomenons and worldwide hits like "Avengers: Endgame," "Black Panther" and "Spider-Man: No Way Home."
For us, "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" and "Guardians of the Galaxy" are top-tier MCU choices in a universe that continues to grow. The upcoming pipeline includes new films such as "The Marvels," starring Brie Larson, "WandaVision" standout Teyonah Parris and "Ms. Marvel" actress Iman Vellani.
Ranked:Every Marvel superhero movie (including 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3')
"Star Wars" has been a pop-culture powerhouse for more than 40 years but the franchise is one of the newer additions to the Disney portfolio: The company purchased Lucasfilm (also the home of the "Indiana Jones" movies) from George Lucas in 2012.
The Force has been strong with Disney, with a new "Star Wars" sequel trilogy – 2015's "The Force Awakens" is the all-time domestic box-office champ with a $936.7 million haul – and an expansion into streaming with Disney+ series including "The Mandalorian" and "Ahsoka." But the best stuff is still Lucas' old-school "The Empire Strikes Back" and original 1977 "Star Wars," proving alongside other Disney classics of the past 100 years that vintage is often a good thing.

Every bit of integrity the International Olympic Committee had is going to be in shreds by the time Thomas Bach walks out the door.
The IOC’s despot has already debased the Games he so claims to love with his devotion to Vladimir Putin and refusal to do anything while Russia blatantly undercuts the principles of the Olympic movement time and again. Now he’s laying the groundwork to be king for life, like the autocrats he’s cozied up to throughout most of his reign.
Under the current Olympic charter, which Bach himself helped write, the IOC president can serve a maximum of 12 years. Bach was first elected, to an eight-year term, in September 2013, then re-elected for four more years in 2021.
Which means his tenure as president should end in September 2025, following the election of a new president.
But lo and behold, some “concerned” IOC members raised the idea Sunday of Bach staying beyond the term limits. It would require the Olympic charter to be rewritten and for a key anti-corruption measure enacted after the Salt Lake City bid scandal to be removed. But what’s a little banana republic governance when it’s to Bach’s benefit!
“A number of these colleagues think and feel an election campaign, so early before the election, would be disrupting the preparations for the Olympic Games in Paris, which are so important for the entire Olympic movement. They would like to avoid this,” Bach said Monday morning.
This reasoning, if you can call it that, is nonsensical. Given the Olympics are held every two years, an election is always going to overlap with the preparations for a Games. If IOC members are worried about disrupting the leadup to Paris, what’s to keep them from saying the same ahead of Milan in 2026? Or Los Angeles in 2028? Or Brisbane in 2032? Or … you get the picture.
And if the preparations for Paris are so fraught the IOC can’t possibly spare the mental bandwidth for an election, whose fault is that? Last I checked, Bach was the IOC president when Paris was awarded the 2024 Olympics and has been president throughout the entire leadup. If the city isn’t ready, that’s on Bach, and is further reason to move on from him, not keep him around even longer.
There also hasn’t been a parade of IOC members declaring their wish to be the Olympic governing body’s next president. The only one who’s come close is Sebastian Coe — which probably explains Bach’s willingness to trample on Olympic norms once again.
Coe, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in track and field, became president of World Athletics after running the organizing committee for the wildly successful London Games in 2012. And unlike Bach, he’s been steadfast in holding Russia accountable for its many transgressions against the Olympic movement.
Russia had only one track and field athlete at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics because Coe refused to lift a ban imposed as punishment for the country’s sophisticated, state-sponsored doping program. He was similarly tough in Tokyo, when fewer than a dozen Russian athletes were cleared to compete.
And while other international federations have gradually caved to Bach’s wish that “individual neutral athletes” from Russia and Belarus be allowed to return to competition despite the ongoing atrocities in Ukraine, Coe has refused.
“The death and destruction we have seen in Ukraine over the past year, including the deaths of some 185 athletes, have only hardened my resolve on this matter,” Coe said in March.
The only resolve Bach has shown is to sell out the Olympics at every turn.
Imagining and implementing a sophisticated doping program to rig the medal count, as Russia did, goes against everything the Olympics represent. So, too, its blatant defiance of sanctions that were already laughably light. But not for Bach! There’s no sin by Putin and Russia he can’t forgive.
China has a well-documented history of abusing human rights, and its treatment of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang has been characterized as genocide. The Winter Olympics in Beijing made a mockery of the IOC’s supposed priority of sustainability. To Bach, however, President Xi Jinping and China were ideal partners!
Being the IOC president is a political job, yes. But it’s also a sacred trust. The Olympics are supposed to represent the best of humanity and remind us what we’re capable of when we strive for greatness and refuse to accept the limitations put on us. The IOC, and its president in particular, have no greater responsibility than to foster and protect that environment.
Maybe Bach believed in that mission once, but his actions since taking office have repeatedly betrayed both the ideals behind the Olympics and the people whose sweat and sacrifice make them so awe-inspiring. He’s done enough damage, and doesn’t deserve the chance to do more.

The cost of a gallon of gas keeps falling despite a tumultuous period for oil prices after Hamas launched an attack on Israel earlier this month.
The national average for regular unleaded fell about 3 cents to $3.60 -- from $3.628 on Friday, -- according to AAA, a nonprofit federation of motor clubs that tracks fuel costs. The decline comes as oil hovers around $90 per barrel. The price of crude, which is refined into gasoline, makes up more than half the price of a gallon of fuel.
Oil prices rose after Hamas' surprise attack on Israel 10 days ago, but the spike was far less than the roughly $40 per barrel temporary surge following last year’s invasion of Ukraine by Russia, AAA says. The critical difference is that Russia is a significant oil producer, while Israel and the Palestinian territories are not, it said.
“As long as this war does not spread to include more countries in the region, the effect on the oil market will remain muted,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a statement.
At a statewide average of $5.621 a gallon, Californians may not feel much relief at the pump. But prices are lower, down more than 18 cents from a week earlier, from $5.804, AAA says.
Pump prices are dropping in the Golden State, as they are in the rest of the country, because of lower demand from drivers and less expensive blends of winter gasoline coming into the market. California introduced its winter blend earlier than usual this year, and it contains a larger amount of a cheaper ingredient that helps cars start at lower temperatures. Typically, California doesn't make the switch until the end of October. Winter blend gas can shave 15 to 20 cents off a gallon of gas, said Doug Shupe, AAA spokesperson in California.
California gas is generally more expensive than the rest of the nation due to:

If violence does not spread further in the Middle East and there are no other geopolitical shocks, "I believe the national average still has some 15 to 35 cents of declining to do,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.
He said he remains "cautious, that this depends on actions that are not foreseeable, mainly the conflict in the Middle East. For now, the national average is likely to soon fall to its lowest level in six months."
More than 20% of global liquid petroleum in 2018 moved through the Strait of Hormuz, which is located between Oman and Iran, and connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

WASHINGTON − While grappling with gun charges and a tax investigation, Hunter Biden faces potentially a third set of charges: His decision not to register as a "foreign agent" while working with companies in Ukraine and China.
The inquiry comes as the Justice Department recalibrates its enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, for people to report their work for foreign governments trying to influence U.S. policy. An inspector general’s report in 2016 found prosecutions and other enforcement actions were “rare" and consisted mostly of civil requests to register retroactively.
But after Russian interference in the 2016 election, the department ramped up criminal enforcement with maximum penalties for violations of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., was indicted Thursday for an alleged conspiracy to violate the act as a foreign agent for Egypt.
The results of criminal prosecutions have been mixed. Several high-profile associates of Donald Trump were convicted – and he pardoned them. Other defendants accused of being foreign agents had charges dismissed or won acquittals.
In this highly politicized atmosphere, Justice Department special counsel David Weiss is investigating whether Hunter Biden should have registered his overseas work. Congressional Republicans argue Biden is getting preferential treatment as the president’s son. And one of Hunter Biden’s lawyers, Abbe Lowell, won the acquittal of another defendant charged with acting as a foreign agent.
Congress adopted the Foreign Agents Registration Act in 1938 – and updated it many times – to reduce the influence of foreign propaganda. "Foreign agents," who are defined as operating under the direction or control of a foreign government that seeks to influence U.S. policy, must register with the Justice Department to disclose their efforts. A related statute prohibits acting as a foreign agent.
The problem with the act, according to legal experts, is determining when somebody is just advocating for another country and when the person is acting under the foreign government's "direction or control," as the statute states.
“Part of the problem is that the law is very vague. Nobody knows what it means to be an agent,” said Michael Schachter, a former federal prosecutor and now a partner at Willkie Farr and Gallagher, who won an acquittal for a defendant charged with being a foreign agent. “It’s a very vague statute and it’s capable of being misused by the Justice Department.”
For example, Schachter opened a trial noting that McDonald's closed 850 restaurants in Russia days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Congress that U.S. businesses "must leave" that country. McDonald's did the right thing, but not under Ukraine's direction, Schachter said.
Likewise, people might advocate for Israel in its war against Hamas but don't need to register with the government, according to William Taylor, another lawyer who won the acquittal of a defendant in a case related to the act.
“A lot of people do things for the benefit of a foreign country,” said Taylor, a founding partner at Zuckerman Spaeder who won the acquittal of a defendant in a case related to the act. “It’s not always easy to distinguish between what somebody does because he’s in favor of a particular policy or wants to do something to benefit a country he likes – and somebody who’s got an agreement with the country to advocate on its behalf for money.”
Exemptions to registering were made for diplomacy, news gathering and commerce. The statute says “any person engaged in legal commercial transaction” is exempt, but should register if operating in the U.S. “subject to the direction or control of a foreign government or official.” The statute also has a five-year limit on prosecutions.
"It has to be lobbying or public relations," said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers. "If it's just commercial activity, that's exempt."
Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma Holdings Ltd., an oil and gas company in Ukraine, from May 2014 and left in April 2019, from the time his father served as vice president until he began running for president. The arrangement raised concerns about potential conflicts because the Obama administration was trying to influence Ukraine's policy.
Congressional Republicans have also alleged Hunter Biden and his associates received millions of dollars from Chinese entities such as State Energy HK Ltd. and CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd. GOP lawmakers called CEFC "an extension of the Chinese government."
A document filed with Hunter Biden's rejected plea agreement said in 2017 he earned "just under $1 million" from a company he formed with a Chinese CEO, $664,000 from a Chinese infrastructure company and $500,000 in director's fees from Burisma.
“We will continue to follow the Bidens’ money trail to determine whether foreign actors targeted the Bidens, President Biden is compromised, and our national security is threatened,” said Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., head of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee.
But Devon Archer, a business associate at Burisma, told the committee “there was no business conversation” when Hunter Biden put his father on the speaker phone about 20 times during a 10-year partnership.
"It was, you know, just general niceties and, you know, conversation in general about the geography, about the weather, whatever it may be,” Archer said.
The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, said at an impeachment inquiry hearing Republicans had no evidence linking Hunter Biden’s business deals to President Joe Biden.
"Back in the reality-based world, the majority sits completely empty-handed with no evidence of any presidential wrongdoing, no smoking gun, no gun, no smoke,” Raskin added.
The department’s Justice Manual, which offers written guidance about how to pursue cases, directs inquiries about the act to the registration unit. In past decades, if authorities notice a potential violation, the department traditionally sent a letter asking the person to register retroactively, according to congressional testimony and legal experts.
No prosecution is to begin without the authorization of the National Security Division, the manual says.
Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department’s inspector general, reported in September 2016 that prosecutions and other enforcement under the act were “rare.”
From 1966 to 2015, the department prosecuted seven FARA cases that resulted in five convictions, but only three on FARA charges, Horowitz found. FBI agents expressed frustration with a perceived reluctance to pursue, although the National Security Division denied the criticism.
Revelations about foreign attempts to influence U.S. policy shined a spotlight on FARA enforcement and criminal prosecutions ramped up.
Investigations by special counsel Robert Mueller and agencies in the intelligence community found Russia interfered in the 2016 election by hacking Democratic Party emails and spreading favorable information about Republican nominee Trump while discrediting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Mueller's team and other prosecutors won several convictions under the act.
Criminal prosecutions under the act targeted several of Trump's allies:
◾ Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman in 2016, pleaded guilty in 2018 to a conspiracy charge based, in part, on failing to register as a foreign agent for Ukraine and former President Viktor Yanukovych. Manafort was also convicted at trial of defrauding banks and taxpayers. Trump pardoned Manafort.
◾ Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about meetings with Russians during the transition from the Obama administration. In a statement accompanying the plea, Flynn admitted making false statements related to FARA for work benefiting Turkey. Flynn registered retroactively as a foreign agent in February 2017 and disclosed he received $530,000 from a Dutch firm with ties to Turkey’s government. Trump pardoned Flynn.
◾ Elliott Broidy, a fundraiser for Trump and the Republican Party, pleaded guilty in 2020 to conspiracy to violate FARA by lobbying senior government officials for Chinese and Malaysian interests. He acknowledged lobbying to deport a Chinese dissident, Guo Wengui, and to drop the fraud and money-laundering prosecution of 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Trump pardoned Broidy.
◾ Bijan Rafiekian, who was director and vice chairman of Flynn Intel Group, was charged in 2018 with failing to register as an agent for Turkey aiming to win the extradition of a cleric living in the U.S. But the Justice Department dropped the charges in September, after two trips to the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
◾ Tom Barrack, who was chair of Trump’s 2017 inauguration, was acquitted in November 2022 of charges he was a foreign agent who used his access to Trump to promote the interests of the United Arab Emirates. Others who called UAE an "important ally" included Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, Schachter said at trial.
◾ Greg Craig, a former White House counsel in the Obama administration, was acquitted of FARA-related charges in September 2019. He was charged with making false statements to federal investigators about whether he was required to register under FARA for his work on a report about a Ukrainian opposition figure. But Craig testified in his own defense saying he didn’t view himself as doing the bidding of Ukraine.
“The case was about Greg’s trying to correct the statements about a report he’d written,” said Taylor, his lawyer. "But he wasn’t doing it for the benefit of the government of Ukraine, he was doing it to protect his own reputation.”
Schachter, who was Barrack's lawyer, said the defendant was jailed for four days under charges a jury ultimately rejected.
“Of course, they overstepped,” Schachter said of prosecutors. “They charged an innocent man with a crime and took away his liberty.”
An assistant to Barrack, Matthew Grimes, was also acquitted of charges he was a foreign agent. Grimes was represented by Lowell, a lawyer now representing Hunter Biden. Lowell told CNN after Grimes' acquittal the case represented "overreaching and overcharging."
"The system needs more supervision to prevent these kinds of cases from being filed," Lowell said.
Lowell declined to comment on the Grimes case or the Hunter Biden investigation.
The long-running federal investigation of Hunter Biden has touched on FARA issues, as revealed by House Republicans and during the court hearing over his abandoned plea deal. But he has not been charged with any violations.
House Republicans released an email Lesley Wolf, an assistant U.S. attorney in Delaware, wrote on Aug. 7, 2020, about a draft search warrant.
“Please focus on FARA evidence only,” Wolf wrote.
In July, Hunter Biden was expected to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for not paying taxes in 2017 and 2018, and entering a pretrial program for a gun violation.
But U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected the agreement because of disputes between prosecutors and defense lawyers. One dispute was over whether the agreement protected Hunter Biden from future prosecution under FARA.
“Could the government bring a charge under the Foreign Agents Registration Act?” Noreika asked at the hearing on July 26, noting that the “facts section” of the deal referred to foreign companies.
“Yes,” replied Leo Wise, one of the prosecutors.
But Christopher Clark, one of Hunter Biden’s lawyers, disagreed.
“As stated by the government just now, I don’t agree with what the government said,” Clark said.
Republican lawmakers have questioned the lack of FARA charges against Hunter Biden for years:
◾ Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., released a report in September 2020 saying that “CEFC was an extension of the Chinese government and that CEFC intended to alter U.S. policy and public opinion to its benefit and that the Chinese government would be the principal beneficiary of those actions.”
◾ Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., who heads the Ways and Means Committee, released more documents on Sept. 27 about Hunter Biden’s business deals. “Even more alarming, the Biden family foreign influence peddling operation suggests an effort to sway U.S. policy decisions,” Smith said.
◾ Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., who heads the Oversight and Accountability Committee, commended Noreika for “refusing to rubberstamp” the plea deal. “Today, the Department of Justice revealed Hunter Biden is under investigation for being a foreign agent,” Comer said July 26.
The charges against Trump’s inner circle – combined with the lack of charges against Hunter Biden – is why some Republicans contend there is a two-tier system of justice.
“What infuriates people is the uneven application of the law,” said Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill., a former federal prosecutor.
Without mentioning foreign registration specifically, Attorney General Merrick Garland has said the investigation of Hunter Biden will be handled fairly. Weiss will produce a report about what charges he chose to pursue or decline as special counsel.
"The Justice Department treats everyone alike regardless of party, regardless of ethnicity, regardless of wealth," Garland told the House Judiciary Committee on Sept. 20. "I understand that people may not understand why particular investigations are conducted in particular ways until all the facts come out. That's what we have a court for."
House Republicans have tried for years to tie Hunter Biden's overseas business deals to the president, but witnesses at a Sept. 28 House Oversight hearing said there was not enough evidence for charges yet.
“They're merely allegations and they should not become presumptions of impeachable conduct,” said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.
Bruce Dubinsky, a forensic accountant, said he wouldn’t prejudge the information.
“I am not here today to even suggest that there was corruption, fraud, or any wrongdoing,” Dubinsky said.
White House spokesperson Sharon Yang called the hearing a "baseless stunt" by Republicans and a waste of time for "peddling debunked lies."
"This flop was a failed effort to distract from their own chaos and inability to govern that is careening the country towards an unnecessary government shutdown that will hurt American families," Yang said.
A few days later, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., said in arguing to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., “it is difficult to champion oversight when House Republicans haven’t even sent a subpoena to Hunter Biden.”
“It is hard to make the argument that oversight is the reason to continue when it sort of looks like failure theater,” Gaetz said.
When Angel Amankwaah traveled from Denver to North Carolina Central University for incoming student orientation this summer, she decided she had made the right choice. 
She had fun learning the chants that fans perform at football games. But she also saw that “there are students who look like me, and professors who look like me” at the historically Black university, said Amankwaah, 18, who is Black. “I knew that I was in a safe space.”
This has in the last two years become an important consideration for college-bound students from all backgrounds and beliefs. With so much attention focused on these issues, USA TODAY and The Hechinger Report present the first-of-its-kind College Welcome Guide showing state laws and institutional policies that affect college and university students, from bans on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and “critical race theory” to rules about guns on campus and whether student IDs are accepted as proof of residency for voting purposes.
The digital tables also list, for every four-year institution in the country, such things as racial and gender diversity among students and faculty, the number of student veterans enrolled, the incidence of on-campus race-motivated hate crimes, free-speech rankings and if the university or college serves many students from rural places.
College Welcome Guide: Test it yourself.These tools new offer a new on campus life
Students have long picked schools based on their academic reputations and social life. But with campuses in the crosshairs of the culture wars, many students are now also taking stock of attacks on diversity, course content and speech and speakers from both ends of the political spectrum. They’re monitoring hate crimes, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, state abortion laws and whether students like them ‒ Black, rural, military veterans, LGBTQ+ or from other backgrounds ‒ are represented and supported on campus.
“There’s no question that what’s happening at the state level is directly affecting these students,” said Alyse Levine, founder and CEO of Premium Prep, a private college admissions consulting firm in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. When they look at colleges in various states now, she said, “There are students who are asking, ‘Am I really wanted here?’”
For some students on both sides of the political divide, the answer is no. In the chaotic new world of American colleges and universities, many say they feel unwelcome at certain schools, while others are prepared to shut down speakers and report faculty with whose opinions they disagree.
It’s too early to know how much this trend will affect where and whether prospective students end up going to college since publicly available enrollment data lags real time. But there are early clues that it’s having a significant impact.
One in 4 prospective students has already ruled out a college or university for consideration because of the political climate in its state, according to a survey by the higher education consulting firm Art & Science Group.
Among students who describe themselves as liberal, the most common reason to rule out colleges and universities in a particular state, that survey found, is because it’s “too Republican” or has what they consider lax gun regulations, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, restrictive abortion laws and a lack of concern about racism. Students who describe themselves as conservative are rejecting states they believe to be “too Democrat” and that have liberal abortion and gay rights laws.
Sixty percent of prospective students of all backgrounds say new state restrictions on abortion would at least somewhat influence where they choose to go to college, a separate poll by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation found. Of these, 8 in 10 say they would prefer to go to a state with greater access to reproductive health services. (Lumina is among the funders of The Hechinger Report, which produced this story.)
“We have many young women who will not look at certain states,” said Levine. One of her own clients backed out of going to a university in St. Louis after Missouri banned almost all abortions following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, she said.
Institutions in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Texas are the most likely to be knocked off the lists of liberal students, according to the Art & Science Group survey. They’re generally most likely to steer clear of the South and Midwest, while conservative students avoid California and New York.
One in 8 high school students in Florida say they won’t go to a public university in their own state because of its education policies, a separate poll, by the college ranking and information website Intelligent.com, found.
With 494 anti-LGBTQ+ laws proposed or adopted this year, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, prospective students who are LGBTQ+ and have experienced significant harassment because of it are nearly twice as likely to say they don't plan to go to college at all compared with students who experienced lower levels of harassment, according to a survey by GLSEN, formerly the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.
“You are attacking kids who are already vulnerable,” said Javier Gomez, an LGBTQ+ student in his first year at Miami Dade College. “And it’s not just queer students. So many young people are fed up.”
It’s not yet evident whether the new laws are affecting where LGBTQ+ young people are choosing to go to college, said Casey Pick, director of law and policy at The Trevor Project, which supports LGBTQ+ young people in crisis. But LGBTQ+ adults are moving away from states passing anti-LGBTQ+ laws, she said. And “if adult employees are taking this into account when they decide where they want to live, you can bet that college students are making the same decisions.”
Since DeSantis takeover,surge in dropouts at New College of Florida
Meanwhile, in an era of pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion policies in many states, and against affirmative action in college admissions nationwide, Amankwaah is one of a growing number of Black students choosing what they see as the relative security of an HBCU. Enrollment at HBCUs increased by around 3% in 2021, the last year for which the figure is available, while the number of students at other universities and colleges fell. 
“The real attack here is on the feeling of belonging,” said Jeremy Young, who directs the Freedom to Learn program at PEN America, which tracks laws that restrict college and university diversity efforts and teaching about race. “What it really does is hoist a flag to say to the most marginalized students, ‘We don’t want you here.’” 
More than 40% of university and college administrators say the Supreme Court ruling curbing the use of affirmative action in admissions will affect diversity on their campuses, a Princeton Review poll found as the school year was beginning.
College students of all races and political persuasions report feeling uncomfortable on campuses that have become political battlegrounds. Those on the left are bristling at new laws blocking programs in diversity, equity and inclusion and the teaching of certain perspectives about race; on the right, at conservative speakers being shouted down or canceled, unpopular comments being called out in class and what they see as an embrace of values different from what they learned at home.
More than 1 in 10 students at four-year universities now say they feel as if they downright don’t belong on their campus, and another 2 in 10 neither agree nor strongly agree that they belong, another Lumina and Gallup survey found. It found that those who answer in these ways are more likely to frequently experience stress and more likely to drop out.
Military veterans who use their GI Bill benefits to return to school say one of their most significant barriers is a feeling that they won’t be welcome, a survey by the D’Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University found. Nearly two-thirds say that faculty and administrators don’t understand the challenges they face, and 70% say the same thing about their non-veteran classmates. 
Colleges should be “safe and affirming spaces,” said Pick, of the Trevor Project ‒ not places of isolation and alienation.
Yet a significant number of students say they don’t feel comfortable sharing their views in class, according to another survey, conducted by College Pulse for the right-leaning Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at North Dakota State University. Of those, 72% say they worry their opinions would be considered unacceptable by classmates and 45%, by their professors. Conservative students are less likely than their liberal classmates to believe that all points of view are welcome and less willing to share theirs. 
“Is that really an intellectually diverse environment?” asked Sean Stevens, director of polling and analytics at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, which has launched a campus free-speech ranking based on students’ perceptions of comfort expressing ideas, tolerance for speakers and other measures. 
“Anecdotally and from personal experience, there’s certainly a pocket of students who are weighing these factors in terms of where to go to college,” Stevens said.
Eighty-one percent of liberal students and 53% of conservative ones say they support reporting faculty who make comments that they find offensive, the same survey found. It used sample comments such as, “There is no evidence of anti-Black bias in police shootings,” “Requiring vaccination for COVID is an assault on individual freedom” and “Biological sex is a scientific fact.”
A professor at Texas A&M University became the subject of an investigation when a student accused her of criticizing the state’s lieutenant governor during a lecture, though she was ultimately exonerated. An anthropology lecturer at the University of Chicago who taught an undergraduate course called “The Problem of Whiteness” said she was deluged with hateful messages when a conservative student posted her photo and email address on social media.
More than half of all freshmen say that colleges have the right to ban extreme speakers, according to an annual survey by an institute at the University of California, Los Angeles; the College Pulse poll says that sentiment is held by twice the proportion of liberal students as conservative ones.
A group of Stanford students in March disrupted an on-campus speech by a federal judge whose judicial record they said was anti-LGBTQ+. When he asked for an administrator to intervene, an associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion confronted him and asked: “Is it worth the pain that this causes and the division that this causes?” The associate dean was put on leave and later resigned. 
“Today it is a sad fact that the greatest threat to free speech comes from within the academy,” pronounced the right-leaning American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which is pushing colleges to sign on to its Campus Freedom Initiative that encourages teaching students about free expression during freshman orientation and disciplining people who disrupt speakers or events, among other measures.
“I have to imagine that universities that have a bad track record on freedom of expression or academic freedom, that it will affect their reputations,” said Steven Maguire, the organization’s campus freedom fellow. “I do hear people saying things like, ‘I’m worried about what kind of a college or university I can send my kids to and whether they’ll be free to be themselves and to express themselves.’”
Some colleges are now actively recruiting students on the basis of these kinds of concerns. Colorado College in September created a program to ease the process for students who want to transfer away from institutions in states that have banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; Hampshire College in Massachusetts has offered admission to any student from New College in Florida, subject of what critics have described as a conservative takeover. Thirty-five have so far accepted the invitation.
Though many conservative critics of colleges and universities say faculty are indoctrinating students with liberal opinions, incoming freshmen tend to hold left-leaning views before they ever set foot in a classroom, according to that UCLA survey.
Fewer than 1 in 5 consider themselves conservative. Three-quarters say abortion should be legal and favor stricter gun control laws, 68% say wealthy people should pay more taxes than they do now and 86% that climate change should be a federal priority and that there should be a clear path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
Prospective students say they are watching as new laws are passed and controversies erupt on campuses and actively looking into not just the quality of food and available majors at the colleges they might attend, but state politics.
“Once I decided I was going to North Carolina Central, I looked up whether North Carolina was a red state or a blue state,” Amankwaah said. (North Carolina has a Democrat as governor but Republicans control both chambers of the legislature and hold a veto-proof supermajority in the state Senate. 
Florida’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws prompted Javier Gomez to leave his native state and move to New York to go to fashion school. But then he came back, transferring to Miami Dade.
“People ask me, ‘Why the hell are you back in Florida?’” said Gomez. “The reason I came back was that there was this innate calling in me that you have to stick around and fight for the queer and trans kids here. It’s overwhelming at times. It can be very mentally depleting. But I wanted to stay and continue the fight and build community against hatred.”

WASHINGTON − Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the Justice Department has opened a federal hate crimes investigation into what led to the stabbing death of Wadea Al Fayoume and the serious injuries to his mother, Hanaan Shahin, in Illinois.
Garland warned that the incident would raise fears among Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities about hate-fueled violence. But he said the department would “use every legal authority at our disposal to bring justice to those who perpetrate illegal acts of hate.”
“I am heartbroken by the abhorrent killing of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a six year old child who died after being stabbed 26 times with a military-style knife,” Garland said in a statement late Sunday. “On behalf of the entire Justice Department, I want to express my deepest condolences to his family and his community as they grieve his loss.”
“No one in the United States of America should have to live in fear of violence because of how they worship or where they or their family come from.”
Joseph Czuba, 71, of Plainfield Township, about 40 miles southwest of Chicago, was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and two counts of hate crime for what authorities believe was a targeted attack in response to the Israel-Hamas war, according to the Will County Sheriff's office.
Law enforcement agencies reported 11,643 incidents of hate crimes in 2022 motivated by bias against race, religion or sexual orientation, the FBI announced in an annual report released Monday. The total represented a nearly 7% increase from the 10,891 incidents of hate crimes reported in 2021, as more law enforcement agencies participated in reporting, the FBI said. Incidents of crimes motivated by religion rose to 2,044 last year from 1,613 the previous year, the FBI said.
President Joe Biden issued a statement urging Americans to “reject Islamophobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred.”
“The child’s Palestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we all seek − a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace,” Biden said. “This horrific act of hate has no place in America, and stands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are.”  
Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter, said the "killing in the name of bigotry is nothing short of evil."
"Wadea should be heading to school in the morning. Instead, his parents will wake up without their son," Pritzker said. "This wasn't just a murder – it was a hate crime."
Deputies responded to the home of Shahin and Wadea on Saturday morning after they received a call reporting a stabbing involving a landlord and a tenant. At the scene, deputies found Czuba sitting on the ground near the driveway. Inside a bedroom, investigators discovered Shahin and Wadea suffering from more than a dozen severe stab wounds.
They were rushed to a local hospital in critical condition. Wadea died from his injuries on Sunday. His mother was expected to recover, according to law enforcement.
Though Czuba did not answer investigator's questions, detectives determined he stabbed the woman and her child "due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis," the sheriff's office said.
At a news conference Sunday, the Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-Chicago) said the boy and his mother lived on the ground floor of the residence for two years, and Czuba was their landlord. The family had "no previous notable issues" with Czuba, the Muslim civil rights and advocacy group said.
Multiple text messages reportedly sent to the father and shared with CAIR-Chicago showed Czuba was "angry with what he was seeing in the news" before he attacked the family. The texts said Czuba yelled 'You Muslims must die!'" while he was attacking Shahin and her son.
"Our hearts are heavy, and our prayers are with the darling boy and his mother,” said Ahmed Rehab, CAIR-Chicago executive director. “We have full confidence in the authorities to investigate this heinous incident as a hate crime and to do so swiftly.” 
As is always the case, preseason polls are speculative ventures at best. With the exception of San Diego State, last year’s eventual Final Four were nowhere to be found in the initial Top 25, and the preseason No. 1 team missed the Big Dance altogether.
It is inevitable that somebody not rated at the start of the year will have a breakthrough season. Who might that be? Did we mention this whole thing is speculative?
In the era of the transfer portal, true dark horses are hard to identify. It’s furthermore not totally accurate to consider a major conference program a dark horse. But with all that in mind, we’ll attempt to pick a few teams not in the Top 25 that seem well positioned for a successful season.
The Fighting Illini have made the last three tournaments but left disappointed after not making the Sweet 16. This group has the potential to reach that goal and possibly compete for the Big Ten title. Terrence Shannon (17.2 pgg) and Coleman Hawkins (9.9 pgg) both flirted with the NBA draft before returning. Dain Dainja (9.5 ppg) brings size to the frontcourt. The big question is the backcourt. A lot is on the shoulder of point guard Sencire Harris. If he develops as sophomore, and transfers Marcus Domask  (Southern Illinois) and Quincy Guerrier (Oregon) integrate well, this could be a dangerous team in March.
Jerome Tang has already proven to be a masterful roster constructor in just one year in the Little Apple with the Wildcats making a memorable run to the Elite Eight that ended in a narrow loss to Florida Atlantic. There's some rebuilding to do, and his mettle will be tested again as he relies on incoming talent to fill a lot of needs. Enter Tylor Perry, a standout at North Texas, to run the point and Arthur Kaluma, a key role player at Creighton, to step into the frontcourt. The return of power forward Nae'Qwan Tomlin (10.4 ppg) will also help.
ROCK CHALK: Kansas leads preseason poll for the fifth time
OUTLOOKS:In-depth previews for every team in the preseason Top 25
It’s somewhat curious that highly regarded Purdue and Michigan State are the Big Ten’s lone representatives in the initial poll. This is mainly due to how tightly bunched the middle of the pack wound up last year, but it stands to reason that at least a couple more league members will spend some time in the Top 25. The Terrapins could be one of those teams, returning a trio of double-digit scorers. Jahmir Young (15.8 ppg), Julian Reese (11.4 ppg) and Donta Scott (11.3 ppg) will also be joined by a strong recruiting class in Kevin Willard’s second year at the helm.
Jaime Dixon slowly has built the Horned Frogs into a tournament regular with the team advancing to the second round the past two seasons. The big challenge for this year's team will be replacing do-everything star Mike Miles, who led the team in scoring, and also departed senior Damion Baugh. Emmanuel Miller (12.3 ppg, 6.5 rpg) has the ability to step in and fill the shoes of Miles. Help should be provided by a veteran group of returners, led by JaKobe Coles, Chuck O'Bannon and Micah Peavy. That experience should be instrumental in helping weather a difficult Big 12 schedule and get TCU back into the tournament with a chance to make a run.
As San Diego State showed last year, the Mountain West is a league worthy of respect. Former Gonzaga assistant Leon Rice has slowly built a consistent winner in Boise. This could be the year that translates into a longer stay in March Madness. The high-scoring and experienced Broncos trio of Tyson Degenhart (14.1 ppg), Max Rice (14.0 ppg) and Chibuzo Agbo (11.5 ppg) will be joined by former Division II standout Cam Martin, who was a medical redshirt at Kansas last year, to bolster the frontcourt.
Amazon driver Eligha Bryant delivered more than a package at one Chicago home recently. He dropped some fashion pointers.
Bryant, 42, is an Amazon Delivery Service Partner driver and was making a stop at the house on Oct. 7 when he saw the family that lives there gathered around their teenage son, Luke Breier. The teen was struggling to secure his tie, so Bryant stepped in to help.
Family members stood around smiling and laughing as he hyped the teenager up and made sure his tie was tidy and in place.
“You’re killing the game, young man,” Bryant said to the high school senior in a video shared online.
“He was clean. He reminded me of myself when I was coming up. That’s how I used to dress," said Bryant, who works for one of Amazon's third-party Delivery Service Partners, or companies that contract drivers to deliver packages. 
Bryant, a father of three sons and five girls, said he was passing along knowledge he had learned as a youngster himself. An avid churchgoer since his youth, he often dressed up in nice suits and attended with his mother, father and godparents.
So Bryant learned to tie a tie at the early age of 10. “All the brothers around me showed me how to,” he said.When he saw Breier struggling with his tie, Bryant felt like he should pay it forward.
Bryant’s story made it to the local news Monday and was covered by FOX 32 Chicago. His older sister called him to tell him about it.
“I didn't believe it at first but then I had other people calling me,” he said. “It made me feel good.”

Nicole Breier, the teenager’s mother, said Bryant did a great thing at a time where kind acts are needed.
“We live here in Chicago where racial tension is so high, especially in our neighborhood, which is known to be super racist,” she said. “It was just great to see two people reacting to each other regardless of color and that's the part that just really makes me happy.”
Her son, Luke Breier, said Bryant’s handiwork with his tie took his look to the next level. Bryant’s an awesome person for what he did, he said.
“It shows a lot about him,” Luke said. “It shows that he will go out his way to do something for someone else.”
Bryant said he was taught to love everybody and sees everyone as equal.
In addition to the suit the teen wore for homecoming, Luke also put on a flashy watch and Burberry cologne, which Bryant loved.
When he saw the teen in his homecoming gear, Bryant had nothing but good things to say.
“You got it,” he said. “You’re all the way clean. You’re all the way fresh.”

The late Suzanne Somers, who played the bubbly blonde Chrissy Snow on the TV sitcom "Three's Company," was loved by many. Tributes kept pouring in on social media following her death on Sunday.
The actress, best-selling author and entrepreneur died early morning Sunday surrounded by her family, Somers' longtime publicist, R. Couri Hay, said in a statement announcing her death. She was 76.
Somers' "Three's Company" co-star Joyce DeWitt, who played Janet Wood opposite Somers' Chrissy, said her "heart goes out to Suzanne’s family" in the wake of the actress' death.
"I'm sure Suzanne was greeted by angels into the loving wisdom waiting for all of us on the other side," DeWitt said in a statement to People magazine on Monday. "I hope that will assist her family's hearts in healing as they travel through this difficult time."
News of Somers' death came one day before her 77th birthday on Oct. 16th. Her family was set to gather and celebrate her birthday and now will continue to honor her legacy. "They will celebrate her extraordinary life, and want to thank her millions of fans and followers who loved her dearly," her publicist said.
Processing loss:Suzanne Somers' death has devastated fans. It's OK to grieve.
Singer-songwriter Barry Manilow paid tribute to his longtime friend Somers in a statement to People magazine on Sunday.
"Suzanne and I were friends for decades. She was the sister I never had and my close confidant forever," the 80-year-old told the outlet. "We shared triumphs and heartaches. Her fame in so many fields overshadowed her real talent as one of our greatest comedic actors, a loving mother, an amazing homemaker, and one of the world’s best cooks. I will miss her dearly and hope that she is now out of pain and at peace."
The two were friends for more than 40 years and were neighbors in the Palm Springs area. Of her relationship with Manilow, Somers once told People magazine that she "instantly felt comfortable with him and could let my guard down and just be."
"Sad so sad," Goldie Hawn commented on an Instagram post.
Actress Morgan Fairchild remembered her friend Somers fondly. "She was a friend & supportive when I was diagnosed with black mold," she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. "When we ran into each other, she would lean over & whisper, 'We're survivors!'"

Caitlyn Jenner shared on Instagram that "we lost a true American Icon today" alongside a photo of the two from the 70s in Southern California.
"You will be missed," Jenner wrote. "It was always a pleasure and a riot working with you over the years!"
Viola Davis shared that she grew up watching Somers on "Three's Company." "You were a joy and forever young," Davis wrote. "Rest well."
On her Instagram Stories, Khloe Kardashian wrote that hearing of Somers' death "hurts my heart." She continued: "I'll never forget your positive looking outlook on life. Your sweet heart and gentle spirit! Rest, dance, smile in paradise..."
TV personality Bethenny Frankel shared a video reaction to her Instagram Story and said, "Suzanne Somers has passed away, which is such tragic news. I had the pleasure of getting to know her. She is a force, she is groundbreaking, she is love."
She continued, "She was married to her soulmate (and) best friend … She's a family person. She's about research and fighting for what she believes in when that takes tremendous courage and it's not popular. Wow. I really, really, really had so much respect for her."
"What a wonderful person," Frankel concluded. "I'm so, so sorry. Sorry to Suzanne's family. What a tremendous loss on such a week of tremendous loss."

Comedian and radio personality Adam Carolla wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that he was "devastated to hear" Somers had died. "A true icon and overall amazing human being. You will be greatly missed, my friend."
Somers battled cancer for over 23 years, and in July, she revealed that her breast cancer had returned. "I have been living with cancer since my 20s. And every time (it) pops up, I continue to bat it back," Somers told "Entertainment Tonight" at the time. "I do my best not to let this insidious disease control me."
The actress was first diagnosed in 2000, and had previously battled skin cancer.
Somers began landing small acting roles in the late 1960s and early 1970s, earning her first credit in the Steve McQueen film "Bullitt." She appeared as the "Blonde in the white Thunderbird" in "American Graffiti," the 1973 coming-of-age drama film directed by George Lucas, as well as brief roles in the first episode of "The Love Boat" and a 1976 episode of "One Day at a Time."
While she appeared in many television shows in the 1970s, including "The Rockford Files," "Magnum Force" and "The Six Million Dollar Man," her most famous part didn't come until she landed the role of Chrissy Snow on the ABC sitcom "Three's Company."
Somers is survived by husband Alan Hamel; her son, Bruce; her stepchildren, Stephen and Leslie; and her six grandchildren. According to her publicist, a private family burial for Somers will take place this week and a memorial will be held in November, People reported.
Somers' husband wrote her a poem the day before her death, according to Hay, per People.
The Canadian entertainer and movie producer, 87, wrote the poem for Somers' birthday but decided to give it to her early. "She read the poem and went to bed and later died peacefully in her sleep," said Hay.
People published the poem in full, written in all caps, which reads, in part: "LOVE I USE IT EVERY DAY, SOMETIMES SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. I USE IT AT THE END OF EMAILS TO MY LOVING FAMILY. I EVEN USE IT IN EMAILS TO CLOSE FRIENDS. I USE IT WHEN I'M LEAVING THE HOUSE.
"I'M BACK TO FEELINGS. THERE ARE NO WORDS. THERE ARE NO ACTIONS. NO PROMISES. NO DECLARATIONS," Hamal concluded. "EVEN THE GREEN SHADED SCHOLARS OF THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS HAVE SPENT 150 YEARS AND STILL HAVE FAILED TO COME UP WITH THAT ONE WORD. SO I WILL CALL IT, 'US', UNIQUELY, MAGICALLY, INDESCRIBABLY WONDERFUL 'US.'"
The couple was married for 46 years, after dating for a decade.

An updated COVID-19 vaccine has been available since last month, and more than 7 million Americans have gotten boosted since then.
But many people are still on the fence about whether and when to get a shot.
Experts say when and whether to get a COVID-19 booster should depend on your health status, risk tolerance, timing of last infection and other personal factors.
The new booster is targeted to the XBB.1.5 variant. Though that variant is no longer in circulation, studies suggest the vaccine will still prevent severe disease from other omicron variants that are more common now, including EG.5, FL.1.5.1, HV.1 and XBB.1.16.6.
Here are a handful of things to think about before heading to an appointment and rolling up your sleeve:
People likely to get very sick if infected should take the most care to be protected, experts say.
Those at highest risk include people with weakened immune systems because of:
Is there something coming up you absolutely can't miss, like a wedding? Or anything three to four months from now?
If the event is coming up, you'll want to get a shot sooner rather than later.
Although initial vaccines took about two weeks to take effect, a booster is likely to take less time because it works as a reminder to a system that's already primed, said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and immunologist, formerly at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
But current vaccines will protect against all infections for only about three months, so if that wedding or big European vacation is more than three or four months away, it's a better idea to put off your booster a little longer, said Mina, who is now chief science officer at eMed.
To avoid infection until then, consider wearing a high-quality mask when you're in a crowded indoor space, like a concert hall, or when you take public transportation.
If you had a case of COVID-19 in late summer or early fall, you'll have protection against another infection for about three to four months, studies suggest.
Protection isn't like a light switch. You won't be safe on Tuesday and vulnerable on Wednesday. It happens gradually.
And it's impossible for experts to predict exactly when that protection will fade enough to leave you vulnerable or unexpectedly exposed to the virus.
This is a big unanswerable question. For the past three years, the holiday season has triggered a spike in cases that peaked each year in January.
But it's unclear whether that pattern will repeat this year.
Unlike the flu, in which cases drop very low during the off-season, COVID-19 has continued to transmit since its first appearance, so it can take off anytime.
There isn't a COVID-19 season, per se. But there have typically been two annual peaks with COVID-19 since its initial spike in early 2020: one in the summer, although this year's stretched on later – possibly because of a sweeping heat wave in July; and one starting around Thanksgiving and ending early in the new year.
Experts don't think the next peak will be as high as it has been in previous winters, just as this summer's peak was not as high as it was in 2020, 2021 or 2022.
The CDC says it's perfectly safe to get the two shots at the same time.
Only you know yourself. If you're the type of person who's not likely to come back for a second shot, seize the moment and get both.
If you've had side effects from one or both ‒ spent a day on the couch after your last COVID-19 booster or had a sore arm for a week after a flu shot ‒ consider putting some space between them, but only if you're the kind of person who will come back for the second one.
No. There's not much difference among the three authorized vaccines. Two, from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are based on mRNA technology, which directs the body to make the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The third, from Novavax, provides the same protein directly.
All three remind the immune system what the spike protein looks like, so when an infection arrives, it will be ready to quickly respond.
If you have had rough side effects after getting an mRNA vaccine, you might consider getting the Novavax shot this time, said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.
As for mixing shots, that has been part of the dialogue since COVID-19 arrived, and now there's more clarity: Studies haven't shown a significant benefit to mixing and matching vaccines.
The short answer is: probably not, as long as you don't mind being sick for a week or two.
People who are young, healthy and have already been infected or vaccinated more than once are very unlikely to get extremely sick or die from COVID-19.
The risk of contracting long COVID, in which symptoms linger for months or longer after an initial infection, has also been shown to be much smaller for people who are vaccinated, particularly those who have had three shots.
For young, healthy people, the main benefit of a COVID-19 booster will be small and short-lived: protection against infection for about three to four months and another hedge against the slight risk of severe disease.
Many people get an annual flu shot, not to avoid death but because they don't want to miss work or life or be miserable for a few weeks. The same is true for COVID-19.
Also, as with the flu, if you don't get infected for those few months, you won't pass that infection on to someone else ‒ which is important for people with older friends or relatives and those who work around vulnerable people.

In August of 1930, Ethel Benson was institutionalized into the Delaware Colony for the Feeble Minded and never returned home.
She was about 20 years old, Black and illiterate. Her great sin, in the eyes of Delaware, was that she was an unmarried woman who gave birth to two children – both fathered by different white men. 
The label of “procreative menace” was often slapped on women like Ethel.
While institutionalized, she underwent a procedure to correct these supposed emotional defects. A doctor, with one of Delaware’s most prominent last names, made an incision into Ethel’s abdomen. He removed both of her fallopian tubes. He also cut out her clitoris. 
Editor's note: Part one of a five-part USA TODAY series revealing why America hasn't solved its long struggle with Type 2 diabetes.
For chef Robin Ray, newly married with young stepchildren, the turning point came when a stabbing chest pain sent her rushing to the emergency room. 
For Brian Castrucci, the gravity hit when the ER doc who had treated him for a near-heart attack a few weeks earlier gave him a big bear hug. “I didn’t think you’d make it,” the doctor said.
The crisis unspooled more slowly for James Haynes but started in 2019 when he stepped on a rusty nail and didn’t notice. 
The moments were turning points for all three to get serious about addressing their diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can’t properly regulate blood sugar, has become so common it’s almost considered inconsequential. More than 1 in 10 Americans have the disease (though many don't know) and another nearly 4 in 10 are at risk for it. In total, half of all adults and a quarter of teenagers have diabetes or pre-diabetes.
Its financial costs are astronomical. The country spends more than $300 billion a year to address diabetes, accounting for $1 out of every $4 spent on health care. 
And its personal tolls are even worse: heart attacks, amputations, blindness, kidney disease, double the risk of premature death. It also causes what’s known as “diabetes distress,” the daily burdens and emotional toll of living with and managing a chronic ailment that can lead to regular dips in energy, foggy thinking and depression, and a sense of isolation.
The most frustrating aspect of Type 2 diabetes, experts say, is that it has long been largely preventable and controllable. 
“We have made tremendous gains in understanding diabetes,” said Dr. Donald Berwick, a pediatrician and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “The best diabetes care can make a very big difference. You can’t say we don’t know what to do.”
And yet, diagnosed rates of Type 2 diabetes have soared over the past 25 years, and especially over the past dozen – particularly among working-age adults like Ray, Castrucci and Haynes. 
Roughly 40% of people who died early in the coronavirus pandemic had Type 2 diabetes, a rate four times higher than people without the disease. Even when elevated blood sugar levels are below the threshold for type 2 diabetes, the risk for heart disease jumps 30% to 50% compared with people with normal blood sugar levels. (Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 5% to 10% of diabetes, is caused by the immune system and is unrelated to diet or lifestyle.)
America’s failure to address Type 2 diabetes highlights larger problems with our food and medical systems, Berwick and other experts said.
A soda costs less than a bottle of water, a double cheeseburger and fries less than a carton of blueberries. Patients wait months for medical appointments only to see the back of a white coat for the short time they’re allotted. Treating disease costs society far more than preventing it but typically provides more profit for insurance companies, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry.
The USA TODAY Health team spoke with scores of health care providers, researchers, community leaders and patients for this five-part series to understand why Type 2 diabetes continues to worsen in America despite known solutions.
The answer isn't simple. It involves systemic problems facing everyone in society, not just those with diabetes: a food system designed to sell products; a medical system in which cutting off a leg is less expensive than saving it; the high cost of healthy living and the fact that breaking habits takes a lot more than just personal willpower.
This first story looks at what it takes for people to cope with or overcome the disease.
Then, we explore one community in a David vs. Goliath battle against a food system that fails to prioritize people's health.

The system is fixable, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.
But it will take "sensible action" from across many sectors, including health care, science, nutrition, business, public health and politics to change the financial and other incentives that drive so many Americans toward sickness instead of health.
"If we do it all, we could fix a lot of this in 10 years," said Mozaffarian, who serves on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. "If we do it incrementally or don't do it at all, we're all going to be toast in 50 years from diet-related illnesses and a depleted environment."
There’s no question personal responsibility plays a role in fighting diabetes. 
Haynes, Ray and Castrucci radically changed their lifestyles and sought help after their come-to-Jesus experiences. They’ve reduced their dependence on daily medication and hope to have saved themselves the horrors of more amputations, blindness and dialysis. They’ve extended their lives and improved the quality of that time.
But like many medical problems, the challenges of diabetes go well beyond individual responsibility and blame. 
“There are structural issues that we have to start paying attention to and addressing,” said Dr. Shivani Agarwal, an endocrinologist who specializes in research and treating young adults with diabetes at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Agarwal recently led a series of studies in the journal The Lancet that looked at diabetes rates around the world. 
Poverty, the studies showed, was a major driver of diabetes, along with racism and unequal access to healthy food and high-quality medical care.
Personal stories illustrate how these structural issues play out in the lives of so many Americans.
Ray, 45, director of culinary operations at HOSCO/North Sarah Food Hub in St. Louis, got weight-loss surgery and then put her culinary expertise to good use.  
Castrucci, 49, who runs a public health nonprofit outside Washington, D.C., used his advantages provided by his work, salary and insurance to “buy” himself better health.
 “I’m healthy because of privilege – not diet, not exercise, not determination,” he said.
Haynes, 58, a former truck driver and maintenance technician in Gulfport, Mississippi, has fewer material assets, but his attitude and the advantages he does have explain why he's still around, despite all he has been through.
“It’s going to be all right after a while, as long as I keep this spirit,” he said.
Ray’s love for food began when she was 8 years old, watching Julia Child on TV. During family gatherings, she would run around taking everyone’s dinner order. Then she’d scurry back to the kitchen with a notepad full of scribbles. 
Throughout her life, she made fried chicken, pork chops, baked mac and cheese, collard greens, and even a whole roasted chicken filled with wild rice and two sticks of butter – everything that made her soul sing. 
In her world, food was home. Food was family. Food was love. 
But that was some pretty tough love. 
In 2002, Ray was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Her father, grandmother, aunts and uncles all had diabetes. She knew what it meant.
“For you to tell me I can’t have ice blue raspberry Kool-Aid was like you shut down my world,” Ray said. “I didn’t want to accept it. So, I ate, because you eat through your emotions.” 
She didn't dwell on the diagnosis and continued with life. Her culinary career took her to Italy, where she learned and fell even more in love with food. She returned to St. Louis, got married and became a mom to her husband’s two children ‒ “beautiful bonus babies,” as she described them. Through the years, she continued to express love through cooking and eating. 
In 2015, a stabbing chest pain sent her to the emergency room. Doctors assured Ray she hadn’t had a heart attack, but they warned that her life was on the line. At 5-foot-2, she weighed 334 pounds and had an A1C, a measure of average blood sugar of 11%, well above the 6.5% cutoff to be considered diabetic. Her diabetes – and her diet – were out of control. 
“That scared me. … It was gut-wrenching and terrifying,” she said. “I’m fighting against something that’s fighting me back and I did not know how to win.” 
She and her primary care doctor decided she would pursue weight loss surgery. 
But she also decided to use her culinary prowess to transform her diet. She reconfigured favorite foods, substituting healthier ingredients: Collard greens cooked in smoked fats or ham hocks turned into a kale, turnip and rutabaga recipe flavored with natural chicken broth fat, oils and seasonings. 
She fostered her feelings into new recipes and brought them to North Sarah Food Hub, which partnered with Barnes-Jewish Hospital to make packaged, pre-made meals for St. Louis residents with diabetes and limited access to fresh food.
“I had to restructure the food that I put in my mouth. I had to think about what I was eating and how I was eating and how it was going to be good for my body,” she said. “I became excited about food again, and food became a joy.” 
It isn’t always easy, of course. Ray admits to an occasional cookie craving. But now she takes the time to think about how her body processes that cookie and whether it’s worthwhile. 
She hopes her cooking can help other people make the same transformation she did. Her staff at North Sarah helps her create new recipes for others. She wants to provide nourishment that allows people to avoid illness and medicine. 
“Nobody wants to take 55 pills, nobody wants to feel like a patient, but how do you fix that? It’s by our food,” she said. “That should be what we’re teaching our community and our culture and our children. … It’s not always about the macaroni noodle with a smile, it’s about what’s good for your body.” 
Castrucci is a third-generation diabetes patient. The lifetime risk of developing Type 2 diabetes if a parent has it is 40%. If both parents have it, the risk jumps to 70%.
He knew he was at risk, but he pushed his luck, he said, by eating poorly during the pandemic and falling out of his exercise routine. With the luxury of working from home, walking to the kitchen and bathroom was often the extent of his daily activity.
On Feb. 14, 2022 – Valentine’s Day – he went to an urgent care clinic, concerned his breathing trouble meant he had bronchitis. His blood pressure measured 210 over 110, well above normal levels that top out at 120 over 80. A chest X-ray showed fluid filling his lungs, leading to congestive heart failure. 
The clinic sent him straight to a local emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a blockage of the left descending artery – a clogged artery made worse by diabetes. If he had waited any longer, he would have had a massive heart attack, his doctor later told him.
After his release from the hospital, he went to the drugstore to fill his new prescriptions. The pharmacist told him she couldn’t fill one because it would cost $1,000. He’d have to wait until his insurance approved it. “Please fill it,” he said. She stressed the cost. “Fill it,” he pleaded, putting the charge on his credit card.
Medication helped him lose 70 pounds in three months. When his local drugstore ran out of the weight-loss drug, he easily drove to another pharmacy and then another to find what he needed. 
His 100 hours of high-quality cardiac rehabilitation were fully covered by insurance.  
"For my midlife crisis, I got healthy," Castrucci said.
He could devote all his energy to getting well because he didn’t have to focus on how to afford his care. “(I) paid almost nothing for the whole episode,” he said, “and never worried about it because I have really good insurance.” 
Even so, Castrucci pays out-of-pocket for a cardiologist and an endocrinologist because the best ones near him don’t accept insurance.
Every time he goes to Walgreens to refill his medications, Castrucci said, he sees someone turned away because they can’t afford their prescriptions. When they finally show up in the emergency room, “because they will,” they will cost the system far more, he said.
“Health outcomes are dictated by economics. It’s a whole side of privilege that we don’t always talk about.”
On the day Haynes stepped on a rusty nail in 2019, he walked all day as the nail pierced the sole of his sneaker and then his foot. By the time he took off his shoe that night, his foot was infected. He landed in the hospital for two months as doctors and nurses tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to get the infection and Haynes’ blood sugar under control.
By the time he was released, he knew enough about Type 2 diabetes to realize his daily blood sugar levels – typically in the mid-400s – were four times above what he had been told to shoot for.
But nothing he did or ate seemed to make a difference. He had long since traded ribs for salads, beer for water. 
His wife, Angela, barely noticed when James started wearing multiple pairs of socks, pouring powder on his feet and buying bigger shoes. His feet tingled a lot, he said, but he was coping with it. 
James ended up in the emergency room again, dehydrated and in need of antibiotics. The doctor amputated the baby toe on his right foot, leaving a large open wound. 
"We're going to leave this open because we'll probably have to take more,” Angela remembered the doctor saying. “I didn't like that we're not going to try to save anything, we're just going to start cutting.”
James was fading.
His arm muscles shriveled and he lost his Popeye physique. Antibiotics left him looking sickly, his voice so weak Angela could barely hear him. “I felt like I was watching my husband slowly dying,” she said.
Finally, taking her doctor sister’s advice, Angela emailed Dr. Foluso Fakorede’s office to ask for an appointment. She thought it would take months to get James in to see the heart disease specialist, but the office called and asked if they could come the next day. 
The Hayneses would end up going back to see Fakorede many times − sometimes twice in one week, driving more than five hours each way from Gulfport north to Cleveland, Mississippi.
“We started looking forward to these visits because there was always hope,” Angela Haynes said, though she felt guilty they were taking up so much of the important doctor’s time. 
Fakorede, who is on a personal mission to save people with diabetes from amputations, noticed what other doctors had missed. Haynes had blockages in blood vessels on both legs. 
Once he got the blood flowing again, Haynes began to feel better. His flesh returned to its normal color. The wound started healing at last. Walking became easier.
Then disaster struck again. 
On July 2, 2022, Haynes caught COVID-19. "Everything went downhill after that," he said.
During his 13-day illness, the bacteria in his foot raged out of control. He ended up back in the hospital and unable to withstand the long drive to Fakorede’s office.
Every week, a surgeon would come to the door of his hospital room and before even stepping all the way in ask Haynes whether he had decided to get his leg amputated. 
"This is my leg. I was born with this. And you're walking in like you're cutting a piece of cake," Haynes said.
He was worried about how he’d get around, how he’d be able to work to support his family if he had only one leg. No one took the time to explain why they thought the leg needed to come off or how he’d cope without it, Haynes said. 
In late November, he was finally sent home in a wheelchair. But just three weeks later, as he was getting out of the car after wound care, his right leg gave out and he fell to the ground. Back at the hospital, Haynes was told his foot was broken, essentially beyond repair. He agreed to a below-the-knee amputation.
Released right before Christmas, he spent the next three weeks in bed wondering how he’d manage the rest of his life.
Finally, it looked as if his luck might be turning around.
With the leg gone, his diabetes improved. His blood sugar dropped into the 120s or one-teens. His blurry vision cleared up.
During his long hospital stay, he befriended nurses and learned about a program for people who needed prostheses. The man who ran it called early in the year and said he had received a donated leg. If it fit Haynes, he could have it while waiting for insurance to pay for a personalized one. Miraculously, it did. 
Haynes spent the next six months teaching himself to walk again. The donor leg was heavy and uncomfortable. He wasn't mobile enough to hold down a job.
One late spring night, picking up dinner at a nearby restaurant, he headed to the bathroom for a pit stop. A sink had been leaking all day and Haynes slipped in the puddle, falling backward.
He's still recovering from the resulting wrist surgery.
He and Angela are living – barely – off her part-time salary as a secretary and a church organist.
Haynes has tried "at least three or four times" to receive government assistance, but they keep losing his paperwork, or not believing he's disabled, though he once checked himself out of the hospital and arrived at an appointment in his wheelchair to prove he didn't have a leg.
Still, he clings to his faith and the positive attitude he has long used to cheer up himself and others. These are his secret weapons against diabetes and everything else life throws his way.
"I try to put a smile on other people's faces," he said. "It keeps my day going."

The USA TODAY Best-selling Booklist is back!
After a brief hiatus, USA TODAY’s beloved bestsellers list has returned with the features and characteristics that have long made it the People’s Booklist.
Our goal remains the same: Provide book lovers with the best, most accurate snapshot of what people are reading by showing which titles are selling. It is a master list, unbound by genre and format, of what’s selling broadly across the U.S.
“I am so thrilled that the USA Today Best-selling Booklist is coming back!" says bestselling author Colleen Hoover in a statement. "It gives so many authors the wonderful opportunity to be recognized as bestsellers and for readers to discover their next favorite book.”
Hoover, the self-published writer turned bestselling powerhouse who's authored dozens of novels including "It Ends With Us" and "Verity," was the undisputed queen of the Booklist in 2022 and spent weeks atop the list. Her novel "It Starts With Us" claimed the No. 1 spot in its first week, her highest debut ever, selling more than 800,000 copies on its first day of sales. It was her fourth book to hit No. 1 in 2022.
Check out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist
The USA TODAY list is a ranking of the top-selling titles each week from a broad range of businesses including major chains, independent bookstores and online retailers. It reflects combined sales of titles in print and electronic format, if available. Our data team weighs and compiles those numbers to generate the week's 150 top-selling titles. The rankings reflect sales from the previous Monday through Sunday. The full list will publish online at 6 a.m. Wednesdays, with the top 50 titles publishing in print Thursdays.
The list, which began in 1993, went on hiatus in December. It is the longest-running USA TODAY data journalism project.
In our continued commitment to bring readers more books coverage, USA TODAY is also excited to announce a new content partnership with The Novel Neighbor, an independently owned and operated bookstore in St. Louis. They are expert booksellers and passionate readers who are deeply connected to what their community is reading. With the partnership will come regular profiles of independent bookstores across the country, highlighting the important role of these businesses in their local communities. Novel Neighbor will also be sharing expert book recommendations and fun takes on book trends.

A second U.S. aircraft carrier strike force will join a group of six American warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea in a growing military response to the attack on Israel by Hamas.
The five-ship USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Strike Group will bolster the five ships headed by the USS Gerald R. Ford, the U.S. Navy’s largest and most advanced nuclear aircraft carrier, the Pentagon said Saturday. The Ford strike group arrived Tuesday.
Why are the 11 ships there and what can they do?
"As laid out by the Secretary of Defense, their guidance is make sure that there's no escalation around Israel," says Peter Daly, retired U.S. Navy vice admiral and CEO of the U.S. Naval Institute.
"Their mission, as stated by the DOD, is to not let the neighbors join the party."
Military moves like this are often considered a show of force. Though the Navy vessels can defend themselves if fired upon, they can’t initiate an attack without authorization.
The Eisenhower strike group left its homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday. It's joining the Ford strike group, "to deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war following Hamas's attack on Israel," Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said Saturday.
The Ford strike group, based in Norfolk, Virginia, was conducting naval exercises with Italy in the Ionian Sea last week. Austin ordered the group's repositioning on Sunday.
The Eisenhower was scheduled to deploy to the Mediterranean on a regular rotation, and the Ford is near the end of its deployment, the Associated Press reported. But the Biden administration may decide to extend the Ford’s deployment and keep both strike groups out there, White House spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday.
Strike group options include:
Much of this isn't new. The U.S. and Israel have a history of sharing intelligence and information, Daly says. "It goes both ways."
The guided missile cruiser and destroyers also could help defend Israel from missile attacks from Iran, according to Breakingdefense.com. But the ships can’t offer adequate protection against attacks from Gaza or Lebanon, Breakingdefense said.
Against Iran, "the surface ships have that capability," Daly says. The guided missile cruiser and three guided missile destroyers can "engage medium range ballistic missiles, the class of weapon Iran would use."
Rocket attacks from Gaza against Israel are a different matter. Strike group weapons systems aren't designed to protect a wide area of land, as Israel's Iron Dome system is. Strike group systems "are not not optimized to do that," Daly says.
The strike groups also can help evacuate Americans from Israel if conditions worsen and airports close. About 200,000 Americans, most of whom have dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, are in Israel.
However, the Navy has other ships in the region that would take the lead in evacuations. "One of them is the USS Mesa Verde," Daly says. "There are about 800 Marines on it."
"It has that perfect capability, an amphibious ready group and amphibious ship with helicopters," Daly says. "The Marines are trained for noncombat evacuation operations."
Other evacuation ships include the USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall.
The USS Gerald R. Ford, CVN 78, is a $13 billion aircraft carrier with a crew of 5,000. It carries up to 90 attack and support aircraft in eight squadrons. The deployment is the carrier's first. Its fleet of aircraft includes:
Those are in addition to unmanned air and combat vehicles.
The Ford strike group ships are:
USS Normandy, CG 60: A Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser.
USS Thomas Hudner, DDG 116: An Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer.
USS Ramage, DDG 61: An Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer.
USS Carney, DDG 64: An Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer.
USS Roosevelt, DDG 80: An Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer.
The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, CVN-69, is a nuclear powered Nimitz-class aircraft carrier and is the Navy's second-oldest carrier. It carries a crew of 5,600 and 90 aircraft.
Ships in its strike group include:
USS Philippine Sea, CG 58: A Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser.
USS Gravely, DDG 107: An Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer.
USS Mason, DDG 87: An Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer.
USS Laboon, DDG-58: An Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer.
The strike group includes Carrier Air Wing 3, nine squadrons with more than 70 aircraft.

An Oct. 11 Facebook post (direct link, archive link) shows a photo of Qatar's head of state along with a warning he supposedly made about his country’s energy exports.
“The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, has threatened that if the bombing of Gaza does not stop, he will cut off the supply of gas to the world,” reads both the caption and the text in the post.
The post was shared more than 60 times in five days.

A disinformation expert in Qatar says the emir has not made such a threat, and there are no credible reports of one.
The claim is “100% false,” a Qatar-based expert on Middle Eastern studies and disinformation campaigns told USA TODAY.
“The emir has not said anything of the sort,” Marc Owen Jones, an associate professor at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Doha, the capital of Qatar, said in an email.
Qatar was the world’s third-largest liquefied natural gas exporter during the first half of 2023, behind the U.S. and Australia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Fact check: False claim that Qatar rejected German plane for LGBTQ symbol
So a legitimate threat that one of its leaders would shut off its natural gas valve certainly would have made global headlines. But no credible news outlets have reported it.
In fact, on the same day the post was made, France said it would buy up to 3.5 million tons of liquefied natural gas from Qatar each year through 2050. A day later, the emir visited Germany – which last year said it would import up to 2 million tons each year – amid criticism of Qatar’s ties to the Palestinian militant group Hamas, Politico reported.
Hamas’ attack on southern Israeli towns near the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7 led to the start of its latest war with Israel. The conflict has left more than 4,000 dead on both sides, including 30 Americans, as of Oct. 16.
Qatar is seen as being a major sponsor of Hamas, Politico reported, but Qatari officials deny that, saying aid for Gaza is intended to improve life for Palestinians.
Any threat about withholding gas was not discussed during a joint news conference held Oct. 13 by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the Qatari prime minister.
The claim originated in an Oct. 11 post on X from an account purporting to cover Qatari affairs, but it attributed the threat to the state of Qatar, not the emir. The account has since been suspended. It is not an official channel, and Jones said another version of the account was suspended previously.
USA TODAY reached out to both the Qatar embassy in Washington and the emir but did not immediately receive responses from either.
Qatar vowed in 2017 to not cut the gas supply to the United Arab Emirates even as that nation and others in the region severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and accused it of harboring terrorists, charges it has repeatedly denied. The CEO of state-run Qatar Petroleum, Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, said the country would not halt supplies “to its brothers,” Al Jazeera reported at the time.
During that diplomatic crisis, which lasted until 2021 and included a blockade, a number of accounts also appeared on the platform and spread misinformation about Qatar, Jones said.

More celebrities are reacting to the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, where the death toll on both sides surpassed 4,000 on Monday, with thousands more wounded.
Pink and Riz Ahmed posted statements on social media as the world braced Monday for an expected Israeli ground invasion of Gaza aimed at crushing Hamas. Meanwhile, the Academy Museum Gala postponed its annual fundraiser, and a red carpet for the upcoming Sofia Coppola film "Priscilla" has been canceled.
Last week, over 700 actors, comedians, musicians, and power players of the Hollywood community signed an open letter denouncing Hamas' "barbaric acts of terrorism" in Israel and calling for the return of hostages.
Here's what more celebrities are saying.
Oscar-winning British actor and rapper Riz Ahmed called for the end of the "indiscriminate bombing of Gaza's civilians and vital infrastructure, the denial of food, water, and electricity, and the forced displacement of people from their homes" on his social media platforms.
"These are indefensible war crimes," he continued. "We need to put ourselves in the shoes of the people of Gaza, now, before we all walk past the point of no return."
The "Sound of Metal" actor also denounced the actions of Hamas, calling the attack "horrific and wrong."
Pink, who is currently on the North American leg of her Summer Carnival tour, claimed in an X post that she has received "many threats" from people who mistook Poi flags displayed at her live shows for Israeli flags. The singer clarified that the flags "were used many, many years ago by the Māori people in New Zealand and because they and the Māori people are beautiful to me, we use them."
"I have been using Poi flags since the beginning of this tour," she said. "I do not fly flags in my show in support of anything or anyone except the rainbow flag. That will remain my position."
She continued, "I am a human. I believe in peace. Equality. Love. I am deeply saddened by the state of the world. I pray for all of us."
The war has caused reverberations in Hollywood, too.
On Oct. 12, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles announced the red carpet for its annual fundraising gala on Oct. 14 would be canceled "out of respect for the devastating conflict and loss of life happening overseas."
"The Academy Museum condemns all forms of hate and cruelty and stands in support of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives affected by the ongoing violence," the museum's statement reads.
Meryl Streep, Oprah Winfrey, Michael B. Jordan and Sofia Coppola were set to be honored at the event.
Similarly, the red-carpet premiere for the Sofia Coppola film "Priscilla," which is based on the love story of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, was canceled in response to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," A24 Films confirmed to USA TODAY in an email.
"Out of respect for the events going on in the world, we will be forgoing a red carpet for the 'Priscilla' Los Angeles premiere," the studio said in an email to the press.
'Horrific':Gal Gadot, Gigi Hadid, Kim Kardashian support Israel amid Palestinian conflict
One of the world's most enduring and intractable conflicts connects to a century of competing claims to land, borders and rights in a region of deep historical and religious significance.
The United Nations in 1947 tried to divide the-then British Mandate of Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states. A year later, when the state of Israel was created, the first Arab-Israeli War broke out. Ever since Israel's victory and following several other wars, Palestinians have gradually been displaced from territory that they also see as their rightful homeland.

A Royal Caribbean International cruise ship helped evacuate U.S. nationals from Israel on Monday.
The line’s Rhapsody of the Seas vessel had been sailing in the region but canceled its itineraries in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.
“Now, with enhanced safety precautions in place, our ship is providing free passage, including accommodation and food, for Americans in the region wishing to leave and find safer ground,” Jason Liberty, president and CEO of the line’s parent company Royal Caribbean Group, said in an email to employees that was shared with USA TODAY.
The evacuation was conducted in partnership with the U.S. State Department, Liberty said. The U.S. Embassy in Israel said in a security alert Sunday that boarding would begin in order of arrival on Monday at 8:00 a.m. local time, and the ship would sail from Haifa to Limassol, Cyprus.
The Rhapsody of the Seas ship can accommodate more than 2,400 passengers, according to Royal Caribbean’s website.
“Each traveler must be a U.S. national or the immediate family member (spouse/partner, children under age 21) of a U.S. national and have a valid passport,” the alert said. The embassy said travelers would be responsible for arranging their own accommodations and travel from Cyprus, but that chartered flights were also being arranged.
“This has truly been an incredible effort as our teams worked tirelessly over the past week to make this mission possible,” Liberty added in the email. “My heartfelt gratitude goes out to all involved and especially to the ship’s officers and crew for their unwavering support of this call to serve others in the midst of unimaginable tragedy.”

Many cruise lines changed itineraries following the conflict, in some cases suspending stops in Israel altogether. The State Department has an advisory in place for the region, warning against travel to Gaza and urging travelers to reconsider going to Israel and the West Bank.

An Oct. 10 Facebook post (direct link, archive link) claims an Israeli government official made a stark comment amid the Israel-Hamas war. 
“Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant: ‘The Israeli army is launching a full-scale offensive on the Gaza Strip,’” reads the post. “We have abolished all the rules of war. Our soldiers will not be held accountable for anything. There will be no military courts.” 
It was shared more than 40 times in four days. Other versions of the claim accumulated thousands of additional shares across Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter.

There is no evidence Gallant said this. Versions of the claim reference Gallant's message to Israeli troops along the Gaza border, but media accounts of those remarks include no mention of abolishing the rules of war.
Some versions of the claim include a lengthier quotation attributed to Gallant. It says Israel is “moving to a full offense” and “Hamas wanted a change in Gaza, it will change 180 degrees from what it thought.” 
Those comments roughly match Gallant’s message to troops along the Gaza border on Oct. 10, as reported by the Times of Israel. He says:
There is no reference to Israel abandoning the rules of war in the remarks. Though some versions of the claim attributed the supposed quote to Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik, there is no such quotation in any of the outlet’s articles on Gallant. 
Fact check: Historic Gaza church open for services, undamaged by Israeli airstrikes 
Both Israel and Hamas have been criticized for possible violations of the rules of war, including killing civilians and taking them as hostages, Reuters reported. Israel has also been criticized for preventing food, water, medicine and fuel from entering Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. 
A United Nations commission said it has been “collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes committed by all sides,” the Associated Press reported. 
President Joe Biden has also urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to observe the rules of war in retaliating against Hamas, according to outlets including CNN, the Hill and PBS. 
USA TODAY has debunked an array of false claims about the Israel-Hamas war, including that a video showed Russian President Vladimir Putin warning the U.S. to not interfere in the conflict, that the Department of Defense evacuated the U.S. embassy in Beirut and told Americans to leave Lebanon immediately and that a video shows Israel fabricating a child’s injuries. 
USA TODAY reached out to several users who shared the post for comment but did not immediately receive a response.
Lead Stories also debunked the claim.

A black ski mask conceals the man’s face.
The anonymous YouTube channel host almost always sports a black baseball cap embellished with the channel’s logo above his mask. The hat depicts a stylized orange and red emblem of a desert vista with the words “aventuras por el desierto,” meaning adventures through the desert.
The channel had nearly 9,000 subscribers and a catalog of 180 videos that offered advice, stories and tips on the process of crossing the Arizona-Mexico border.
Videos walked viewers through how much they would have to pay in smuggling fees and advice on how to cross without a guide or “coyote.”
In August of 1930, Ethel Benson was institutionalized into the Delaware Colony for the Feeble Minded and never returned home.
She was about 20 years old, Black and illiterate. Her great sin, in the eyes of Delaware, was that she was an unmarried woman who gave birth to two children – both fathered by different white men. 
The label of “procreative menace” was often slapped on women like Ethel.
While institutionalized, she underwent a procedure to correct these supposed emotional defects. A doctor, with one of Delaware’s most prominent last names, made an incision into Ethel’s abdomen. He removed both of her fallopian tubes. He also cut out her clitoris. 
A comical but telling moment Thursday at the end of Ben Johnson’s weekly news conference said a lot about his success and his skyrocketing stock as a future head coach.
After the Detroit Lions' offensive coordinator was done fielding questions, which were mostly about his play-calling wizardry that has produced 76 points in two weeks, he began to walk off the podium before he briefly posed his own query.

LAS VEGAS – Well, at least one thing hasn’t changed when it comes to the Patriot Way.
When he loses, nobody does grumpy quite like Bill Belichick.
And there’s been so much of that lately.
"One of a number of things could have made a difference," Belichick said after the 21-17 setback against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday marked a third consecutive loss. "We just need to coach it better, play it better, execute it better. That’s really the story again."
If only it were that simple.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
This time, the Patriots – blown out by an aggregate score of 72-3 the previous two games – actually had a chance to pull out a win at the end at Allegiant Stadium. They didn’t quit, cave or fold up the tent. But they wound up with the same lousy result.
And the story again is that New England just isn’t good enough anymore.
The Patriots are 1-5. That’s another first under Belichick, another in a series of firsts for futility.
Here’s another one: The Patriots had a grand total of -2 net yards in the first quarter. Until Sunday, they had never had a first quarter with zero yards or less. Ouch.
The last time they were 1-5? Go back to 1995 – the year after Robert Kraft bought the franchise.
If you’re into train wrecks or just down for seeing a Belichick team suffer, the pristine palace that will host Super Bowl 58 in February was the place. Funny, the team wore the New England uniforms. But somewhere along the way – or sometime after Tom Brady departed – they changed the definition of the Patriot Way.
Remember how it used to be? Belichick’s team, resourceful and on-point when it came to situational football, used to be the ones to capitalize on the mistakes of others. During those glory years spanning two decades, they often came back because they could count on the other guys screwing up in crunch time.
Now, with Sunday providing another example, the shoe is other the other foot.
Start with this: The Patriots committed 10 penalties for 79 yards. This is the undisciplined stuff that facilitates losing football games. The flags came early, as in two penalties on two linemen on the first two offensive snaps. And they came late, as in three penalties in the final three minutes. A defensive pass interference call on third down extended a Raiders drive, then after New England forced a punt, holding and delay-of-game penalties backed up the offense and set up the disaster of a game-clinching safety with 1:47 remaining as Mac Jones was sacked in the end zone.
There was also a sweet catch-and-run by Ezekiel Elliott in the second quarter that went for a 74-yard touchdown…until it was called back by a holding penalty.
Yeah, there’s another type of Patriot Way showing up these days.
Jones, the third-year quarterback, led a promising drive into Raiders territory late in the second quarter that might have tied the game. Then as he rolled away from pursuit on a second down, he threw across his body and way the head of tight end Hunter Henry. Tre’von Moehrig intercepted the gift to snuff out that threat.
"Just trying to do too much," said Jones, who passed for 200 yards but didn’t throw for a TD.
Late in the game, two snaps before the safety, Jones threw a deep dime to DeVante Parker, who ran a go route along the left sideline. The football glanced off Parker’s hands, the receiver blowing an opportunity to at least position for a possible go-ahead field goal.
The collection of gaffes is more stunning when considering the man in charge. For a coach who has preached details while enjoying so much success – including six Super Bowl championships with the Patriots – this has to turn his stomach to watch. What a way to achieve a milestone, as Belichick coached in his 500th NFL game, including playoffs, on Sunday.
Asked afterward whether he is taking this Patriots slide personally, Belichick grumbled.
"Right now, it’s just about this game," he said.
Belichick pushed back on the notion that the same types of miscues have been repeated rather than corrected.
"This game was a lot different than the last two games," he maintained. "So, you can’t compare those."
No, the Patriots weren’t blown out against a team coached by a protégé, Josh McDaniels, who previously served as Belichick’s offensive coordinator, and quarterbacked by two other ex-Patriots – Jimmy Garoppolo and Brian Hoyer (Garoppolo didn’t play after halftime due to a back injury, for which he was taken to a hospital for tests).
There was a measure of progress. Yet just like last week and the week before, the Patriots are left to process their reality.
As Jones put it, “You’ve got to watch the film with truthful eyes.”
There’s a lot of football left. That can be interpreted as half-full or half-empty. If the losing continues, the questions about the team’s focus and intensity will escalate.
"It’s up to us to look ourselves in the mirror and see who we are individually and what are we going to bring every day," said receiver Kendrick Bourne, who caught 10 passes for 89 yards on Sunday. "Are we going to quit, come to work just to work? Or are we going to come to work to really work with good effort so we can change things around?"
The morale is certainly being tested, if it isn’t shaken. David Andrews, the ninth-year veteran center, is the only starter on offense or defense who remains from the last Super Bowl title team. He doesn’t see much choice when it comes to the approach to this crisis.
"Football is like life," Andrews said. "There’s highs, there’s lows, there’s in-between. When there’s lows, the only thing you do is fight your way out of it. You can’t lay down. You can’t quit. I don’t believe in that. Never believed in that. So, the only thing you can do is keep fighting, keep throwing punches, keep swinging."
And lately, keep getting off the mat as another version of the Patriot Way.
Week 6 in the NFL brought some stunning upsets, including a pair that unseated the last remaining undefeated teams.
The San Francisco 49ers were facing a Cleveland Browns team that was missing Deshaun Watson and Nick Chubb, but rainy conditions, a poor game from Brock Purdy and missed field goals sunk the Niners.
In New Jersey, the Jets rode their defense to four turnovers, including uncharacteristic interceptions from Jalen Hurts, to take down the Philadelphia Eagles.
Elsewhere in the NFC, a team that had been waiting a long time to contend, the Detroit Lions, are balanced, versatile and looking poised to make a run.
Here are the winners and losers from Sunday of Week 6.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
On the back of an aggressive defense, the Jacksonville Jaguars (4-2) took down the Indianapolis Colts 37-20 for a season sweep against their AFC South rivals. That gives Jacksonville a nice bump in the race for the division title, but if there’s any indication that that Jaguars may stick around, it’s the team’s turnover differential of +7, which ranks second in the NFL. Jacksonville leads the NFL in takeaways with 15. By comparison, the Jaguars had 27 last season, tied for fourth-best.
Their four takeaways against the Colts helped them build an early lead. Jacksonville still allows far too many explosive passing plays (it allowed three completions of 40 or more yards Sunday) and will need to limit those moving forward. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence has been solid and running back Travis Etienne ranks sixth in the league in rushing yards (451), but it’s Jacksonville’s propensity to create turnovers that gives it the ability to win any given week.
The Lions (5-1), as the only team in the NFC North with a winning record, are running away with the division. They have a two-and-a-half game lead on the next closest team. They are balanced, with an offense capable of explosive fits and a defense that limits big plays. What makes Detroit so fun to watch is that it is versatile enough to win in different ways. And its players are maximizing effort, too.
In a 20-6 road win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, quarterback Jared Goff lit up the box score to the tune of 353 yards and a pair of touchdowns. In previous weeks, it had been David Montgomery and the rushing game posting big numbers. The defense has been steadily productive and limited Tampa Bay to two third-down conversions and no red=zone touchdowns on two tries. For the first time since 1969, the Lions have won four straight games by 14 points or more. More may be coming.
New York was without its two starting cornerbacks, Sauce Garnder — one of the finest in the NFL — and D.J. Reed. It was still missing Aaron Rodgers, yet the Jets defeated the Eagles 20-14 for the first time in franchise history. Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts has been in the MVP conversation. New York, however, intercepted Hurts three times and pressured him on 21 of 50 dropbacks (42%).
The Jets (3-3) are hanging around in the AFC East, though the offense with Zach Wilson (19-of-33 for 186 yards) under center remains anemic. The Jets converted just two-of-11 third-down attempts (18.2%). They went just one-of-four in the red zone. Those numbers alone make it remarkable that New York upset the Eagles, but it also shows the proficiency of the defense. This was a statement victory. But unless the offense eventually shows it can bear some weight, this style will prove unsustainable.
By no means is he a finished product, and he still needs to sustain this production over a longer sample size, but second-year Washington Commanders quarterback Sam Howell is taking steps toward becoming a reliable option. Howell, 23, ranks ninth in the NFL in passing (1,500 yards) and is posting an above-average completion rate (67.8%).
In a 24-16 win against the Atlanta Falcons, Howell recorded his first three-touchdown game. He also did it against a team that came into Sunday with the eighth-ranked passing defense (190.8 yards per game allowed). Yet, what has made Howell’s performance this year so impressive is that he’s doing it behind a tattered Washington (3-3) offensive line that has yielded more sacks (34) than any other in the NFL. Some of those sacks, of course, are on Howell, but his ability to evade pressure and release the ball quickly should give him some staying power in the league.
San Francisco, the most consistent team in the league thus far, failed to seize opportunities against the Browns in a 19-17 defeat. And while a pair of missed field goals loom large, second-year quarterback Brock Purdy played the worst game of his career. Rookie third-round place kicker Jake Moody pushed a 41-yard field goal that would have won the game, and he also hooked a 54-yarder in the first quarter. The one in the opening frame came after linebacker Fred Warner returned an interception to the Cleveland 26-yard line; with that short of a field, the Niners (5-1) should’ve done far more with that drive, anyway.
This was a game in which P.J. Walker started at quarterback for the Browns, who were also Chubb, their longtime offensive engine. The only score for San Francisco after the second quarter was after Walker’s second interception gifted the Niners the ball on the 8-yard line. Purdy (12-of-27 for 125 yards and one touchdown with one interception) struggled, and now offensive stars Christian McCaffrey and Deebo Samuel are banged up.
This was always going to be a tough ask, upsetting the Buffalo Bills on the road with backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor starting. But New York (1-5) settled for a pair of field goals Sunday night after it had marched the ball down to Buffalo’s 11-yard line and failed miserably in the red zone.
There was the end of the first half, when New York got it down to the Bills’ 1-yard line. But with no timeouts and with the clock at 14 seconds, Taylor appeared to audible into a run play for Saquon Barkley. It was stopped short, the clock bled and the Giants couldn’t come away with any points. Then there was the final play of the game, an untimed down with the Giants again at the Buffalo 1-yard line. This time New York did opt to pass, but the attempt fell incomplete, cementing a 14-9 loss. New York ended the game 0-for-5 in red zone tries and 0-for-3 in goal-to-go spots. Against weaker teams, maybe those missteps aren't fatal. Against the Bills, you’re asking to lose.
The Seattle Seahawks outgained the Cincinnati Bengals by a margin of 381-214. They recorded 24 first downs to Cincinnati’s 15. They held the ball for eight more minutes. Yet in a 17-13 loss, Seattle (3-2) was done by quarterback Geno Smith's interceptions and the offense's inability to punch the ball in the end zone.
Smith did throw for 323 yards, but he also tossed a red zone interception at the start of the second half and another at the start of the fourth, after the Seahawks had whittled the Cincy lead down. But Seattle was just 1-of-5 in red-zone situations, including 1-of-4 in goal-to-go scenarios. The Seahawks had a couple of shots at the end zone inside the four-minute mark in the fourth quarter. The first time, Smith was sacked twice in four plays. The second, he couldn’t connect with receiver DK Metcalf twice for the game-winning touchdown. All in all, it wasted a solid defensive performance.
With Mike Vrabel as their head coach, the Tennessee Titans have been — for the most part — consistent. They’ve had a winning record in four of the last five years. Tennessee has claimed the division twice and has made three trips to the postseason.
Now, as it heads home from London after a 24-16 setback against the Baltimore Ravens and goes into the bye week with a 2-4 record and sitting in last place, Tennessee faces a crossroads. That’s primarily because quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who has been the starter since 2019, is no longer suitable to direct this offense. Tannehill, 35, was carted off with an ankle injury against the Ravens, but he has been ineffective even when healthy. He was never a star in Tennessee, but the offense was at its best when he could play turnover-free, clean football. He has a 2:6 touchdown-to-interception ratio this year and is on pace for a career-low 71.9 QB rating. It might be time to look to the future.
The 32 things we learned from Week 6 of the 2023 NFL season:
0. The number of undefeated teams remaining, the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers both suffering stunning upsets Sunday. It’s obviously still early in the season, but boy does this field feel wide, wide open.
1. Are the Niners still the NFL’s top squad? Power rankings won’t be revealed until Tuesday morning, and the depleted NFC West leaders went down in Cleveland, their 15-game regular-season winning streak snapped. But they barely lost to the Browns, who entered Sunday with the league’s top-ranked defense, despite RB Christian McCaffrey, WR Deebo Samuel and LT Trent Williams all getting banged up.
1a. San Francisco QB Brock Purdy played poorly (12-for-27, 125 yards, TD, INT) while suffering his first loss in 11 regular-season starts. His only other professional defeat occurred in the 2022 NFC title game, when he missed most of the contest with an injured throwing elbow.
1b. The 49ers’ 17 points were their fewest since a 13-0 win against the New Orleans Saints on Nov. 27, the last game QB Jimmy Garoppolo started and finished for San Francisco.
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
1c. Before leaving with an oblique injury, McCaffrey scored a touchdown in his 15th consecutive game (including playoffs), tying him for the second-longest streak in league history. He needs to extend his run another two games to catch Baltimore Colts legend Lenny Moore.
2. The Niners have scored on the opening possession of all six of their games this season.
2a. McCaffrey’s TD marked the first time the Browns defense had surrendered points to an opponent on its first possession this season.
3. And maybe SF is 6-0 if deadeye free agent Robbie Gould is attempting that go-ahead 41-yard field goal in the final seconds rather than rookie Jake Moody, who pushed it right. You wonder if going with Moody, one of five kickers since 2000 selected in the draft’s first three rounds, will be a miscalculation given Gould made nearly 88% of his field goals in six seasons with the 49ers and has never missed a kick in the playoffs.
3a. But guessing those fans in Cleveland took extra delight in watching Moody, who hails from the University of Michigan, misfire.
4. In an often unwatchable game, the 49ers and Browns combined for 25 penalties, which added up to 224 yards' worth of infractions.
5. Are the Eagles the NFL’s best team? Again, power rankings won’t be revealed until Tuesday morning, and Philadelphia’s first-ever loss to the New York Jets felt a touch fluky on a day when the reigning NFC champs turned the ball over four times against a defense that didn’t even have All-Pro CB Sauce Gardner (concussion), among several other injuries.
5a. Philly QB Jalen Hurts matched a career-high with three INTs.
6. It was the Jets’ first win over the Eagles after losing the first 12 matchups between the franchises.
7. Brothers Quinnen (INT) and Quincy Williams (fumble recovery) each took the ball away for the resilient NYJ D.
8. Are the Detroit Lions the NFL’s best team? We mentioned power rankings won’t be out until Tuesday? But they’re 5-1, too – their best record to start a season since 2011 – after thumping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20-6. Few teams have the balance on both sides of the ball that Detroit does.
9. Are the Miami Dolphins now the NFL’s best team? Another reminder that power rankings won’t be revealed until Tuesday morning … and it’s hard to foresee the Fins taking over the top spot two weeks after a four-touchdown loss at Buffalo. But maybe the question that needs to be asked is this: Are we witnessing the best offense in league history?
9a. Miami finished with 424 yards in Sunday’s win, amazingly nearly 100 shy of its league-best average entering Week 6. The Dolphins needed 8 more to join the 2000 “Greatest Show on Turf” St. Louis Rams as the only teams with 3,000 yards of offense through six games.
9b. Yet Miami became the first team during the Super Bowl era (since 1966) with both 15 rushing and receiving TDs after six games.
9c. With 163 receiving yards Sunday, Dolphins WR Tyreek Hill now has a league-best 814 – most ever through six games during the Super Bowl era.
9d. Hill has expressed his desire to become the first man with 2,000 receiving yards in one season. He’s currently on pace to finish with 2,306.
9e. And – seriously – let’s not discount Miami RB Raheem Mostert as a very dark horse for the league’s MVP award. He became the sixth player since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger with at least 11 touchdowns through six games. He’s been overshadowed to this point by injured rookie De'Von Achane but now has a real opportunity to distinguish himself. Mostert finished with 132 total yards and three TDs on Sunday.
9f. But it wasn't all bouquets for the Dolphins, who suffered the ignominy of punting on their opening drive for the first time this season ...
10. Miami routed the Carolina Panthers 42-21, meaning the NFL still has one winless outfit.
11. Rounding out the quintet of 5-1 teams? How about the reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs – and maybe they’re atop the power rankings … even if it feels like they’ve been doing a bit of sleepwalking early in the season? Or is it star gazing amid their All-Pro tight end’s new plus-one?
12. Every team in the AFC North has at least three wins, the only division that can make such a claim.
13. The New England Patriots scored their first touchdown in 12 quarters – the equivalent of three games, obviously – so minor sign of life offensively.
13a. But make no mistake, the Pats are dead in the water – now 1-5 for the first time under Bill Belichick, their head coach since 2000.
13b. Several ex-Pats had a hand in New England's demise, including QBs Jimmy Garoppolo and Brian Hoyer and WR Jakobi Meyers, who scored the Las Vegas Raiders’ only TD in a 21-17 triumph.
13c. Sunday’s loss left Belichick stuck on 299 regular-season victories ... and 0-3 against longtime New England offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, now HC of the Silver and Black.
14. The victory was the 500th all time in the regular season for the peripatetic Raiders.
15. If it seems like CBS' top announcing team, Jim Nantz and Tony Romo, were in the penalty box having to call the Patriots-Raiders game in Las Vegas ... well, pretty much. But they needed to be in that penalty box to get a feel for it. Sunday was their first opportunity to do a game at Sin City's Allegiant Stadium – and most likely their last, as well, before they'll definitely return to call Super Bowl 58 in February. Important reps for them in an otherwise unimportant game.
16. Indianapolis got mopped by the Jaguars 37-20 – meaning the Colts still haven’t won their annual trip to Jacksonville since 2014, when Andrew Luck was their quarterback.
16a. Colts QB2 Gardner Minshew II has now been on both sides of that equation, but surely didn’t enjoy the Indy side of it after the former Jag turned the ball over four times (3 INTs, fumble).
17. Talk about execution. First, the New York Giants couldn't execute near the Buffalo goal line at the end of the first half, situational mismanagement costing them at least a chip-shot field-goal attempt. Then, at the end of the game – and again on the Bills' doorstep – the refs effectively executed the season for Big Blue (now 1-5) by failing to call a (warranted) second consecutive pass interference infraction as Giants TE Darren Waller was clearly obstructed on the game's final play in the end zone.
18. Creamsicle – lovely as ever.
19. Houston Texans QB C.J. Stroud continues to make progress in what could be a spirited race for Offensive Rookie of the Year honors in 2023. Yes, Stroud threw his first NFL interception Sunday but, more important, he posted two more TD passes as his team survived the Saints 20-13. The Texans (3-3) are at least .500 through six games for the first time since 2019.
19a. Stroud’s first 191 passes without an interception are the longest pick-free stretch in league history to start a career.
20. The Minnesota Vikings have beaten the NFC North-rival Chicago Bears five straight times, winning Sunday’s "battle" of teams that began the day 1-4.
20a. The Vikes were helped by issuing Bears rookie QB2 Tyson Bagent his “welcome to the NFL” moment on his first drive after replacing injured starter Justin Fields. Undrafted out of Division II Shephard University, Bagent was strip-sacked by Josh Metellus, and Minnesota’s Jordan Hicks returned the fumble 42 yards for a touchdown. Decisive play in the Vikings’ 19-13 victory.
21. Frightening sight seeing another Bills player – RB Damien Harris on Sunday night – removed from the field in an ambulance. Far more heartening to see Harris give the thumbs-up sign on his way off and quickly regain movement in his extremities after absorbing a thundering hit.
22. A blocked extra point in London prevented Baltimore Ravens K Justin Tucker (6 field goals) from achieving a new career high for points in one game. Tucker had 18 of the victorious Ravens’ 24 points.
23. Opposing Tucker on Sunday, Tennessee Titans K Nick Folk tied the record of the Baltimore sniper with his 70th consecutive field goal inside 40 yards.
24. The age of Cincinnati Bengals WR Andrei Iosivas, whose birthday was Sunday. The rookie out of Princeton celebrated by scoring his first NFL touchdown, a 3-yard pass from QB Joe Burrow, in Cincy’s 17-13 squeaker past the Seattle Seahawks.
25. In relief of injured Titans starter Ryan Tannehill, Tennessee QB2 Malik Willis was sacked four times in nine dropbacks.
26. Chiefs DT Chris Jones has a sack in eight consecutive games – three shy of matching his own franchise record.
27. The Chiefs’ 16-game winning streak against the Denver Broncos is tied for the third longest in league history by one team over another. A win at Denver in Week 8 would allow K.C. to match the second-longest such run of domination.28. The Dolphins’ 20-game run over the Bills in the 1970s is the longest rule by one opponent over another.
29. Broncos QB Russell Wilson was sacked for the 500th time in his career in Thursday night’s loss. Only Aaron Rodgers (531) has been taken down more among active quarterbacks than Wilson (501), who has been a starter four fewer seasons than the four-time MVP.
30. Speaking of sacks, Washington Commanders QB Sam Howell has been dumped 34 times, putting him on pace to suffer a record 96 at that rate.
31. Yet Howell (3 TD passes) was on the winning side Sunday after Atlanta Falcons counterpart Desmond Ridder served up three second-half interceptions. It was the second time in three games Ridder had three turnovers, a showing sure to rekindle suggestions that Atlanta should insert ex-Commander Taylor Heinicke into the lineup.
31a. The defeat was the first Ridder experienced on his home field since he was in high school, a streak that encompassed 31 consecutive wins between the University of Cincinnati and Atlanta.
32. Congrats to Falcons DL Calais Campbell, who’s always kept it 100 during his estimable 16-year career. The 2019 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award winner collected his 100th career sack, the fifth player currently on an active roster to reach that threshold.

Buffalo Bills running back Damien Harris, who exited Sunday night’s 14-9 win over the New York Giants after a neck injury, was released from a Buffalo-area hospital on Monday, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported.
On Sunday night, Bills coach Sean McDermott said that Harris had full movement in his body and his early scans looked good.
Speaking after the Bills' 14-9 win against the New York Giants, McDermott also said that he was told Harris' scans are also good so far.
"So, things are heading in a good direction right now for Damien," McDermott said.
Harris was injured with a little more than three minutes remaining in the second quarter when he was tackled on a 1-yard run up the middle.  
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
Harris was tackled by Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke and other defenders on the third-and-1 play as they attempted to keep the running back from gaining a first down.
The officials ruled Harris had gained a first down, but he stayed on the turf.
Harris remained on the ground for a few minutes as concerned players from both teams looked on. Harris was eventually placed on a stretcher and loaded onto an ambulance.
The running back gave the crowd a thumbs up as he was placed on the stretcher. The Bills later announced that Harris suffered a neck injury and was transported to a local hospital.
"It's really an emotional thing, and people be trying to act like we're unhuman like ... that stuff is real," Bills left tackle Dion Dawkins said. "It's very real, and Damien's our brother. He's our friend, and we know him personally. To see him laying down … he just found out two days ago that he was having a boy. They said that it was a neck injury. Imagine if he can't hold his son off of one play? That's scary, man. It's scary. And I take it for what it is, and I take it with respect of God, but like any moment, it could be it."
Buffalo is all too familiar with frightening injuries.
Bills safety Damar Hamlin suffered cardiac arrest following a routine tackle on Jan. 2. game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
A visibly concerned Hamlin was shown on the broadcast as Buffalo’s medical staff tended to Harris.
Harris is in his first season with the Bills. The 26-year-old spent the previous four years of his career with the New England Patriots. New England selected Harris in the third round of the 2019 NFL draft out of Alabama.
Hi there OnPolitics readers! Last week, voters questioned five Republican presidential candidates in a series of town halls in Exeter, New Hampshire, hosted by Seacoastonline and the USA TODAY Network.
🎤 Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former Vice President Mike Pence and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy all spoke at the historic Exeter Town Hall, but it was clear Granite State voters weren’t going to let the candidates get away with simply delivering their stump speech.
Instead, voters made their priorities – and worries – clear, pressing 2024 White House hopefuls on their vision for the nation, USA TODAY’s Phillip M. Bailey reports:
⏰ Climate change, social security and concerns for the future: Those who showed up to speak with the candidates face-to-face wanted answers on how they would tackle America's long-term problems.
🐘 Compassionate conservatism: The candidates repeatedly emphasized how the voters who aren't paying attention yet want a solutions-oriented leader seeking common ground in 2024, not a bombastic style.
❌ Haley and Ramaswamy's contrasts pack the house: Haley and Ramaswamy's forums had standing room only attendance, which could indicate they're on a collision course in the Granite State.
🤝 Pence praised after the Capitol attack: Voters told Pence that they wanted to specifically thank him for refusing to cave amid pressure from former President Donald Trump and threats from supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
🎁 Voters are skeptical about moving on from Trump: Many voters who attended the forums this past week, said they fear former President Donald Trump has the primary wrapped up.

Republican presidential hopefuls came to New Hampshire last week and answered questions directly from voters in a series of town hall forums. Some of their responses checked out, but other claims were false or misleading.
Five candidates took part in the forums presented by USA TODAY, the USA TODAY Network and Seacoastonline at the Exeter Town Hall, where Donald Trump, Barack Obama and many other former presidents have campaigned.
Topics ranged from energy and the environment to taxes and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Here's where the candidates were on – and off – the mark:
“I’ve been to Kensington, in the inner city of Philadelphia. You know what happens there? The aid programs, including funded by the government, hand out crack pipes and needles as a form of aid.” 
This claim by Vivek Ramaswamy, a tech entrepreneur and political newcomer, is only half true.
Like many communities around the country, Philadelphia has a needle exchange program that provides clean needles for drug users to slow the spread of disease.
"Clean needles are an evidence-based intervention proven to save lives, included in the White House’s recommendations for addressing the overdose epidemic," Sarah Peterson, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Mayor's Office, told USA TODAY in an email.
More:A new 'fentanyl fighter' hits a market crowded with overdose reversal drugs
The city’s website notes the benefits of such programs in preventing the spread of infections including hepatitis C and HIV. But the website makes no mention of offering crack pipes – because there's no such program.
Peterson said the city distributes safe smoking kits, but those do not include pipes.
It echoes a similar claim that USA TODAY debunked in 2022, which asserted that President Joe Biden’s administration was spending $30 million on crack pipes as part of its program to reduce health risks tied to drug use. The program allowed for grantees to purchase safe smoking kits, but crack pipes were not among the approved materials. 
“25% fatherlessness rate in this country. Yes, we ought to have empathy for kids who grow up in those households, who are eight times more likely to end up in prison, 10 times more likely to end up in poverty, over 10 times less likely to graduate from high school and enter and get a college degree.” 
The fatherlessness statistic Ramaswamy cited matches 2022 data from the U.S. Census Bureau that found about a quarter of the 73 million children under 18 living without fathers in the home.
There's less clarity about exactly how much more likely other negative outcomes are as a result, though research shows the lack of a father figure increases the chances of other negative life outcomes.

The Census Bureau in 2020 found that children in fatherless households were four times more likely to be in poverty, well short of the 10 times cited by Ramaswamy.
Other studies we found used slightly different metrics, confirming a correlation but with different figures.
"We cut taxes more than any other administration in history."
This claim by former Vice President Mike Pence is false. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by then-President Donald Trump in December 2017. An analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget determined "it would definitely not be the largest in history," but would instead be the eighth-largest as a percent of gross domestic product since 1918 and the fourth-largest in inflation-adjusted dollars.
More:US government shutdowns used to be rare. That’s increasingly no longer the case.
The Washington Post found Trump's tax cut amounted to nearly 0.9% of GDP, which means Trump's tax cut was smaller than tax cuts passed under several previous administrations. For instance, the Economic Recovery Act of 1981 passed under President Ronald Reagan was 2.89% of GDP. By the same measurement, Trump's tax cut was also smaller than two tax cuts passed under his predecessor, President Barack Obama.
"The virus came from a Chinese lab."
Some polls show many Americans believe COVID-19 leaked from a lab, but Pence's assertion is still far from settled.
The White House said in February there was not a consensus across the government on the origins of the virus, as USA TODAY reported at the time. That announcement followed reports that the Energy Department had concluded the pandemic most likely was caused by an unintentional lab leak in China. However, the department's conclusion was made with “low confidence,” meaning the level of certainty was not high, according to the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.

Biden had previously asked intelligence agencies to investigate the origins of the virus, but they were not able to reach a consensus, according to The Washington Post, which noted that most of the agencies favored, with "low confidence," the "natural spillover" theory.
NPR reported in February that scientists who have studied the origins of the pandemic are far less divided, saying there is "very convincing" data and "overwhelming evidence" to indicate an animal origin.
“I'll always fight for transparency (in political spending), for you to see everything in government and otherwise. I did that in South Carolina, I did it at the U.N. I think you need to see everything that is possible to see and then you can make the best decision.”
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s response to a question about political spending fails to note that she has specifically fought against donor transparency for her own political nonprofit.
Haley was asked about how to counteract the influence of big money donors in politics, and she said donors to political action committees and candidates must be disclosed, and that identifying large financial backers can help voters recognize potential influences.

However, Haley founded a political nonprofit after leaving the Trump administration called Stand for America. As a 501(c)(4) organization, it has the option to keep donors’ names private. It did so, but Politico obtained an unredacted tax filing for the nonprofit from 2019 that identified dozens of donors who had not given to Haley’s PAC of the same name, where their donations would have been public.
Haley called the release a violation of tax law and threatened to sue the New York attorney general’s office because the released version of the filing had a marking indicating the office had been in possession of that copy. USA TODAY could not find any media reports saying the lawsuit had been filed.
Open Secrets reported that Haley’s nonprofit raised more than $25 million in the four-plus years between its founding and when she joined the presidential race. The nonprofit’s funds cannot be used for a campaign, but it is a way of staying connected to donors and funding policy promotion efforts between campaigns.
"Now in South Carolina, when someone leaves the fence, they have a job to go to the next day. We have the lowest recidivism rate in the country.”
The claim is statistically correct, and the rate improved during the Haley administration, according to media reports. South Carolina’s recidivism rate – defined as the percentage of prisoners released who return to state custody within three years – is a nation-leading 19%, according to a study by the Virginia Department of Corrections. Other studies with different definitions also place recidivism around 20%.

While governor, Haley introduced programs to prepare inmates for life after incarceration. Those changes included job training, help with housing and other support services, steps that continued after she left office. State officials credit that approach with keeping former inmates from reoffending.
“President Biden canceled the oil leases from the Alaskan slope. This is after leases have been made. I will immediately open those lands back up for leasing so we can produce oil and we can get the price down at the pump.”
This is not an accurate description of what Biden did. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson appears to be conflating a pair of actions taken by the Department of Interior on Sept. 6. The agency proposed a rule that would reduce the acreage available for drilling on Alaska’s North Slope while also canceling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
The changes on the slope would not cancel any existing leases but would close off 10.6 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska from being used for drilling for oil. The slope produced nearly 500,000 barrels of oil daily in 2022, about a quarter of its peak in 2008.

No private companies held the leases canceled in the Arctic refuge, an area of environmentally-sensitive federal land in Alaska, according to the Associated Press. Nine leases were awarded at a 2021 auction, but an energy company and a real estate company both canceled their leases in 2022, according to media reports. The remaining leases were all held by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a corporation owned by the state government. Alaska officials expressed interest in partnering with oil companies to develop and drill the land when it won the auctions, but that hasn't happened yet.
If Hutchinson meant to say opening up Arctic leases, their impact on gasoline prices is purely hypothetical. The Energy Information Administration said in a 2018 report that it could take 10 years after leases are issued before oil from the refuge would enter the market because more studies must be performed, and infrastructure must be built.
“Right now, I could not put in a work requirement, which I tried to do in Arkansas, that if you’re able-bodied and you don’t have small children at home, then you have to work or you have to be in worker training or you have to volunteer.”
This claim is largely accurate.
Thirteen states received waivers during the Trump administration to institute work requirements for at least some people in their Medicaid programs, although Arkansas was the only one to drop people from the program for non-compliance, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. The others either paused implementation or held off on enforcing the requirements because of threats of litigation or the COVID-19 pandemic.
More:Helpers few and far between for rural Americans kicked off Medicaid after pandemic
But the Biden administration revoked all waivers in 2021, pointing in part to a federal report that found work requirements in Arkansas – even before the pandemic – did not increase employment and caused about 18,000 Arkansans to lose coverage.
However, Georgia won a court fight last year to implement a work requirement as part of a Medicaid expansion effort, applying the requirement only to people who become eligible for Medicaid under expanded criteria. That program began on July 1 but was not a new waiver under Biden.

"The United States has taken more CO2 out of the air than any other country in the world."
This claim by North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is true in terms of absolute numbers, but there's more to the story.
The U.S. reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by about 760 million metric tons per year from 2000-14, according to a 2018 report from the bipartisan Environmental and Energy Study Institute – the most recent version available. The drop was about four times as large as the one in the United Kingdom, which ranked second with an annual cut of 170 million metric tons.
More:Visualizing climate change's wrath: Global warming's dire impact on Earth explored
But because the U.S. is also one of the world’s top carbon dioxide producers, that represents a relatively small percentage drop of 8%. The report says most countries had cuts of at least 10%. Denmark trimmed its emissions by 30%.
“We cut $1.7 billion out of our state budget in my first four months in office. … We know how to balance budgets.”
His figure is right, but he left out some important context by taking credit for it.
Those cuts early in Burgum's term came when lower oil and commodity prices led to drops in revenue, according to a report by InForum. The budget assembled by Burgum and state lawmakers in 2017 cut state general fund spending from $6 billion to $4.3 billion.

But Burgum may be taking too much credit for that balanced budget. The state constitution explicitly requires lawmakers and the governor to approve a balanced budget every two years.

EXETER, N.H. – Voters in New Hampshire and beyond agree on at least one thing: There sure are a lot of Republican candidates running against Donald Trump – and none of them seem to be catching up.
"It's interesting that so many have chosen to run against Trump," said New Hampshire Republican Party volunteer Jennifer LePla after hearing Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley address a candidate summit in Nashua.
LePla, 55, a Sandwich resident who is staying neutral in the presidential race, said she sees how candidates are working hard to try and be competitive with Trump.
"Clearly, it's going to be challenging," she said, but added that anything can happen in the historic "first-in-the-nation" primary.
"It's New Hampshire."
Less than 100 days from the Iowa caucuses that trigger the nomination process, non-Trump candidates are pursuing various campaign and media strategies designed to cut into Trump's massive poll lead in early contest states.
Their common goal: Get in the game with Trump.
“New Hampshire is so wide open,” DeSantis told reporters as the Florida governor filed Thursday to run in the New Hampshire primary expected to be held in January.
Voters said the challengers have no choice but to go straight at Trump, even at the risk of alienating many Trump voters. Yet they are also skeptical about whether they can succeed, even with Trump's many legal problems and abrasive campaign style.
"I don't know if there is anything they can do, which is extremely sad," said Tom Harvell, 52, of Exeter, a self-described independent voter who is middle-of-the-road.
Harvell, who saw former South Carolina governor Haley at a USA TODAY Network town hall in Exeter, said "so many people are entranced with (Trump) ... For the love of God, I can't figure out why."
In addition to DeSantis and Haley, the Republican candidates trying to figure it out include former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.
Among their efforts:
DeSantis, who had focused more on conservative media, is now appearing on more mainstream outlets – and seeking a comeback.
Once seen as the top Republican alternative to Trump - a candidate who was in a fairly strong second place in many polls – DeSantis has slid back to the rest of the pack amid a steady barrage of attacks from the former president and his allies.
In his new campaign phase, DeSantis is also amplifying his record in Florida and policy differences with Trump that include border security and federal spending.
He's also spending more time on Trump's indictments and other legal problems, saying they will turn off voters who would otherwise vote Republican because of President Joe Biden's record.
"A referendum on Joe Biden means we win if I'm the candidate," DeSantis said recently on MSNBC's “Morning Joe.” "I think a referendum on Donald Trump, if that's it, then I think the Democrats would win."
The former United Nations ambassador has seen upticks in fundraising and polls since attention-getting appearances in the first two Republican presidential debates.
A recent Suffolk University/Boston Globe/USA TODAY poll put Haley in second place in New Hampshire, ahead of DeSantis.
Like other competitors, Haley is also trying to establish herself as the consensus alternative to Trump. Allies are suggesting that GOP donors and candidates consolidate behind her as the best bet against Trump.
That subtle strategy paid off this week when former Rep. Will Hurd, R-Tex., dropped out of the race and endorsed Haley.
During her USA TODAY Network town hall, Haley continued to promote herself as a "new generation" of leadership, in contrast to the last Republican president.
"I think Donald Trump was the right president at the right time," Haley said. "I don’t think he’s the right president now.”
Pence is increasingly critical of the president who put him on the national ticket, hitting him over support for tariffs, increased isolation in the world, criticism of Israel and a populist style at odds with traditional conservatism.
"I'm the most qualified, most experienced and most tested conservative seeking the Republican nomination," Pence said during his USA TODAY Network town hall.
Pence probably has more at stake in Iowa, which has a high number of social conservatives that are a big part of his base.
The former New Jersey governor has been the race's fiercest critic of Trump and probably will continue to be, especially over the four criminal trials he faces.
"If he were a convicted felon, would you support him for president of the United States," Christie said during the "First In The Nation Leadership Summit" of the New Hampshire Republican Party.
Christie also figures to continue focusing on New Hampshire, as opposed to Iowa.
He is hoping to replicate what John McCain did in 2008: A long-shot candidate whose victory in New Hampshire propelled him through the primary process onto the nomination.
The businessman, author, and first-time candidate has always cast himself as the outsider candidate who is taking on "the establishment," an aggressive approach that has drawn verbal fire from other candidates.
Don't expect Ramaswamy to stop any time soon.
"I do think it will take an outsider to that system coming in to break that system," Ramaswamy said during a USA TODAY Network town hall.
The South Carolina senator is being more aggressive, both toward Biden and toward other Republicans, particularly since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war.
Witness his dust-up with Haley during the Sept. 27 debate in California.
Citing comments from DeSantis and Ramaswamy, Scott said, "the last thing we need is a Joe Biden wing of the Republican Party on foreign policy,” he added.
The longshot North Dakota governor is trying to make sure he can still qualify for the Republican presidential debates, an endeavor that requires higher poll numbers and more donors.
The next Republican debate is scheduled for Nov. 8 in Miami.
To that end, Burgum has revived a publicity-seeking idea from earlier in the campaign: Gift cards. The campaign is offering $20 gift cards to people who contribute as little as $1 to his campaign.
During a USA TODAY Network town hall, Burgum said of his campaign that "there's three things we're going to focus on − the economy, energy and national security."
During his USA TODAY Network town hall, a visitor asked Hutchinson about the crowded field against Trump: How do you get attention with so many other rivals?
The former Arkansas governor said it takes hard work, talking to voters every day of every week right up to the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
Like Christie, Hutchinson has been notably critical of Trump.
Trump supporters say it doesn't matter what the other candidates do: The former president is going to win in New Hampshire and cruise to the Republican nomination.
"We have the biggest grassroots operation in the state," said Stephen Stepanek, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign in New Hampshire.
He also said there's nothing the other candidates can do about it: "Probably the best thing they can do is endorse Trump and give up."
Voters who don't care for Trump said it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of the candidates to drop out.
Right now, they said, too many candidates are splitting the anti-Trump vote; a few GOP candidates should consider pulling a Will Hurd and get behind a single alternative.
"Narrowing it down would help," said Christy DeSisto, 57, a Massachusetts resident who crossed state lines to attend a USA TODAY Network town hall featuring Pence.
CONCORD, N.H. — New Hampshire Democrats aren’t happy with their party over a move to strip the state of its first-in-the-nation primary status, but they’re not necessarily looking for a new one.  
With the incumbent Democratic President Joe Biden unlikely to compete in the state’s contest amid the dispute, several national organizations urged Democratic voters in New Hampshire to drop their party affiliation before an October deadline so that they could vote in the state’s Republican primary early next year.  
Both the Tell It Like It Is PAC, a group supporting former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and the nonprofit organization American Leadership Today mailed flyers to registered Democrats encouraging them to change parties prior to the state’s Oct. 6 deadline in hopes of preventing former President Donald Trump from winning the election, Politico reported. 
Some flyers displayed scenes of rioters outside of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 , exclaiming in bold type, “This can’t happen again,” while others showed photos of Trump and impressed on recipients the importance of their votes, stating that it’s up to New Hampshire “to save our democracy.” 
A small group of Democrats, who are based in Washington, D.C., say they canvassed in New Hampshire, too, and texted registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters in the state. The volunteer organization with minimal funds that popped up over the summer, PrimaryPivot, says it texted 38,000 registered Democrats in New Hampshire before the deadline. 
But few Democrats appear to have made the switch — only about 4% changed their party affiliation since August, according to data provided by the New Hampshire’s Secretary of State’s office.  
“We saw no significant movement. We were monitoring in a few key locations, and we didn't see anything of any significance,” New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley said in an interview. 
That could be good news for Trump, who maintained an over 20-point lead in the latest USA TODAY/Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll in New Hampshire. His next nearest rival Nikki Haley polled at 19%, followed by Ron DeSantis at 10%. Christie was at 6%. 
The small drift of Democrats may not impact the results of the primary. The percentage of voters in each party held at roughly 30%, with 40% registered undeclared.  
Overall, the state says it has 879,512 voters, including 265,113 registered Democrats, 269,779 Republicans and 344,620 undeclared voters. The total number of registered voters in New Hampshire has shrunk since the beginning of August by about 17,000. 
But residents of New Hampshire who are not currently registered to vote can still sign up. New Hampshire residents can register to vote and cast a ballot at their polling place in January on the day of the expected primary. 
Many Democratic voters who spoke to USA TODAY said they hadn’t heard of initiatives encouraging Democratic voters to switch affiliations, though some considered it. 
Charlotte Wallace, a lifelong Democrat who moved to Durham, New Hampshire in 2020, chose to drop her Democratic Party affiliation so she could vote in the Republican primary, citing concerns about Biden’s age. She hasn’t decided who she’ll cast her ballot for yet, but said she’s considering Christie, former Vice President Mike Pence and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. 
“I am very grateful to Christie for standing up to Trump in the debates. I am grateful to Pence for standing up to Trump when it really mattered and saving our democracy, and I would love to see a woman president,” Wallace said.  
Elliott Kane, a resident of Exeter, New Hampshire, similarly considered becoming an undeclared voter for the primary but said it ultimately “felt like cheating.”  
“I'm not a Republican, and it feels sort of like a moral betrayal to identify as one for even a split second,” Kane said, noting that he would have cast his ballot for Christie on the Republican side.  
Originally from New Jersey, Kane, who is transgender, said that while he didn’t support Christie as governor and didn’t have “a lot of generous feelings” for the candidate, he believes Christie is the “most level-headed" in the Republican field.  
“He actually had some trans neutral comments … which made me have some respect for him, which is weird, because I'm from New Jersey,” Kane said.  
PrimaryPivot says it is looking to set up a ground operation in New Hampshire ahead of the primary in an effort to convince more unaffiliated voters to cast a ballot against Trump.  
The organization released a flyer on Friday promoting an Oct. 28 event for undeclared voters at New England College in Henniker that it said former New Hampshire attorney general Tom Rath, the campaign manager for Biden challenger Marianne Williamson and an unnamed Christie campaign surrogate would be participating in. 
“If Trump underperforms in New Hampshire, and then he underperformed in a number of states on Super Tuesday, then you would have very much talk of a competitive primary,” said Robert Schwartz, a foreign affairs professional who is spearheading the effort with a few of his friends. 
Democrats who do opt to vote in their party’s primary are unlikely to see Biden on the ballot. Last year, the president recommended a change to the Democratic primary calendar that ripped New Hampshire of its first-in-the-nation status, pushing the state’s primary to Feb. 6, on the same day as Nevada and three days after South Carolina.  
State law requires New Hampshire to hold the country’s first primary, and its GOP-run legislature refused to change the statute to accommodate the Democratic National Committee effort.
The state still has not set a date for the primary, though Secretary of State David Scanlan has indicated that it will take place at the end of January.  
Current and former Democratic officials in the state are exploring a write-in campaign to keep Biden from losing the first contest of his reelection campaign, and the state party chair, Buckley, poured cold water on the effectiveness of the party-switching campaigns. 
“I think for those 200, maybe, people, that do that, you know, good luck to them. They got punked,” he said. “But I don't see it of any significance at all.” 
“What is this treasure of a mountain going to become?”
That’s the question everyone's asking concerning the 374-acre property in Colorado that operated as a ski resort from the 1930s to the 1980s. 
Formerly called St. Mary’s Glacier Ski Resort, the property was listed for sale on Sept. 19 and currently has an asking price of $7 million.
Part of Clear Creek County, the property is about 45 miles northwest of Denver and borders the Arapaho National Forest.
The listing also includes a parking lot poised to bring its buyer lots of revenue, said Kristin Michas, broker associate from LIV Sotheby’s International Realty.
She is handling the listing along with broker associate Josh Jackson and one other realtor. 
When asked about its size, Michas said it’s not as big as Vail Ski Resort about 75 miles away but has a lot to offer.
“It's a very iconic site,” she said. “It's beautiful. It's amazing and surrounded by forest. It's 374 acres but it goes on forever and ever after that (due to the) forests surrounding it.”
The associates are getting 6 to 12 requests per week regarding the former ski resort, including inquiries from large and small developers, entrepreneurs, hospitality companies and private equity firms.

A couple that owned the property previously used it to run an affordable and accessible ski resort. It lasted until the 1980s, Michas shared. 
“They sat down and just didn't have the revenue to support the operation so our clients purchased the property sometime after that with the vision of reopening a snowboarding resort or practice ski mountain kind of thing,” Michas said.
The new owners weren’t able to successfully do so and now, they want to sell it.
“It seems like it would be a great opportunity for somebody else,” Michas shared.
Jackson, another broker associate handling the sale, said the property is a former ski resort, yes, but the possibilities are endless.
Jackson said the former resort is in Clear Creek County, an area where people have spent the last decade trying to make the county “not just a flyover state.’”
“The county itself is trying to carve out its own identity as a bonafide adventure tourism location,” he shared.
Wisconsin:'What in the Flintstones go to Jurassic Park' is this Zillow Gone Wild featured home?
Jackson, who is working with Michas to sell the property, said the team isn’t selling a ski resort. There’s so much more to it and what it could be.
“We’re selling … acres of pristine mountaintop at between 10,000 feet and about almost 12,000 feet that could be a ski resort,” he said. “It could be an adventure hospitality type of business. It could be a residential development. It could be a whole bunch of different things.”
He called it a unique business opportunity for whoever buys it, adding that the property allows people to access hundreds of miles of trails, glaciated lakes, mountain peaks and untouched wilderness.
And whoever buys the property will be bound to make some money due to the attached parking lot and the property’s location. St. Mary’s Glacier has snow on it year-round and is one of the most popular hikes in Colorado, he shared.
“It has a very intense following,” Jackson told USA TODAY. “We're talking to hundreds, if not in some weeks, thousands of people come up every week to park in the parking lot that we've included in our offering.”
Michas said the property is an “entrepreneurial dream” and it’ll be fun to see what the buyers do with it.
“It just has a lot of history and I think it's fun, seeing the interest that people have,” she said. “It's kind of fun to see these dreamers and people really trying to paint a picture of, in their minds, what it will be.”
The IRS extended the tax-filing and payment deadline to Nov. 16 for most California taxpayers due to the winter storms earlier this year.
The agency announced the extension on Monday, which was the previous deadline.
Residents living in the 55 qualifying counties including San Francisco, San Bernardino, Los Angeles and San Diego can qualify for IRS relief, the agency said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency offers reliefs based on three different disaster declarations including severe winter storms, flooding, mudslides and mudslides over a period of several months.
The IRS first extended the federal deadline in January and in March announced California would have their own extension.
It's time to do your taxes:No, really. Unless you live in California, the final 2022 tax year deadline is Oct. 16.
Nearly all 58 California counties are eligible for the tax deadline extension with the exception of Lassen, Modoc and Shasta counties, according to the IRS.
Residents automatically have their tax deadline pushed to Nov. 16 as long as their address of record shows they live in one of the 55 qualifying California counties, the IRS said.
These residents do not need to provide documentation showing they were impacted by the storms.

According to the IRS, the following returns and payments are eligible:
The agency said taxpayers can visit the  IRS disaster relief page for information on other qualifying returns, payments and time-sensitive tax-related actions.
The IRS previously postponed the deadline in much of California due to extreme weather, as well as parts of Alabama and Georgia.
California endured severe winter weather in early March leading to Gov. Gavin Newsom declaring a state of emergency in 13 counties including Amador, Kern, LA, Madera, Mariposa, Mono, Nevada, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Sierra, Sonoma and Tulare.
Unusual snowfall and strong winds across the state left some cars are completely buried, snow piled up on roofs and even momentarily trapped residents in their homes in the mountains east of L.A.

When Mike McElhattan of Illinois-based DeLorean Midwest got a call from New Mexico about a DeLorean car for sale, he wasn’t interested.
At least not until he found out the car had only 977 miles on the odometer.
DeLorean Midwest specializes in repair, sales and parts distribution for these cult classic cars featured in the "Back to the Future" movie franchise.
He and his business partner Kevin Thomas met with the 90-year-old owner, Dick, in early October, and the trio found the car sunken like buried treasure into the dirt floor of a barn.
The men perused the vehicle, which was covered in about two decades of dust and filled with rodent droppings. In a first for McElhattan ― who has seen thousands of DeLoreans in his 16 years working in the business ― there were live mice running around inside the car.
Check car recalls here:Ford and Mercedes-Benz among nearly 250,000 vehicles recalled
Despite the smell and the resident rodents, these DeLorean fans were smiling.
The car, manufactured in April 1981, appeared to be mostly if not completely original ― even down to a blue oil filter McElhattan thinks could be from the factory. The factory tires were flat, but had plenty of tread left.
“It’s an absolute time capsule,” McElhattan said. “To me, what’s cool about it, is it’s completely original down to the original tires that rolled out of the factory in Belfast, Ireland.”
Dick (whose last name wasn't shared by McElhattan) was the original registered owner after Hall Chevrolet in Milwaukee owned the vehicle from 1981 to 1991, according to McElhattan.

DeLorean Midwest will likely need to gut the interior to thoroughly clean out the rodent remains. It will need a good bit of mechanical work, too. McElhattan said it typically takes around six months to get a car like this ready for sale.
“It’s very rewarding to take a filthy car like this and really transform it,” he said. “People just want to see it brought back to its full glory.”
McElhattan said someone interested in purchasing a DeLorean today can usually find one between $65,000 and $85,000 depending on its mechanical history and mileage. However, some can sell for much higher.
“I’ve sold cars well into the six figures when there’s something special like this,” McElhattan said.
Amazingly, this isn’t the lowest mileage DeLorean McElhattan has seen ― that was a car with only 14 miles.

It usually costs between $1,000 and $1,500 per year to maintain the car.
“They have a vintage feel to them, but they kind of drive like a modern car,” McElhattan said.
DeLoreans were only available for three model years: 1981 through 1983. Despite this, parts are readily available as the company warehouse in the ‘80s had a lot of stock on hand when production ceased.
“You can still buy about 70% of the car as new old stock,” McElhattan said, adding because of the surplus the parts are relatively affordable.
While "Back to the Future" propelled the DeLorean into its pop culture status decades ago, McElhattan said interest in the cars continues to grow. For him, it was the gullwing doors and stainless steel exterior that attracted his attention as the design was “really ahead of its time.”
“It really makes for a unique car,” he said. “If you could pick one car to sum up the 1980s, the DeLorean is the quintessential car.”

Consumers who purchased certain trash bags over the past five years may be eligible for a share of a class action settlement.
Reynolds Consumer Products settled an Illinois lawsuit against it that alleged that the company mislead consumers by promoting certain Hefty and Great Value trash bags as recyclable when they were not.
The company did not admit fault in the settlement but agreed to pay up to $3 million and either recreate the bags to be recyclable or remove the claim from the product's packaging within six months.
The settlement has been preliminarily approved with a hearing on final approval set for November 15.

Similar to how it is within the single digits, nine represents endings in numerology. A new cycle of life may be on its way if you're seeing 999 in your daily life. 
These repeating number sequences, known as angel numbers, are used as guides for deeper spiritual exploration. From zero to nine, each numeral has its own significance. 
In a conversation with Elizabeth Summers, esoteric numerologer, USA TODAY dives deeper into the number nine and its angel number meaning, including how it can impact your relationships and careers. 
What are angel numbers?Beginner's guide to angel numbers and what they (could) mean.
The angel number 999 is associated with completion. In this sense, seeing 999 means things in your current situation are coming to an end in order for new opportunities to present themselves.

"I always use the phrase 'God's closing doors, but opening windows,' and that is the number nine," said Summers. 
Jobs may come to an end, relationships and friends may fizzle out but this all happens to bring on bigger and better possibilities. There is also a creative and entertaining energy with the number nine, said Summers.
This angel number signals to trust the process of how your life is shaping out, what is meant to be will be, and don't get caught up in the drama.

If you're seeing 999, old loves from this lifetime or another may make reappearances. While you may pick up where you left off and it feels passionate, the romance is ill-fated. "It does not last because it's the completion," said Summers. 
Passion is a buzzword for this angel number and as a result, relationships can become very dramatic. Try to remain emotionally neutral and detached, said Summers. 
Be patient with yourself and life. Maybe that person is not the love of your life after all, and someone new and exciting is coming your way. 
"You have to stay calm, relax and allow (the guides) to finish it up for you to work through," said Summers.

Similarly, within your career, the angel number 999 is about accepting the outcome, whatever it may be, said Summers.
Maybe you decide to take a new job, meaning you have to rearrange your daily routine. Or you are made to transfer offices, meaning you have to meet a new set of coworkers and say goodbye to your old ones. 
It may seem like a rocky transition, but this old cycle has come to an end for a reason. 
"Take your time as you move into it," said Summers. "It's kind of a wiggle wobble in the ending."

The angel number 999 is associated with the hermit card in tarot, which also relates to completeness. This card represents the understanding and development of personal consciousness and calls to search for the next goal on your spiritual journey. 
The number nine is about experiences and allowing them to lead you your highest good and greatest joy. 
While it may be hard to trust the path at hand, 999 reminds us to be compassionate and open-hearted to all possibilities.  
"Just go with the flow," said Summers.

Even though things may not be going how you want them to or planned them to, do not resist or rebel, said Summers. Stubbornness can come about with the appearance of 999. 
It is key to practice non-resistance, having faith in the nine energy. "Easy way or hard way, what's going to end is going to end whether you like it or not," said Summers. 
It may be time to consider how you acted, what you gained or what didn't serve you in the past. Take each situation on your journey as a learning experience, as 999 teaches us to reflect and mature. 
"Once we have that humility and trust and faith, life only gets better," said Summers.

Before any number, there is zero. As a result, in numerology, zero is often associated with potential and possibilities, and all that comes before the changes. If zeros keep popping up in your life anywhere from receipts to invoices, these appearances may be signaling new opportunities and possibilities.
These repeating number sequences, known as angel numbers, are used as guides for deeper spiritual exploration. From zero to nine, each numeral has its own significance. 
In a conversation with professional numerologist Novalee Wilder, USA TODAY dives deeper into the number zero and its angel number meaning, including how it can impact your relationships and careers.

"Usually, I see zeros as a pause," said Wilder. "Maybe you're percolating an idea in your head like something is simmering. You're gathering supplies or gathering energy. Seeing a lot of zero is just potential." 
Maybe you're seeing more job listings on LinkedIn, giving you the push to apply. Or considering saying "yes" to a friend who won't stop talking about setting you up on a blind date. 
Zero often makes appearances prior to the upcoming shifts, rather than signifying they are already underway.
"It's before anything else is happening, zero shows up," said Wilder. "It's like the seed of life." 
The angel number can also mean to slow down and consider your choices before making any decisions. It emphasizes working things out for a better timeline and weighing your options.

What does 222 mean?Angel number meaning and symbolism in your life, love and career.
Since 000 is heavily associated with possibility and the unknown, it's important to remember not to fall in love with someone's potential in relationships. 
Be sure to assess all sides of forthcoming opportunities, especially when it comes to relationships. Think of it like trying on new clothes, said Wilder. Ask yourself questions about what you want out of this new relationship. List your values, wants and needs.
"Does he like me, or will they pick me?" said Wilder. "Instead, sometimes the question is, 'Do I like him?'"
The repeating appearance of 000 reminds us to take whatever view you have and flip it. While your mind may be seeing the potential one way, the universe may be presenting it in another.

'Phoenix energy':444 angel number meaning and its role in your life
Much like in relationships, 000 reminds you to weigh your options in the workplace. When applying to a new job, remember to adjust your mindset. Think back to the list of things you want to know about this opportunity. 
"Instead of thinking, 'I really got to impress them,' remember to make your little list of things to ask about," said Wilder. "Why is this position available? What happened to the last person who had this position? How long do people usually stay?" These are good questions to ask.
By doing this, it will help you assess whether this role is worth it. The angel number 000 allows you to see a situation for what it is worth and the possibilities that come with it, but it also recognizes the value of something as it is, not what it can be.

What does 777 mean?This is one angel number that means it might be time to slow down.
The endless potential of 000 is a major positive to encountering the angel number, said Wilder. 
Just as the universe is infinitely creative, so are the possibilities in your life. If you are seeing a lot of 000 in your life, the universe if presenting that something better is on its way. 
If one door closes, another one will surely open, and that is what 000 reminds us. 
"It doesn't really matter if not this thing, then something else," said Wilder. "If whatever big thing you're working on is not working out, then there must be a better timeline." 
What is your zodiac sign?Horoscopes, astrology, and what the stars says about you
While open creativity is wonderful, there's also a downside. There may be great options coming your way, but there may also be not so great ones. 
Don't put your eggs in one basket, said Wilder. When one opportunity presents itself, do not jump to take it just because it seems the best at the time; a greater one could be coming, you just have to wait. 
Additionally, all these signs could be pointing that something is on its way but it never seems to pan out. While zero is infinite, it is also empty, said Wilder. Without contemplating or considering the situation at hand, you may jump in too early.
Take the time to find your incentive to push you along the journey that the angel number 000 is signaling. "It needs something else to join it," Wilder said.

In your life, are things seemingly moving so fast-paced that you don't even have a chance to think? While this is happening, is the number seven making repetitive and frequent appearances on everything from invoices, receipts to timers? 
These repeating number sequences, or angel numbers, can be used as guides for deeper spiritual exploration as each numeral has its own significance. 
In a conversation Elizabeth Summers, esoteric numerologer, USA TODAY breaks down the number seven, its angel number meaning and how it may affect your relationships and career.
What are angel numbers?Beginner's guide to angel numbers and what they (could) mean.
The angel number 777 is connected to the individual self, said Summers. Unlike others which are more focused on relationships, such as 222, the angel number 777 is about taking time to focus on yourself and to be alone. 
Is it in the stars? Free Daily and Monthly Horoscopes
It's about tuning out the noise and figuring out where you're headed.. This angel number calls you to sit with your actions and ponder things yet to come. 
"The number seven is a thinking vibration," said Summers. "There's also spiritual vibration, and it is a loner vibration." 
If you're seeing a lot of repeating sevens, it may be time to slow down and be still. This can be hard for some people, especially those who are action-driven, said Summers. However, the angel number 777 has an energy of inner peace and clarity. 
"It's all has to do with a slow-down period," she said.
The more you can be alone with your thoughts, the more you may realize you need less in your life, whether it be in your career or even relationships.
The number seven is also associated with the tower card in tarot, which signals to assess who you are and what you should do with the situations at hand.

What does 111 mean?Why you keep seeing it and how it will help you manifest your power.
The angel number 777 is not the best when it comes to relationships, said Summers, especially since it is gives off a solitary energy.
The appearance of this angel number can signify to make choices within your relationships. Be selective with who you listen to and who is in your life. 
When it comes to 777, it is more about self-improvement, making sure you can find your own identity and worth outside of relationships. Once you have a good sense of self, you can deal with partnerships, said Summers. 
What does 222 mean?Angel number meaning and symbolism in your life, love and career.
The quietness of the angel number 777 translates to career. It's about working alone in your own space outside of the hustle and bustle of the office. 
This angel number gives off an analytical and detail-oriented energy when it comes to work. 
Writing is also associated with angel number 777, said Summers. So, it may be time to sit and jot down that new pitch for work or start drafting the novel you always said you wanted to write.

Peace of mind and contentment are two positives associated with the angel number 777, said Summers. It also has an intuitive energy. 
The number is associated with spirituality, more related to getting in touch with your inner self; to raise your own consciousness about what you want and need on your journey.
Seven is related to evolution, growing and changing to reach your full potential.

On the flip side, with the presence of angel number 777, it is easy to want to isolate yourself.
"It is not the best number for relationships," said Summers. "If (the number 7 is) the person's personality, they'll spend most of their lifetime alone." 
While it is good to have alone time, it's also important to not burn bridges or remove yourself completely from others.

Panic mode activated – you’re sending an important folder of pictures via email but the files are too large to send. Or maybe it’s your computer storage that’s the issue, but you just can’t seem to get rid of sentimental old files. 
Zip files to the rescue! The “compress” function on your computer's operating system helps save space and can transfer files to other computers more efficiently. You can even password-protect your zip files using a file encryption system to secure them further.
Here’s your guide to creating and working with zip files on both Mac and PC. 
Creating the archive file is simple. Here’s how you can make a zip file from a single folder or from several individual files, according to Microsoft:
Organize your data:How to freeze a row or column in an Excel spreadsheet
Here’s how to make a zip file on a Mac, according to Apple:
This will create a separate file of the original item with a .zip extension. If you’re compressing a folder, it’ll retain the name of the original file with .zip at the end. If you’re compressing multiple files, it’ll create a file called “Archive.zip.”
To unzip a single item in the folder, drag it out of the zipped folder to a different location. If you’re looking to unzip the contents of the folder, right-click and select “Extract All.” From here, you’ll have to confirm the folder you want the files extracted from.
To unzip a compressed item on a Mac, just double-click on the zip file. According to Apple, you can only open a zip file if you have enough space on your Mac for the item.

Great news, America. Criminal defendant and leading GOP presidential primary candidate Donald Trump has something new to whine about – a partial gag order placed on him by the federal judge in his election interference case.
If you thought Trump’s yearslong journey to become the sorest of sore losers by ceaselessly braying about the 2020 presidential election he lost was growing tiresome, just you wait. Monday’s order provides fresh fodder for his persecution cannon, which I’m sure will be red hot from firing as the former president processes the fact that he, like anyone facing criminal charges, can’t freely intimidate witnesses, prosecutors or court personnel.
In issuing the order, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said: “Mr. Trump can certainly claim he’s being unfairly prosecuted, but I cannot imagine any other case where a defendant is allowed to call the prosecution ‘deranged,’ a ‘thug’ or anything else.”
She added: “His political campaign does not give him carte blanche to vilify public servants for simply doing their job.”
Setting aside the remarkable fact that a federal judge sees credible concerns that the far-and-away front-runner for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination is attempting to intimidate witnesses and prosecutors in his own criminal case, consider the way we’d expect Trump to respond to Chutkan’s decision.
Something along the lines of: “A CRAZY RADICAL LEFTIST MARXIST TRUMP-HATING ‘JUDGE’ has now totally violated my CONSTITUTIONAL rights by issuing a ‘gag order’ on me in what everyone knows is ELECTION INTERFERENCE led by Crazy Joe Biden and his boss, Barack HUSSEIN Obama. FIGHT BACK!”
I made that all up, but would you be surprised if Trump wrote something similar? And if you wouldn't be surprised, doesn't that suggest we're facing a serious problem?
Immediately after the ruling, Trump posted on Truth Social: "A TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED TO DEMOCRACY TODAY – GAG ORDER!" and "WILL APPEAL THE GAG ORDER RULING. WITCH HUNT!"
There's little doubt the angry rants will get worse.
Be honest Republican voters.Is Trump really what you want?
Prior to the gag order, Trump had labeled special counsel Jack Smith “a crackhead” and called him “psycho.”
In August, Trump posted what prosecutors viewed as a threat against witnesses, writing: “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU!”
And in a Sept. 22 post on Truth Social, Trump accused retired Gen. Mark Milley, a former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and now a witness in the election interference case, of treason and suggested that he should be executed.
Prosecutors, in their filing requesting a gag order, wrote that “no other criminal defendant would be permitted to issue public statements insinuating that a known witness in his case should be executed; this defendant should not be, either.”
Judge muzzles Trump:McCarthy booted from House speaker, Trump gagged. The Republican Party is an unserious mess.
Trump will squeal desperately and claim his free-speech rights are being trampled, but even a low-functioning mollusk would know that’s nonsense.
Trump was president, true. He isn’t anymore.
Trump is running for president, true. But that doesn’t give him the freedom to say whatever the hell he wants about people involved in the multiple criminal cases in which he faces 91 state and federal felony charges.
I’m not above the law, you’re not above the law and Trump, sad as it may be for him to learn, is not above the law.
But at least now he has some new material to work with. When your very essence is defined by aggrievement, a legal setback provides fresh paint for your victimhood self-portrait.
Let’s see how long it takes the whiner in chief to violate the judge’s gag order. I’m guessing it comes in 3, 2, 1 …

The violence in the Middle East has come to the American Midwest in the most gruesome fashion.
On Sunday, in a Chicago suburb, Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old American Muslim child of Palestinian descent, was fatally stabbed 26 times by his 71-year old landlord in what police allege is a hate crime. Wadea’s mother, stabbed multiple times as well, is still in serious condition in the hospital.
I cannot get the picture that has been circulating of young Wadea wearing his "Happy Birthday" hat out of my mind. It reminds me so much of my two boys when they were his age.
I fear that this is not going to be the only incident of the Israel-Hamas war having violent reverberations in the United States.
The principal of my son’s high school, a large and diverse institution on the north side of Chicago, sent out a message to all families saying she was concerned about violence in the school as a result of the war that began Oct. 7. At Columbia University in New York, a 24-year-old Israeli student was beaten while hanging flyers condemning the Hamas attack.
Who is going to hold America together? Because it sure feels like we are coming apart.
For years now we have been dangerously divided over controversial issues such as abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Now the conflict in the Middle East is creating new tensions in the United States.
Calling all athletic coaches, hospital nurses, elementary school teachers, high school principals, volunteer managers, small business owners and theater directors. America is relying on you.
If you have a diverse school or team or staff, they very likely disagree on some fundamental things, such as the conflict in the Middle East. Without minimizing the importance of their varying loyalties, your role as a leader is to focus their attention on working together on the task at hand, whether that is preparing food at a restaurant or fighting fires together in your community or playing hockey together on a team. 
We survived the Hamas attack.But now the blockade on Gaza haunts our interfaith group.
If you need some inspiration on the path of holding America together: Watch "Remember The Titans" starring Denzel Washington.
The movie, released in 2000, takes place in 1971, after T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, was fully integrated. The prior year, a Black teenager was killed by a white store clerk over the alleged theft of razor blades, touching off days of race riots. Tensions were high, and racial injustice ran deep. 
Then Black and white high school football players boarded buses to preseason training camp, led by newly appointed Black head coach Herman Boone.
Boone enjoyed telling people that he was not Martin Luther King Jr., Jesus Christ or the Easter Bunny – he was just a football coach. His job was not to affect the broader racial tensions in the society; it was simply to coach a winning football team. But to have a winning football team, he needed to make sure that the racial tensions in the society didn’t affect his players.
He paired Black and white athletes together as roommates and required them to learn some facts about one another. Mostly, he relied on the game of football to teach his players that they needed to work together. The white offensive linemen better block for the Black quarterback, or he’s not going to have time to throw a pass. The white receiver better catch the pass from that Black quarterback, or the team is not going to score touchdowns.
The movie is cheesy in parts, but it carries a powerful message: Our society’s strength is in the institutions that bring people of diverse identities and divergent ideologies together to cooperate on concrete activities with common aims.
And it is in the leaders who focus people on the areas of cooperation, even amid our wider conflicts.
So who is going to hold America together? The answer is: you.
You don’t just have an inspiring Denzel Washington movie on your side; there is academic research supporting this approach. In the social psychology study called the "Robbers Cave Experiment," researchers found that the best way to dissipate conflict between rival groups was to give them concrete activities on which to cooperate.
They also found that the longer diverse people cooperated, the more their identities shifted: from adversaries to friends.
Overwhelmed by the war in Israel?Here's how to protect your mental health.
And that new identities for some can have wider implications for all. In "Remember The Titans," as the integrated football team wins games, the broader Alexandria community finds its own racial tensions easing. Black and white families start sitting together in the stands, forming friendships, building a collective identity as Alexandria – not just Black Alexandria and white Alexandria.
It is a picture of America at its best.
We can appreciate this, because we know how ugly the alternative is. 
In the most powerful scene in the film, coach Boone takes his team on a grueling early morning run. They arrive at the destination just as the sun is coming up and are shocked to be looking at gravestones. It is Gettysburg, the battlefield turned cemetery where tens of thousands of Americans died in one of the most famous battles of the Civil War.
Coach Boone tells his team, “Take a lesson from the dead. If we don’t come together right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed.”  
Of course, it was on that same site that President Abraham Lincoln gave the Gettysburg Address, which ended with the famous lines: “This nation, under God, will have a new birth of freedom – and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.” 
The American people hail from every race, religion and nation on this earth. To achieve the goal that President Lincoln placed before us, we need to follow the path of coach Boone and realize that we need to cooperate across our differences, not let them divide us.

After Sept. 11, 2001, the public psyche in the United States was punctured, our nation had been attacked on the mainland unlike ever before, and many Americans overpersonalized the new risk and felt unsafe.
People, even in the days before social media, attached voyeuristically to the news, and cycles of worry resulted that interfered with sleep and work. I believe the outsized fear of health risks that followed (anthrax, smallpox, West Nile virus, SARS) were tied directly to Americans' newfound vulnerability. 
I also pointed out then that, despite our worries, we still lived in a much safer environment than Israel, a country with narrow borders surviving under the constant threats of invasion, rocket fire and suicide bombing. In Israel, these regular dangers were studied and found to increase risks of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, especially in lower-income areas of southern Israel.
Yet, Israelis shouldered on, and visitors (including me), were reassured by the relative calm, business as usual, a regular police and military presence, religious faith and beautiful vistas. Israel has always been much tougher and more resilient than we have been in America.
Until now.
Videos of mutilated bodies circulated by Hamas and the discovery of decapitated bodies, which according the Jerusalem Post included babies, have shaken Israel and the world to its core. A strong and growing military response has started to put salve on the wound as the borders have been re-secured and Gaza is under military assault.
Even so, the wound is deep, and for Israelis it might never fully heal. They might never feel that they are fully safe again.
For the rest of us, the anxiety drawn from savagery permeates us with no treatment in sight, deteriorating into cycles of worry and anxiety as the Middle East further destabilizes.
As a Jew, I have always resisted any comparisons to the incomparable suffering and dehumanization of the Holocaust. But the fact is that the atrocities committed by Hamas this month, the inhumanity and depravity, are reminiscent of the Holocaust, although on a much smaller scale. 
Harvard for Hamas?Something is very twisted on America's university campuses
What to do? How to heal? Strong emotions like fear involve the prefrontal cortex and amygdala of the brain. This fear overrides reason, but it turns out that other strong emotions – including courage, love and empathy – also flow through the same area. This is why compassion for the victims and for the families who have lost loved ones is the best response, as is courage.
For parents, it is best that you show courage, compassion and love to your children while answering their questions.
It also is helpful at a time like this to continue your daily routine with work and exercise and try to divert yourself from worry with activities that are meaningful and make you laugh.
Volunteering to help if you have useful skills or making donations toward the region's recovery are also therapeutic actions to take.
Our interfaith group survived Hamas hit.But blockade on Gaza now haunts us.
Perhaps most important during a time such as this is that we can look to leaders who have the strength to guide us. Whatever you think of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu politically, he is such a leader − at least for now. He knows that the main tool of terrorists is fear, not bombs, and he won’t succumb to it.
It is good to remember that he and his brother Yoni, who was killed in the 1976 raid to rescue 105 Jewish hostages held by Palestinian terrorists in Uganda, were leaders in the top commando unit in Israel (Sayeret Matkal). One of the best special operations units in the world, its purpose is to seek out and destroy enemies on their territory.
I don’t believe that “Bibi” will negotiate. Terrorists prey on weakness. He will use force and skill to seek out and destroy Hamas. If he succeeds, it will help start to heal the psychic wounds. 
Israel standing up for itself should inspire courage, not just throughout Israel but anywhere in the world where political agendas are not obfuscating the truth. Courage and compassion will get us all through.

Editor's note: Antonie Lamar Moss Jr., 19, and Jeremy Heglar, 16, were shot inside a car in Columbus, Ohio. Moss, nicknamed Fatman, died at the scene. Heglar succumbed to his injuries at a local hospital. Cayon Drake, 18 at the time of his arrest in April, pleaded not guilty to murder and other felony charges related to the slayings.
Shawnta Willis, Moss' mom, penned this letter, which first published at The Columbus Dispatch. She is part of the nonprofit Mothers of Murdered Columbus Children.
I want to start by saying I love you and I will always love you.
There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think of you. It's hard for me to sit here and write this letter knowing the things I’m about to write are the things that I thought about over and over again.
I have honestly questioned myself about if I had something to do with you physically not being here anymore.
March 1, 2004, was the happiest day of my life. Nineteen years later, April 18, 2023, became the day that will haunt me forever.
It hurts me so bad that I am not able to see you, talk to you, touch you, or even just smell your scent.
Your sisters miss you dearly.
With you not being here there is a piece missing to what was once a perfect puzzle. When you were little, I did everything possible to shelter you from the negativity of the streets.
I did not allow you to play with toy guns or even play video game that had guns in them. I wrecked my brain wondering if that was a good idea, or did it just make you more curious later on in life.
Man, I wish you were here to answer.
I kept you active all year-round playing sports, just so you wouldn’t be bored or have idle time on your hands. I’m sure you would remember coming home not being able to go outside until your homework was complete.
I even went as far as sending you to a Christian school. I wish you were here to tell me when and where things went wrong.
No one is perfect and I know you did your best. I promise I tried my best, only to feel defeated in the end. We would talk daily about things that made you happy, or even things that may have bothered you.
I wish I could ask you what caused you to look at life differently as you got older.
I hate that I’m asking or writing all of these questions, only to get no response. It bothers me that you were only 19, you were still a kid with a lot more learning and growing to do.
Your life was not the only life that was cut short that night. That night two other kids’ lives were taken away as well.
I can only be honest with you, and that’s something you know I had no problem with doing. My life was shattered that night as well as others; it will never be the same.
Overwhelmed by the war in Israel?Here's how to protect your mental health.
Never in a million years would I have thought I would’ve had to see you (my one and only son), lying lifeless on a cold ground from night to early morning. At that moment authorities were unable to tell me if that was you or not. It is my job as a parent to protect you and that night I was unable to.
Moving forward, I made a vow to keep your name alive by telling your story, better yet “our story,” to other parents and kids.
I want them to know that when it comes to gun violence, there are no rules or exceptions. As the old folks would say, a bullet has no name on it.
Good, bad, right or wrong, guns kill.
I know that deep in my heart if you were still here you would answer these questions, and we would’ve worked together to change the narrative of our story.
With that being said, son I love you and I will forever scream "Fatman" until we meet again.
Love always, Mom.
Suzanne Somers has died at the age of 76, and the loss has been felt among fans around the world.
"Devastated to hear about the passing of Suzanne Somers," @marc_k011 wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. "A true icon and overall amazing human being."
"I'm truthfully devastated with the death of Suzanne Somers. She was a great actress, but had a deeper heart in life," @MichaelKerner20 wrote. "She was a sweetheart!!!"
Grief is different for everyone, and experts say mourning someone you didn't personally know − a phenomenon called collective or public grief − is a complicated, yet valid, experience.
"Collective and public grief, as I call it, is always unique in how we attach," David Kessler, grief expert and founder of Grief.com, previously told USA TODAY.
This form of grief can be further compounded when the death of a beloved public figure is read about unexpectedly in the news.
"When people experience sudden loss, they may feel shocked, disbelief, confused, and even in denial," Shavonne Moore-Lobban, licensed psychologist, previously told USA TODAY. "The suddenness of the loss may be too much to process and feel too unreal for a person to immediately grasp."
More:Suzanne Somers, star of 'Three's Company' and 'Step by Step,' dead at 76
Somers' longtime publicist, R. Couri Hay, shared a statement on behalf of the actress' family with the news Sunday. The actress, who "survived an aggressive form" of breast cancer for over 23 years, "passed away peacefully at home in the early morning hours" on Sunday," the statement read.
"Sudden loss can be more shocking and people can feel less 'prepared' than they might with expected loss," Moore-Lobban added. "However, it is still hard to prepare for anything that is life-altering, whether a person knew it was coming."

Many have parasocial relationships with those in the public eye, be it celebrities, politicians, news anchors. You feel close to them like they're your friend or relative.
Just because collective or public grief doesn't match how one might grieve someone close to them, that doesn't make the experience any less real.
"It's a fascinating thing that people don't realize we really can grieve people we didn't know," Kessler added. "And it doesn't mean we're going to grieve them like our spouse or mother, father, or sister or child, but we will grieve them."

If you're trying to comfort someone going through loss, don't try to minimize it or put a timetable to the grieving process.
"There is no limit to grief and because it is a cycle or process, it will continue as long as it needs to for the person who is experiencing it," Moore-Lobban said.
If you're going through loss yourself, talk about it. This "might mean acknowledging it and being open with someone you trust, about how you are feeling," Moore-Lobban said. "It might also include engaging in therapy with a mental health provider, which can be individual or group therapy. Talking about it can also occur by writing, meaning a person can journal about how they feel and what they are thinking."
The deaths of public figures may also serve as opportunities to widen discussions on grief.
"We have a relationship with death that we don't quite know how to explore as a society," Kessler said. "I always tell people the death rate is 100%. So we know we're all going to die someday, intellectually, but we don't know, is death the great enemy? Is it the great comforter, when we're in pain? We sort of don't know how to hold it."

You may have heard that the polyphenol curcumin may have beneficial effects on your health. To your glee, you may have busted out the taco seasoning or whipped out the cumin to create your own blend. 
But wait one second. Curcumin is not the same thing as the spice cumin. Curcumin is actually the active ingredient in the spice turmeric. Yes, it is confusing. 
So, can curcumin or turmeric help our health? We spoke with Ilisa Nussbaum, a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist at Yale Children's Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut to find out everything you need to know about the difference between these two things, and how they can impact our health. 
To understand curcumin, we first need to understand polyphenols. Polyphenols are compounds found in many plant foods, and they generally act as antioxidants, which can help protect the plants (and subsequently, those who eat the plants) from cell damage. 
Nussbaum explains, “Curcumin is a polyphenol, and it is the active component of turmeric. It actually gives turmeric that beautiful golden color that everyone loves. It's a root of a plant and it's botanically related to ginger.” 
More:Turmeric has many purported health benefits. Does science back any of them up?
While curcumin is found inside of turmeric, they are not the same thing. Turmeric will contain other active ingredients like demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin. That’s a mouthful! 
Curcumin's (and turmeric’s) claim to fame is its effect on inflammation. Nussbaum says, “(Curcumin) has been shown to have tons of antioxidant properties and lots of anti-inflammation properties. It has been studied and shown to help with things like colitis and arthritis. Any disease that has some inflammation component to it.” 
Although there can be some benefits, there are also some drawbacks. The Micronutrient Information Center at the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University says that the therapeutic potential for curcumin may be limited by poor bioavailability, or the ability to be absorbed by the body, particularly as an oral supplement. 
Nussbaum also articulated some of her concerns, “The risk that you're running with curcumin, and I have seen this happen in people that are taking the curcumin supplements because it's so condensed and so concentrated that it can cause kidney stones. And it can interfere with some medications.” She further emphasizes, “So if you're someone that's taking curcumin supplements, it's really important to talk to your physician and find out if it is going to interfere with any medications that you're on, particularly chemotherapy medications and blood thinners.” 
Dietary supplements:What are dietary supplements and how can they lead to better health?
You may have seen this spice on menus from around the globe. It’s an especially popular addition to grains like rice or flavorful curries. Its earthy and slightly sweet flavor adds a unique zest that makes you crave more and more. Adding it to your cooking results in a beautiful golden color that makes for an eye-popping presentation. You may have guessed it: saffron. 
Given saffron’s range in cuisines from all over the world, many have questions about it. What is saffron? Why is it so expensive? Does it offer nutritional value? We spoke with Ilisa Nussbaum, a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist at Yale Children's Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut, to find out everything you need to know about this special spice. 
Saffron is a spice derived from the crocus sativus flower (sometimes referred to as simply the saffron crocus.) According to the Food Network, saffron is commonly found in Indian, Moroccan and Iranian cuisines, but its influence is found in European dishes as well, like Spanish paella or Italian risotto. 
The part of the flower that is used to make the spice is the reddish-brown threads found in the flower. Nussbaum says it’s expensive because of how it’s harvested. “It's super, super expensive and that's because it's actually from the stigma of a flower, and it’s really difficult to harvest,” she explains. “You need people to actually pull it (the saffron threads) off individually,” she adds. 
There is also the issue of supply and demand. Saffron is largely grown in Greece, Iran, Morocco and India, so it’s expensive to import it here to the United States. 
Some groups have historically used saffron for its sedative effects, to treat muscle spasms, to aid in digestion and more. In Western medical practice, it’s unlikely that your healthcare provider will recommend saffron to treat a particular illness or disease but rather to supplement a healthy, well-rounded diet. However, this doesn’t mean that saffron doesn’t have properties that are beneficial for your health. Like many spices, it contains vital antioxidants. “It is known to be an antioxidant, but it also has been studied as a potential antidepressant – which I find so fascinating, that gut-brain connection,” says Nussbaum. “It’s also supposed to potentially aid in memory,” she adds. 
More research is needed to understand the potential therapeutic benefits of saffron – but for now, you have the go-ahead to add it to your favorite recipe.

Whenever one experiences growth hormones, peptide hormones, thyroid hormones, stress hormones or sex hormones, the body's chemical messengers play a key role in many essential bodily functions and make a big difference in how we feel both emotionally and physically.
Testosterone, for instance, is a sex hormone that affects muscle mass, bone density, mood, body composition, libido, cognitive function and one's immune system, per research available at the National Library of Medicine. Testosterone is essential in the development of male growth, but it's also present in the ovaries and adrenal glands of women. 
Due to its many important functions in the body, it can be helpful to have one's testosterone levels checked with a blood test if anything feels amiss. Signs and symptoms that could indicate diminished testosterone levels in men or women include frequent feelings of melancholy, sluggishness or tiredness, muscle weakness, decreasing sexual desire, sexual performance issues, or reduced sexual satisfaction. In women, low testosterone can also affect menstrual cycles and the frequency of periods. 
Additional signs of low testosterone include a loss of body hair since testosterone promotes body hair growth. Diminished testosterone levels can also affect one's ability to build and store muscles; low testosterone can cause one to gain fat instead and lead to sudden weight gain.
Such symptoms can be as disconcerting as they are common. Low testosterone levels affect about one in every four men over the age of 30, according to one report. And though less common in women since a woman's main sex hormones are estrogen and progesterone, women can and often do also experience lower-than-normal levels of testosterone as well. 
In case you missed:Men often struggle with penis insecurity. But no one wants to talk about it.
Testosterone levels can be increased several ways – some natural and some that require medical intervention. The natural ways of increasing testosterone levels include improved sleep, decreasing one's stress levels, a diet that includes plenty of protein, zinc and vitamin D and getting more exercise. Indeed, one study showed that increased physical activity was more beneficial than calorie restriction alone for increasing testosterone levels. Resistance training has also been shown to boost testosterone levels. Such benefits can be multiplied when they also mean dropping weight for people dealing with obesity. "For those who are overweight, weight loss will aid in increasing testosterone levels," explains Dr. Disha Narang, an endocrinologist at Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital.
When it comes to medical interventions, there are a host of testosterone creams, supplements, and even injectables available – but the experts warn to use them with caution. "There are no FDA-approved supplements to increase testosterone levels, and any supplement touting sexual health or testosterone-boosting should be questioned for several possible associated risks," warns Narang.
There are times, however, when testosterone therapy will be recommended by a physician for men or for women, sometimes for different reasons.
When women consider testosterone therapy, it's often related to a condition called Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD), explains Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel, a clinical professor of medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. "Testosterone can be administered to these women who are diagnosed with this (HSDD) postmenopausal-related decline in sexual interest," she says. She adds that in such cases, when testosterone therapy is elected for women, clinicians often use only about 1/10 the dose of preparations approved for men since women produce and need significantly less testosterone than men in the first place.
Regardless of the recommended dose, it's important to only medically increase testosterone levels under the care of a physician because there some possible negative side effects associated with the therapy. Such risks and side effects include acne or other skin reactions, a worsening of sleep apnea symptoms, enlarged breasts or a stimulating of a noncancerous growth of the prostate, increased risk of blood clot formations or even an increased risk of heart disease, per Mayo Clinic.
What's more, "elevated testosterone levels in males are associated with decreased sperm count, shrinking of testicles and infertility," warns Narang. Dr. Andrew Greenberg, director of the Obesity and Metabolism Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, says that for these reasons and others, he recommends caution when considering the use of testosterone therapy.
"One needs to consult a physician who has experience in endocrinology and testosterone therapy if wanting to do this," he suggests.

More celebrities are reacting to the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, where the death toll on both sides surpassed 4,000 on Monday, with thousands more wounded.
Pink and Riz Ahmed posted statements on social media as the world braced Monday for an expected Israeli ground invasion of Gaza aimed at crushing Hamas. Meanwhile, the Academy Museum Gala postponed its annual fundraiser, and a red carpet for the upcoming Sofia Coppola film "Priscilla" has been canceled.
Last week, over 700 actors, comedians, musicians, and power players of the Hollywood community signed an open letter denouncing Hamas' "barbaric acts of terrorism" in Israel and calling for the return of hostages.
Here's what more celebrities are saying.
Oscar-winning British actor and rapper Riz Ahmed called for the end of the "indiscriminate bombing of Gaza's civilians and vital infrastructure, the denial of food, water, and electricity, and the forced displacement of people from their homes" on his social media platforms.
"These are indefensible war crimes," he continued. "We need to put ourselves in the shoes of the people of Gaza, now, before we all walk past the point of no return."
The "Sound of Metal" actor also denounced the actions of Hamas, calling the attack "horrific and wrong."
Pink, who is currently on the North American leg of her Summer Carnival tour, claimed in an X post that she has received "many threats" from people who mistook Poi flags displayed at her live shows for Israeli flags. The singer clarified that the flags "were used many, many years ago by the Māori people in New Zealand and because they and the Māori people are beautiful to me, we use them."
"I have been using Poi flags since the beginning of this tour," she said. "I do not fly flags in my show in support of anything or anyone except the rainbow flag. That will remain my position."
She continued, "I am a human. I believe in peace. Equality. Love. I am deeply saddened by the state of the world. I pray for all of us."
The war has caused reverberations in Hollywood, too.
On Oct. 12, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles announced the red carpet for its annual fundraising gala on Oct. 14 would be canceled "out of respect for the devastating conflict and loss of life happening overseas."
"The Academy Museum condemns all forms of hate and cruelty and stands in support of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives affected by the ongoing violence," the museum's statement reads.
Meryl Streep, Oprah Winfrey, Michael B. Jordan and Sofia Coppola were set to be honored at the event.
Similarly, the red-carpet premiere for the Sofia Coppola film "Priscilla," which is based on the love story of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, was canceled in response to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," A24 Films confirmed to USA TODAY in an email.
"Out of respect for the events going on in the world, we will be forgoing a red carpet for the 'Priscilla' Los Angeles premiere," the studio said in an email to the press.
'Horrific':Gal Gadot, Gigi Hadid, Kim Kardashian support Israel amid Palestinian conflict
One of the world's most enduring and intractable conflicts connects to a century of competing claims to land, borders and rights in a region of deep historical and religious significance.
The United Nations in 1947 tried to divide the-then British Mandate of Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states. A year later, when the state of Israel was created, the first Arab-Israeli War broke out. Ever since Israel's victory and following several other wars, Palestinians have gradually been displaced from territory that they also see as their rightful homeland.

Happy National Boss Day — but don't tell Bruce Springsteen.
He hates being called the Boss.
Yes, Oct. 16 is National Boss Day, created in 1958 when Illinois resident Patricia Bays Haroski registered National Boss’ Day with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Her boss was also her dad. Illinois Governor Otto Kerner made the date official in 1962 by proclamation, and here we are.
Springsteen was called the Boss by bandmates even before he became famous. The Boss was in charge, on stage and off. Before and after shows, Springsteen was the main guy.
“My recollection was the Boss was a result of paying (band members and crew) at the end of the week,” said Springsteen to Mark Hagen for Mojo in 1999. The interview is included in the “Talk About a Dream” compilation edited by Christopher Phillips and Louis R. Masur.
“It was never meant for public dissemination," Springsteen said.
Once the Boss nickname became known outside of the intimate band circle, Springsteen regretted it. The nickname is contrary to Springsteen's hard-working everyman ethos.
“Well, the thing I have with this 'Boss' is funny, because it came from people ... who work around you,” said Springsteen to Dave DiMartino in a 1980 Creem magazine interview, also in “Talk About a Dream.”
"And then, somebody started to do it on the radio. I hate being called 'Boss' (laughs). I just do. Always did from the beginning. I hate bosses. I hate being called the Boss.”
National Boss Day comes a few weeks after New Jersey residents celebrated Bruce Springsteen Day, which saw the singer turning 74 years old.
Springsteen and the E Street Band are taking a break from their tour as the "Born to Run" singer is being treated for symptoms of peptic ulcer disease. Earlier this month, the band announced the new dates for this fall's rescheduled U.S. shows, which will take place in March and April as well as August and September 2024.

"I'm on the mend":Bruce Springsteen postpones all 2023 concerts to treat peptic ulcer disease
The Dallas Cowboys are bringing in a country music legend to perform at their Thanksgiving halftime show this year.
Dolly Parton will take the stage for the Cowboys' annual Thanksgiving Day halftime show, according to an announcement from the team.
The announcement, which was a video posted to social media Monday morning, showed a group of cheerleaders adding sequins to a football and helmet before cutting to Parton herself, decked out in Cowboys gear.
"I'll see y'all this Thanksgiving!" she says, ringing a Salvation Army bell.
Salvation Army is the sponsor of the annual Red Kettle Kickoff halftime show the Cowboys have put on during every Thanksgiving game they've played for the last 27 years.

Dallas take on the Washington Commanders on Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 23, at 4:30 p.m. ET CBS.
NFL halftime shows:Usher is the latest to headline a star-studded list of Super Bowl halftime shows
Parton will perform her biggest hits as well as some songs from her forthcoming album, "Rockstar," during the halftime show, according to a press release from The Salvation Army.
“Wow! What an honor to get to kick off The Salvation Army’s Red Kettle Campaign with the halftime show during the Dallas Cowboys game this Thanksgiving,” Parton said in the press release. “Those Red Kettles have long been a symbol of hope for our friends and neighbors who are facing hard times. My goal is to encourage everyone who can to donate and support their neighbors in need. Every small act of generosity helps, and together, we can all love our neighbors this holiday season and beyond.”
The Salvation Army's Red Kettle Campaign began in 1891 to raise money to help feed those in need during the holiday season, according to The Salvation Army's website.
Dolly Parton:Country music legend wanted Tina Turner for her new 'Rockstar' album: 'I had the perfect song'
Parton's album, "Rockstar," will be her 49th studio album and her first foray into the rock genre. It will feature collaborations from numerous rock legends, including Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr of The Beatles, Sting, Stevie Nicks and more. Parton will also cover several classic rock songs on the record. The album is slated to release with 30 tracks.
The country music superstar has released four promotional singles ahead of the album's Nov. 17 release: "World on Fire," "Magic Man," "Bygones," "We Are the Champions"/"We Will Rock You," "Let It Be," and "What's Up?"
The Cowboys have hosted a game on Thanksgiving Day every year since 1966, with the only exceptions being 1975 and 1977, when the then-St. Louis Cardinals hosted instead.
The Red Kettle Kickoff Halftime Show has been a tradition at the Cowboys' Thanksgiving games for the last 27 years, and an interesting trend has emerged regarding the halftime performers. When a country artist is invited to perform at the Thanksgiving halftime show, the Cowboys are 4-10. When the performer is a pop star, Dallas is 7-2, including last year, when the Jonas Brothers performed.
The Cowboys are 32-22-1 all-time on Thanksgiving Day. Their opponents this year, the Commanders, are 4-8 all-time in Thanksgiving Day matchups.
NFL Week 6 winners and losers:Lions look like legit contender, Giants trip themselves up
Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher is going on tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the British rock band's 1994 debut album, "Definitely Maybe," the lead vocalist announced in a statement released on Instagram Monday.
"I'm bouncing around the house to announce the Definitely Maybe tour," read the statement. "The most important album of the '90s bar none. I wouldn't be anywhere without it and neither would you, so let's celebrate together."
The monthlong tour around the United Kingdom kicks off in Sheffield, England, in June 2024.
The tour will include performances of the tracks "Whatever," "Fade Away," "Listen Up," and "Sad Song." Gallagher made no mention of performing "Wonderwall," the group's biggest hit, which appeared on the band's second studio album, "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?" released in 1995.
USA TODAY has reached out to the band's representatives for comment.
Oasis unexpectedly disbanded in 2009, when Gallagher's brother, Noel Gallagher, chief songwriter and lead guitarist, left the group. Noel Gallagher went on to form his own group, Gallagher's High Flying Birds, while the remaining members of Oasis briefly continued as Beady Eye.
Until now, the band has denied ever reuniting.
The reunion could include Noel Gallagher and co-founding band member, guitarist Paul Arthurs. Arthurs, stage name Bonehead, began touring with Liam Gallagher again earlier this year after a battle with tonsil cancer.
However, on Live Nation, where tickets for the tour go on sale Friday, Liam Gallagher is listed as the performer, not Oasis.
It is unclear whether other previous band members, including Paul McGuigan, Tony McCarroll, Alan White, Gem Archer, Andy Bell and, most recently, Zak Starkey and Chris Sharrock, would return.
The Darknesswants you to put down your phones and pay attention to concerts
This summer, Noel Gallagher was asked at a live Q&A who would be on a hypothetical reunion tour.
"So me, Liam. Well, it's a funny thing because we're all at a certain age now," he said. "Hair was a thing in Oasis, so we'll have to see what everybody's hair is looking like. I'm in no matter what."
Fans who find themselves in the United Kingdom next year can get tickets for the "Definitely Maybe" anniversary tour at 4 a.m. ET Friday.
Tickets are available on Live Nation at livenation.co.uk, which lists Liam Gallagher as the performer, across 12 dates in Sheffield, England; Cardiff, Wales; London; Manchester, England; and Glasgow, Scotland. Tickets for the Dublin dates are available at Ticketmaster at ticketmaster.ie.
Joey Fatonesurprised by success of NSYNC reunion song 'Better Place': 'It just all worked'
LAS VEGAS – Raiders coach Josh McDaniels expressed relief that the back injury that knocked quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo out of Sunday’s game against the New England Patriots wasn’t much worse. But Garoppolo’s availability for next weekend is still uncertain.
McDaniels, speaking to media on Monday morning, said the major concern was that Garoppolo suffered internal injuries as he was taken by ambulance from Allegiant Stadium to a local hospital. Tests apparently ruled out internal injuries.
“Seems like we’ve dodged a big bullet in that regard,” McDaniels said. “So that’s good news.”
Further tests are pending, McDaniels said, leaving Garoppolo’s status a question mark for Sunday’s game at Chicago.
“There’s still a lot to uncover,” McDaniels said. “We’ll make sure we’re doing all the right things moving forward. But the prognosis is a lot better than it might have otherwise been.”
NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.
McDaniels did not indicate whether Brian Hoyer or rookie Aidan O’Connell would start on Sunday for the Raiders (3-3) if Garoppolo is sidelined again. Hoyer played the entire second half in relieving Garoppolo during the 21-17 victory against the Patriots. O’Connell started in place of an injured Garoppolo in Week 4 against the Los Angeles Chargers.
“The fact that we’ve played three guys already certainly doesn’t hurt,” McDaniels said. “It’s not ideal in terms of what you want to do, but they’ve both got some experience and they’ve both had to operate our offense in critical situations and close games. That’s helpful for them, too.”
Every bit of integrity the International Olympic Committee had is going to be in shreds by the time Thomas Bach walks out the door.
The IOC’s despot has already debased the Games he so claims to love with his devotion to Vladimir Putin and refusal to do anything while Russia blatantly undercuts the principles of the Olympic movement time and again. Now he’s laying the groundwork to be king for life, like the autocrats he’s cozied up to throughout most of his reign.
Under the current Olympic charter, which Bach himself helped write, the IOC president can serve a maximum of 12 years. Bach was first elected, to an eight-year term, in September 2013, then re-elected for four more years in 2021.
Which means his tenure as president should end in September 2025, following the election of a new president.
But lo and behold, some “concerned” IOC members raised the idea Sunday of Bach staying beyond the term limits. It would require the Olympic charter to be rewritten and for a key anti-corruption measure enacted after the Salt Lake City bid scandal to be removed. But what’s a little banana republic governance when it’s to Bach’s benefit!
“A number of these colleagues think and feel an election campaign, so early before the election, would be disrupting the preparations for the Olympic Games in Paris, which are so important for the entire Olympic movement. They would like to avoid this,” Bach said Monday morning.
This reasoning, if you can call it that, is nonsensical. Given the Olympics are held every two years, an election is always going to overlap with the preparations for a Games. If IOC members are worried about disrupting the leadup to Paris, what’s to keep them from saying the same ahead of Milan in 2026? Or Los Angeles in 2028? Or Brisbane in 2032? Or … you get the picture.
And if the preparations for Paris are so fraught the IOC can’t possibly spare the mental bandwidth for an election, whose fault is that? Last I checked, Bach was the IOC president when Paris was awarded the 2024 Olympics and has been president throughout the entire leadup. If the city isn’t ready, that’s on Bach, and is further reason to move on from him, not keep him around even longer.
There also hasn’t been a parade of IOC members declaring their wish to be the Olympic governing body’s next president. The only one who’s come close is Sebastian Coe — which probably explains Bach’s willingness to trample on Olympic norms once again.
Coe, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in track and field, became president of World Athletics after running the organizing committee for the wildly successful London Games in 2012. And unlike Bach, he’s been steadfast in holding Russia accountable for its many transgressions against the Olympic movement.
Russia had only one track and field athlete at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics because Coe refused to lift a ban imposed as punishment for the country’s sophisticated, state-sponsored doping program. He was similarly tough in Tokyo, when fewer than a dozen Russian athletes were cleared to compete.
And while other international federations have gradually caved to Bach’s wish that “individual neutral athletes” from Russia and Belarus be allowed to return to competition despite the ongoing atrocities in Ukraine, Coe has refused.
“The death and destruction we have seen in Ukraine over the past year, including the deaths of some 185 athletes, have only hardened my resolve on this matter,” Coe said in March.
The only resolve Bach has shown is to sell out the Olympics at every turn.
Imagining and implementing a sophisticated doping program to rig the medal count, as Russia did, goes against everything the Olympics represent. So, too, its blatant defiance of sanctions that were already laughably light. But not for Bach! There’s no sin by Putin and Russia he can’t forgive.
China has a well-documented history of abusing human rights, and its treatment of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang has been characterized as genocide. The Winter Olympics in Beijing made a mockery of the IOC’s supposed priority of sustainability. To Bach, however, President Xi Jinping and China were ideal partners!
Being the IOC president is a political job, yes. But it’s also a sacred trust. The Olympics are supposed to represent the best of humanity and remind us what we’re capable of when we strive for greatness and refuse to accept the limitations put on us. The IOC, and its president in particular, have no greater responsibility than to foster and protect that environment.
Maybe Bach believed in that mission once, but his actions since taking office have repeatedly betrayed both the ideals behind the Olympics and the people whose sweat and sacrifice make them so awe-inspiring. He’s done enough damage, and doesn’t deserve the chance to do more.

Aaron Rodgers, offensive consultant?
While he may still be recovering from a ruptured left Achilles tendon, the New York Jets quarterback has been a steady presence around the team and reportedly even offered suggestions to the team's coaching staff during New York's 20-14 upset victory Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles.
According to the Athletic, Rodgers wore a headset during the game and was communicating with coaches as backup Zach Wilson led New York's offense. The Jets still struggled to move the ball, converting only two-of-11 third-down attempts, collecting just 244 total yards of offense (the Eagles gained 348) and recording 17 first downs, compared to Philadelphia's 24.
This came after Rodgers showed up to the stadium and walked into the Jets locker room without the aid of crutches, a little more than a month after he underwent surgery to repair the tendon. Rodgers was on the field during pre-game warmups, even casually flinging passes, a sign that he may be well ahead of the projected rehab for the injury.
"He wanted to be on the sidelines," Jets head coach Robert Saleh said Sunday in a news conference. "It's unbelievable. A lot of people that I have talked to − I won't name names but who have also had it − that everyone is in awe that he is even walking. For him to be on the sideline standing the entire time, he's a freakazoid."

Wilson completed 19-of-33 passes for 186 yards in the victory. He has shown some marginal improvements this season, by and large avoiding costly mistakes. Still, for New York to be consistently competitive in Rodgers' absence, it will need Wilson to take strides.
"I think he was mostly in there talking to the coaches," Wilson said of Rodgers after the game. "Obviously, my headset is just with (offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett), but it's always good having him around."
Rodgers, 39, was traded to the Jets in April after he spent 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, becoming the longest-tenured player in franchise history. Rodgers re-worked his deal to take a $35 million paycut in a two-year contract that runs through the 2024 season.
The college basketball season tips off in just a few weeks. In anticipation of that, we bring you the preseason USA TODAY Sports coaches poll, presented in conjunction with the National Association of Basketball Coaches.
While preseason rankings often prove to be an imperfect measure of future success, they do offer a look at which programs are viewed as having the most talent. As such, one might expect to see a lot of familiar schools named in the Top 25. That is true, but there are also some relative upstart programs that made a big splash a few months ago in March Madness.
Kansas, one of those perennial powers, will open the year at No. 1. The Jayhawks were voted first by 23 of the 32 panelists. It will be the first preseason No. 1 ranking for Kansas since 2018, and its fifth since USA TODAY began administering the coaches poll in the 1991-92 season.
Purdue opens at No. 2, its highest ever preseason spot in the coaches poll. The Boilermakers received five first-place votes, with three more No. 1 nods going to Duke. The Blue Devils will start at No. 3, followed by No. 4 Michigan State.

OUTLOOKS:In-depth previews for every team in the preseason Top 25
The final first-place vote went to defending national champion Connecticut, which will begin at No. 5 overall. All of last season’s Final Four teams are in the preseason poll, headed by the Huskies. That group includes Florida Atlantic, on the heels of its surprising run to the last weekend of the season as a No. 9 regional seed. The Owls were voted No. 9 for their first ever preseason ranking. The other Final Four participants, Miami (Fla.) and runner up San Diego State, open at No. 13 and 15 respectively.
Kansas heads a list of four representatives of the expanded Big 12 in the preseason rankings. The list also includes league newcomer Houston at No. 6 as well as No. 17 Baylor and No. 18 Texas. The Big East also claims four spots, with No. 7 Marquette and No. 8 Creighton joining UConn in the top 10. The SEC has the most team in the Top 25 with five, headed by No. 10 Tennessee.

Beginning Jan. 1, it’s lowering the threshold to qualify for A-List and A-List preferred status.
According to the airline, the new requirements will be 20 qualifying one-way flights for A-List status, down from 25, and 40 qualifying one-way flights for A-List Preferred status, down from 50. The thresholds to earn those statuses through tier qualifying points (TQPs) will remain at 35,000 and 70,000 respectively.
Jonathan Clarkson, Southwest’s vice president of marketing, acknowledged that these changes are going against the grain of other updates in the airline rewards realm.
“While I’d love to say that we’re so nimble we did an immediate response, it just isn’t the case. We’ve been working on this for a while,” he told USA TODAY, referencing Delta Air Lines’ recent changes. “At a time when other programs, plural, are making it harder to achieve tier status, we’re making it easier.” 
Southwest is also lowering the spend-to-earn threshold on its co-branded credit cards. Rapid Rewards Premier, Priority, Premier Business, or Performance Business cardholders will now receive 1,500 TQPs for every $5,000 in spending, down from the current $10,000.
Other frequent flyer programs have seen a swelling of their elite ranks in recent years, diluting the benefits for some loyal travelers, but Clarkson said he’s not concerned about a similar scenario unfolding at Southwest.
“That was one of the criteria we used when we talked about how we arrived at these benefits. Foremost was ensuring that whatever changes we make didn’t result in bloating the program,” he said. “It will result in a larger program we anticipate, but not to the point where it erodes the benefit of the people who get to take advantage of it.”

The airline announced other changes to Rapid Rewards benefits as well, including the option to book tickets using a combination of cash and points. Previously, Southwest tickets had to be purchased using all cash or exclusively points.
Clarkson said A-List Preferred members will also be entitled to up to two free alcoholic drinks per flight. He added that vouchers for those drinks will be embedded in the passenger’s boarding pass scanner code, rather than travelers needing to present physical certificates onboard.
Customer feedback has been positive about the changes so far, according to Clarkson. He said the changes were workshopped with frequent flyers before they were announced.
“This is another example of Southwest deciding to zig when everybody else zags,” he said. “We have a program we want people to use and get the benefit of.” 
JetBlue, Frontier Airlines and Alaska Airlines all moved to capitalize on Delta’s unpopular changes to their loyalty program by enticing flyers with generous matching programs.

Staples is probably not the first place you think of when planning a trip, but the office supply giant is actively trying to change that.
According to a press release, the place you go to get your school supplies wants to become “the first stop of nonstop travel,” in large part by letting you register for TSA PreCheck on site.
Staples has offered the service in 250 stores in the last five years and helped process 2.5 million PreCheck applications in that time.
“As the travel landscape has dramatically shifted over the past several years, we want to meet our customers where they need us in order to alleviate the stress commonly associated with travel services,” Craig Grayson, Staples’ senior vice president of services of Services told USA TODAY in an email. “Whether you need a passport expedited, want a hassle-free way to sign up for TSA PreCheck, or simply need to snap a few passport photos, we’re here to support both leisure and business travelers in an increasingly major way.”
Grayson said Staples sales associates at participating stores are credentialed through the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration to process PreCheck applications, including taking your fingerprints.

For their September honeymoon, Ricky Berns and his wife Allie went to their dream destination: Santorini, Greece. 
The couple stayed at multiple hotels for the “truly unforgettable” trip, including the Vedema, a Luxury Collection Resort and Mystique, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Berns, 29, told USA TODAY. 
In 2022, the average honeymoon cost $5,100, according to a study of over 12,000 couples by wedding website The Knot. To cover the trip, most couples said they used their own savings and some set up a honeymoon fund as part of their wedding registry. 
The average rate for the two Greek hotels is up to $503 and $978 a night, respectively.
But the couple didn't have to pay that in cash. They were able to use points already accumulated with Ricky’s family’s The Marriott Vacation Clubs timeshare to cover these two resorts. The timeshare has been in the Berns family since 1997 and has allowed the family to travel to Maui and Oahu in Hawaii, Spain, the Caribbean, Disney World in Florida and more.

Now that Ricky Berns and his sister Carlee, 25, are adults, they said they’re looking forward to inheriting the timeshare. Carlee Berns, for her part, said she cherishes the memories made on those family trips, recognizing “what this investment can give to me in my future and for a future family.”
The Berns siblings are part of the growing group of younger Americans who are turning to timeshares as a way to travel the world.
Today, over half of timeshare owners are Gen Z and millennials and the average age of a timeshare owner is 39, according to a 2022 report by the American Resort Development Association. Not all of these owners are inheriting their timeshares either – 53% of millennials and Gen Z account for new sales purchases. For The Marriott Vacation Clubs, over 66% of first-time buyers are under the age of 42. 
Here’s how timeshares evolved and why they are appealing to younger Americans:

Many younger Americans work remotely these days, opening the door to more flexible travel schedules. Timeshares have also turned more customizable and robust, according to the Resort Development Association. For those who want to travel each year and can afford it now – the average purchase price for a new buyer is $22,000 – timeshares could save them money in the long run. 
“The timeshare helps me accomplish my travel goals because there are endless possibilities all around the world,” Ricky Berns said. “Knowing you can go anywhere in the world with the same top service helps ease the stress of travel.”
Timeshares now often include more than just a week in the same destination. They offer cruises, guided tours, houseboat rentals, off-property outdoor adventures and more. You can even get in on specialty packages for events like The NHL Stanley Cup Program, which includes hotel accommodations (with daily breakfast), a rental car and two tickets to one of the final games.
Some timeshares, such as The Marriott Vacation Clubs, can even be exchanged for airline miles or to book rental cars.
For some travelers who are especially brand-loyal, timeshares can ensure you’re enjoying your favorite service and amenities.  
“Timeshares can also feel more approachable for younger generations than other potential options such as purchasing a vacation home in one destination or saving for each vacation on a year-by-year basis,” Brian Miller, president of Vacation Ownership, Marriott Vacations Worldwide, told USA TODAY.
Instead of a single fixed week or a floating week, some companies now go by a point-based system. The points work similarly to airline miles in that they can also be banked or used in advance one year into the future. If you still don’t have enough points, you can purchase additional points to lock that dream vacation in. 
The Marriott Vacation Club's timeshare owners can use their points at any traditional Marriott hotel or property within The Marriott Vacation Club's portfolio, which includes over 90 destinations, plus those more unique experiences mentioned above. Hilton Grand Vacation Club and Disney Vacation Club also function on a similar points-based system. 
There's a common notion that timeshares lose value over time and are very difficult to get out of. While timeshares do offer the opportunity to travel each year, they won’t appreciate in value – unlike investing in a vacation home. Plus, there are annual fees, which are usually around $1,000 on average, according to the Resort Development Association. 
The Berns siblings do admit they’re both worried about managing the maintenance fees of their family’s timeshare in the future and are learning closely from their mother how to manage the financial obligations. 
The Marriott Vacation Club offers various ways for owners to get out of their timeshares for whatever reason – but sometimes those come at a fee. The company has a resale program, which offers guidance to help them plan their timeshare exit, Miller said.
If an owner has no outstanding fees or balances, there are fee-less options like a deed back and listing program, where the company will act as the broker on the owner’s behalf. Those broker fees are deducted from closing proceeds, so the owner doesn’t have to pay anything in advance.  
That being said, the resale market for timeshares is competitive and a buyer’s market. 
Other programs, like the Disney Vacation Club, sometimes ask for a first right of refusal for buybacks. 
The structured payment program of a timeshare means you’re locked into paying for a vacation each year, whether or not you take it. If your ability to travel isn’t very flexible and you’re also not committed to annual trips, then a timeshare is probably a bad investment for you.
You’ll also want to make sure you can afford those annual maintenance fees, which can increase over time if the company chooses to do so. 
Not really. Depending on the owner level, there are some benefits you could receive with The Marriott Vacation Club, such as discounts at select restaurants or getting 25% off your points usage.

UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay.
Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports.
Their partnership should have been a force for good. Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.
The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.
Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.
But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.
According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.
“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”
In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”
“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”
Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.
The stakes are high for everyone.
Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.
Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.
Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.
Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.
“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”
USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.
Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.
For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.
Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.
For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.
“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”
Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.
Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.
At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.
By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.
Tucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.
Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline
Tucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.
Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.
Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.
Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.
During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.
They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.
In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”
It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.
Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.
Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.
They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.
Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.
By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.
Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.
Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”
Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.
Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.
Twelve days later came the call.
Tracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.
According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.
“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”
Tracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”
She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.
“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”
Tracy said she thought to herself, "Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it." In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”
When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.
Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.
Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.
At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.
Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.
When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.
Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.
Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”
Tucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.
The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.
Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.
She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.
Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.
“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”
The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.
A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.
Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.
Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.
Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.
Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.
Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.
“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.
Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.
Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.
Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.
Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.
They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.
“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”
Michigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.
The case would go forward.
Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22.
He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.
For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.
Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.
An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.
Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.
During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”
Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.
“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”
Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.
Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.
Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.
Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.
At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.
Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.
Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”
Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.
One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.
A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”
“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”

On a sunny Thursday morning, Michigan State University football coach Mel Tucker strolled through tomato fields at a farm in Immokalee, Florida, toured its processing plants and loaded baskets of bright green fruit into a truck. 
It was a private event thrown by the school to promote its migrant student services program, which provides financial aid and support to farmworkers seeking college degrees. After the April 28, 2022, tour, disclosed in records obtained by USA TODAY this week, Tucker met with community leaders and alumni.
That night, Tucker would make the now-infamous phone call from his hotel room in nearby Naples, during which he is accused of masturbating and making unwanted sexual comments to Brenda Tracy, a prominent rape survivor and activist he had hired to speak to his team about sexual violence.
Yet, when Tucker met with the university’s outside investigator in March for his interview in the sexual harassment case against him, he insisted the trip was not work-related – a claim the investigator would disprove in her report.
It’s just one example of Tucker failing to keep his story straight at the most consequential moment of his career. 
With his job, reputation and the roughly $80 million left on his contract at stake, Tucker repeatedly made false statements to the investigator and misled her about basic facts, such as his location during the phone call and the date it occurred, a USA TODAY review of more than 1,200 pages of case documents found. 
The investigator, Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, and the news organization both obtained documents and witness statements that discredit key aspects of Tucker’s version of events. 
Michigan State suspended Tucker without pay on Sept. 10, hours after Tracy went public for the first time with her story in USA TODAY. On Monday, the school informed Tucker it plans to fire him for cause based on the conduct he had admitted to and the embarrassment he had caused the school. 
Investigation:Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker accused of sexually harassing rape survivor
Although Tucker denied sexually harassing Tracy, he acknowledged masturbating on the call, saying he and Tracy had been in a romantic relationship and had consensual “phone sex.” Tracy said Tucker’s romantic interest in her was completely one-sided and that she had tried to set boundaries multiple times during their yearlong business partnership.
Per his contract, Tucker has until Tuesday to make a case for keeping his job. Regardless, a formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated school policies against sexual harassment and exploitation is expected to proceed on Oct. 5 and 6. 
Since his suspension, Tucker has issued multiple public statements defending himself, attacking Tracy and accusing Veidlinger of bias. He accused the school of conducting a “sham” hearing and having “ulterior motives.” Yet even in these written statements, the central details of his story changed entirely.
Tucker, who previously hung up on a reporter who called him on his cellphone asking about the case, did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. His attorney, Jennifer Belveal, has not responded to phone calls and emails. Tracy declined to comment for this story.
In the absence of eyewitnesses or recordings, sexual harassment cases usually boil down to whose account is more credible, said Elizabeth Abdnour, a Lansing-based attorney and former Michigan State Title IX investigator who has taken part in dozens of campus cases.
“It’s very, very unusual that you would have some outside piece of evidence that would give you a clear decision,” Abdnour said. “Very often you’re weighing credibility based on little bits and pieces of information.” 
In multiple cases she has worked, Abdnour said the respondents lost because they were found to have a greater propensity for lying than the complainants. The hearing officer must determine how much weight to give Tucker’s false and conflicting statements, Abdnour said, and they could sway the case in Tracy’s favor.
“I believe a fact finder could assess these pieces of evidence about credibility and make a determination that Brenda is more credible than Mel,” she said. “In my experience, a clear sign of a lack of credibility is generally taken very seriously.”
By the time Tucker met with Veidlinger for his interview, he had had months to prepare.
The school had informed him of Tracy’s complaint on Dec. 22, the day after she filed it. Veidlinger had interviewed Tracy and all six of her witnesses by the end of January. Tucker was the only holdout.
Rather than tell his side of the story right away, Tucker and his attorney spent three months trying to stop the investigation, case documents show. They wrote legal arguments urging Michigan State to drop the case and twice approached Tracy’s attorney proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no, and the school pressed forward.
On March 22, the day of his interview, Tucker sent Veidlinger a seven-page written account of his interactions with Tracy and lists of their “currently existing” text message and call history, which he said his legal team had compiled. Only a handful of text messages remained; he and Tracy both told the investigator they had deleted their texts with each other in the months after the April 2022 phone call.
In his interview, which lasted 3 ½ hours, Tucker questioned whether Tracy had mixed up the date of the call. He said he recalled being at his home in East Lansing when it occurred, but his own records showed that he had been in Florida on April 28, attending a charity function that was “absolutely not a University-sponsored event.”
His seven-page account told a different story – that he had called her while he was “alone in a hotel room.”
Veidlinger does not appear to have asked Tucker about the discrepancy, based on case documents. But by then she knew what he told her in the interview was untrue: she had already obtained records proving he had not been home in East Lansing.
An expense report he had submitted to the university for reimbursement of his hotel and meals shows Tucker flew to Naples, Florida, to attend a golf fundraiser hosted by The Greg H. Montgomery Jr. Foundation for Ultimate Growth, which raises awareness for suicide prevention. It showed he stayed at the Hilton from April 27 to 29, that the trip’s purpose was “administrative” and that it did not involve personal travel. He had flown there on a donor’s private plane.
The trip is when Tucker toured the farm in Immokalee to help promote Michigan State’s College Assistance Migrant Program. The event was titled “Working to make dreams a reality,” according to an agenda obtained from the university by USA TODAY through a public records request. The agenda features Tucker’s name prominently. Tucker posted photos from the tour on his Twitter account.
That Tucker was on a university-sponsored work trip during the incident was a contributing factor in the university’s determination that it had jurisdiction to investigate, the investigation report shows. 
Tucker’s lists of calls and text messages also were missing an important detail: They did not show any communication with Tracy on April 28. He acknowledged in the interview, however, that he had not reviewed the lists before submitting them and that they may have been incomplete.
Tracy, meanwhile, had already provided Veidlinger with her official cellphone records from Sprint that confirmed the date of their call: April 28.
Tucker and Tracy did not speak in the three months after the April 28 call.
Meanwhile, their assistants were planning Tracy’s third visit to campus – an in-person training with coaches and players scheduled for July 25.
Tucker canceled that training three days before, the investigation report shows. When Tracy spoke to him by phone on Aug. 2 seeking to find out why, she would tell the investigator in her interview that Tucker insinuated he would harm her career if she spoke about his conduct. He never rescheduled her visit, and they never spoke again.
The cancellation became a key focus of the investigator – one of a series of alleged incidents that taken together would meet the definition of sexual harassment, which can include pressuring someone into engaging in sexual behavior for an employment benefit and threatening that rejecting such behavior will carry a negative consequence.
“Reported allegations that a University employee is engaging in misconduct within the vendor-vendee relationship for which they are the decision-maker, and/or impeding in such a services relationship based on a quid-pro-quo sexual harassment allegation, is within a University sponsored program or activity,” Veidlinger wrote in the report, so school policy covered it.
Tucker tried to distance himself from the cancellation in a public statement on Sept. 11, the day after Michigan State suspended him without pay.
“I never cancelled any presentation,” he wrote. “Given a personnel change and scheduling challenges as football season approached, we merely postponed it until January 2023. She chose to file her complaint instead of proceeding with the training.”
But that statement contradicts what he told the investigator. When Veidlinger asked in his March interview if he had a role in canceling Tracy’s visit, Tucker said, “Yes, absolutely I did,” the report shows, and that he did not recall any discussions about rescheduling Tracy for January. Such timing would not make sense, he added, because most of his new players would not yet be on campus. 
Tucker also told the investigator why he canceled the visit, blaming it on a scheduling conflict. He said he had recently hired a mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, who needed to implement his new program on short notice. There was limited time in fall camp, Tucker said, and he didn’t want to “overwhelm” the players. He said he decided to yield the time to Newman.
Veidlinger, however, would later obtain records showing Newman did not meet with the team on July 25, the day of Tracy’s planned visit. He had been meeting with them weekly since June 6, the records showed but held no meetings between July 15 and July 28.
One of Tucker’s assistants, who is a witness in the case, also told the investigator that Tucker asked him via text message to cancel it. He said he was never instructed to reschedule. 
In his interview, Tucker told Veidlinger that his relationship with Tracy frayed after the April 2022 phone call – not because of the incident, but because of information he learned after that caused him not to trust her.
According to Tucker, an associate of his had told him over the summer that Tracy’s assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, had been gossiping about Tucker’s marriage, telling others it was “on the rocks.” Tucker said he was “devastated” because he had confided in Tracy about his marital problems, and he believed she had discussed them with Alvarado.
Tucker confronted Tracy about the alleged gossiping during the Aug. 2 phone call, they both told the investigator. Tracy said he berated and bullied her, repeatedly saying he could not trust her. She said she told him she did not know what he was talking about.
Alvarado – who was killed in a car crash in June – would deny discussing Tucker’s marriage with anyone in her January interview with Veidlinger. 
During the Aug. 2 call, Tracy said she pressed Tucker to identify his source – the associate. She told Veidlinger she believed Tucker had made it up as a pretext for canceling her visit and ending her relationship with the school.
Veidlinger also asked Tucker to reveal the source of his claim, but he refused to say. In her report, she wrote that he said he had “given (his) word that (he) wouldn’t divulge their name.” 
Tucker never revealed the associate’s name to the investigator, nor did he identify anyone who could support his version of events. In his Sept. 11 public statement, however, he lamented that the hearing would not afford him the opportunity to “offer any substantive evidence of innocence.”
It was not the only claim he attributed to his anonymous associate. In his interview, he said that same person told him that ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating how Tracy “goes about her business” by claiming to be a rape survivor.  
Tucker said this further caused him to believe Tracy was untrustworthy because she believed Lavigne was her friend but didn’t know she was investigating the rape story at the center of her public persona. 
It turned out to be yet another falsehood.
Reached by USA TODAY, Lavigne said in an emailed statement that she was “perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.” She said Tracy has been a source of information for her for several years, and that she has featured Tracy’s comments and advocacy work in multiple news stories.
“That has been the extent of my reporting on Tracy and her organization,” Lavigne wrote. “Neither the organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting.”
Asked who might have told Tucker this misinformation, Lavigne responded, “I have absolutely no idea who would have alleged this to anyone.”

The bullets came in plywood crates. 
Any given box was about the size of a small microwave oven. The printed label stuck to each one demonstrated a militaristic brevity. “CARTRIDGES FOR WEAPONS, INERT PROJECTILE,” next to a bright yellow hazmat sticker, “EXPLOSIVES.” 
Inside the boxes: drab green steel cans of .50-caliber ammunition. Each round was giant, more than 5 inches long, built to be fired from a gun so big it is typically bolted to a truck. The bullets were clipped together in long strands for rapid, machine-gun fire. 
By the time Bill Brown got to the boxes, they sat double-stacked eight high atop wooden pallets inside a Missouri warehouse. The pallets went on, row after row. Three million bullets in all. 
It was enough ammunition to feed a single machine gun – if fired nonstop at its rated speed eight hours a day, seven days a week – for almost six months. 
Brown’s job was to get it out of there and toward the Ukrainian front lines. The faster, the better. 
“War is bad,” Brown said. “Loss of life is bad. But at the end of the day, it’s very profitable and injects revenue into this military industrial base.”
There would be virtually no public record of this Ukrainian arms shipment. As a weapons dealer, Brown’s company would deliver the bullets under a system known as a direct commercial sale. The ammunition required a State Department signoff – but the secret deal would never appear in a White House announcement or the Congressional Record. 
Instead, it was part of a shadowy system of brokers, exporters, arms dealers and country-to-country transfers that has become one part of the race to meet demand on distant battlefields. 
Western weaponry fueled Ukraine’s summertime counteroffensive along a 600-mile front. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the effort was delayed in part by the wait for more arms. Amid concerns about that slowly progessing counteroffensive, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday with a promise of up to $175 million more in military equipment. 
Most of America’s $44 billion in documented support to Ukraine came in the form of old U.S. military stock, donated directly by the federal government. In general, commercial sales over $14 million, and sales of military-grade weaponry like mortars or missiles, require State Department approval and congressional notification.
But other aid comes via private sales. 
More than 14,000 U.S. entities are registered to conduct defense trade activities. Their deals are monitored by an alphabet soup of agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Trade secrecy clauses in federal law mean this flow of gear, weapons and ammunition is almost never revealed to the public.
Brown, who works for a small Nevada-based logistics company called Battle Born Munitions, provided USA TODAY with a rare look behind the curtain of these private sales. Details about the shipment were verified by his employer and the European government that made the purchase. State Department officials declined to answer questions about the specific shipment Brown described.
This March sale and the secret number of other shipments like it fuel Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion. Those sales also release an unknown amount of weaponry into the world. What becomes of that weaponry after it’s sold – and especially after it’s delivered – is difficult to track. 
As Brown surveyed the warehouse in Missouri, a crew steered forklifts and skid lifts among the stacks of plain wooden boxes. From high in the trusses, suspended lamp fixtures bathed the boxes in artificial daylight. Brown lifted his camera and started snapping photos. 
In just a few hours, he and his cargo would be boarding a jumbo jet. Three million bullets would climb to the stratosphere and hurtle across the north Atlantic toward a European dawn.
From Ukraine:War crimes in Ukraine may be unprecedented. So is the country's push for swift justice.
The bullets had once been bound for Saudi Arabia. 
Lot number SMQ19K401L026 had rolled off the assembly line in 2019 at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant near Kansas City. Lake City, owned by the government and run by a contractor, sprawls across nearly 4,000 acres of green Missouri farmland. Roads curve past World War II-era bunkers known as igloos, spaced out amid the countryside – far enough apart that an explosion in one won’t trigger a chain reaction in the others.
Lake City has been pumping out ammunition almost without pause since 1941. It is the largest small-arms manufacturing plant in the world.
Today the plant is run by Olin-Winchester, but in 2019, the bullets were made by some of the 1,700 workers employed by Northrop Grumman. And in 2019, Saudi Arabia was stocking up on weapons during the Trump administration, fueling the war in Yemen and other conflicts that drew criticism from congressional Democrats.
The plant manufactures .50-caliber ammunition on a rolling basis, for both military and commercial buyers. That’s a testament to just what a legend the bullet – and the gun that shoots it – has become.
In 2019, the technology was already a century old. The .50 caliber was the brainchild of American gunsmith John Browning during World War I. Built to respond to German anti-tank rifles, the M2 was first tested in 1918, and it entered widespread service in 1923. It earned the nickname “Ma Deuce” and has served in combat ever since, bolted to trucks, ships, planes and handheld stands on the battlefield.
The .50-caliber rounds – named for their diameter, about half an inch – can easily hit targets more than a mile away. At closer ranges, they will blast through solid concrete or armored vehicles. The gun can fire at a sustained rate of about 40 shots per minute.
Military setups use strings of “linked” ammunition to feed into machine guns. Spaced out after every fourth bullet, so-called tracer rounds have small pyrotechnic charges that illuminate the line of fire, aiding in targeting.
The gun’s longevity and versatility made it popular for militaries the world over. But this particular batch of bullets wouldn’t end up being sold to Saudi Arabia. 
The Biden administration put a temporary freeze on sales to the Saudi government in 2021 as it reviewed weapons deals approved under Donald Trump. Instead, Brown said, the bullets were sold to a U.S. ammunition provider, only to be held up again. Ultimately, they were mothballed. 
Then, in spring 2023, the bullets found a buyer, or actually two: first Battle Born; ultimately, the Netherlands. 
The European country, a NATO ally, needed a big supply of ammunition. It wouldn’t be keeping the bullets but giving them to Ukraine. Its purchase, essentially a donation, would count toward the country’s required NATO contribution. 
Brown had a line on exactly what they needed. It was sitting in the warehouse in Missouri. 
He arrived in March to personally oversee the shipment. As he prepped for delivery, Brown dropped tiny black tracking devices onto several of the pallets. Just $55 apiece, the units use GPS and cell signals to keep tabs on the load. The idea was to ensure it wouldn’t fall into the wrong hands. 
But packing up the bullets was just the beginning. As with anything that’s deadly and made of metal, the shipping costs can be extreme. 
Brown said the question for the buyer was simple: “How fast do you want it? Forty-five to 60 days on a ship? Or in five days if I fly it?”
Brown – or Chief Bill, as he prefers – is a no-nonsense 35-year veteran of the U.S. Army and former helicopter pilot. He retired as a chief warrant officer and lives in Orlando. 
Now 59, he still spends a lot of time on the road – 10 international trips this year. He says his arms logistics work takes him to places most Americans would rather avoid – near the Syrian border or to unstable regions of Iraq.
He’ll travel halfway around the world, he quips, “have some soup, and go back to Warsaw to head home.” The trips aren’t really about the destinations. They’re about the cargo. 
On that spring day in Missouri, forklifts carefully loaded 107 pallets of the ammo onto 18 flatbed semitrailers. They’d all make the eight-hour drive to O’Hare International Airport. 
In Chicago, two Boeing 747-400s operated by National Airlines would be ready for the freight. 
Four pallets each were stacked and shrink-wrapped to create “air pallets” or “cookie sheets” weighing 12,800 pounds. Each plane could carry up to 17 of the pallets that ran the length of each plane secured by white cargo netting.
Flight records Brown provided show the two planes departed about seven hours apart, one in early afternoon, one after dark. 
The flight would take nine hours. Brown wasn’t going to the Netherlands, even though it was the buyer. The planes were bound for Rzeszów, Poland. 
The ancient city sits at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in southeastern Poland. It has a gleaming modern airport next to a major east-west freeway. From there, it’s barely 60 miles to the border with Ukraine. 
It was an expensive journey. The trucking company’s bill for those 18 semis? $85,000. Chartering the two 747s? $625,000. Each.
But this shipment of .50-cal rounds was profitable for Battle Born Munitions, according to Brown.
The company purchased the 3 million rounds from Northrop Grumman at a bargain and resold them for more than double the price. (In subsequent interviews, representatives at BBM disputed the specific totals Brown mentioned, saying the accurate figures were protected by “various commercial and government non-disclosure agreements.” They did not dispute the other specifics of the deal he provided.) 
Retail prices for .50-caliber ammunition run roughly $5 per bullet. At that rate, the whole shipment would have been worth $15 million.
The pricing might also be elastic. The Dutch mark up the price of the bullets and count it toward their NATO contribution, pegged to a percentage of gross domestic product, Brown said. The Netherlands has contributed about $15 billion to NATO this year, or about 1.7% of its GDP and just under the NATO mandate of 2%.
Representatives of the Dutch military confirmed the shipment to USA TODAY but declined to comment further about the pricing or details.
The war in Ukraine has only increased the demand for private deals. The State Department signed off on more than $154 billion in commercial arms deals directly to foreign countries in 2022, a 48% increase from the previous year. 
Direct commercial sales represent a modest portion of the contribution to Ukraine compared with the $44 billion donated by the U.S., but they still amounted to more than $600 million in sales from U.S. companies to the Ukrainian government last year alone. That doesn’t include sales to other countries that also support Ukraine – sales like the one Brown described.
Jim Bartlett, an attorney with expertise in the specialized international arms transactions, said private U.S. businesses are playing a small but important role in the conflict.
“American companies are happy to export defense articles to foreign buyers approved by the U.S. State Department,” Bartlett said. “There’s an effort at the State Department to quickly clear the ones headed for Ukraine. … You get head-of-the-line privileges.”
Those sales also come with risks. 
Direct sales face fewer regulatory controls, oversight and enforcement, said Robert Nichols, an international military sales expert and attorney at the law firm Nichols Liu.
“You can imagine the range of characters involved in supplying a war effort,” Nichols said. “Some are highly credible. Others will skirt the law and sometimes step over the line by paying bribes, committing fraud and hiding their transactions.” 
So far, the Department of Justice has indicted just a handful of arms brokers over deals related to the war in Ukraine. Court records show the government has charged Miami-based Oleg Patsulya and Vasilii Besedin with illegally attempting to sell American-made aircraft parts to Russia. They allegedly lied to Commerce Department agents and told them the parts were bound for Turkey. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges this summer. 
A State Department spokesman declined to provide details of enforcement actions but said, “The United States takes seriously our responsibility to protect American military and dual-use technologies and prevent their diversion, including through strong enforcement actions.”
NATO said it oversees allied arms deliveries, and that those arms generally reach Ukraine. NATO itself technically only provides non-non-lethal aid, like fuel, medical supplies and generators.
Brown, of Battle Born, says he fields calls weekly from “clowns” without the proper licensing, whom he reports to the State Department for potential violations. Some raise red flags when they approach him about transactions that include payment via diamonds or gold.
He prefers traditional wire transfers with approved sales partners since he knows government officials are watching. He validates the contracts and checks certificates for the final users. That’s part of why he traveled with the ammunition. He would be meeting a Dutch military official for the official handoff.
“My job is to keep us all out of jail,” Brown said. 
The two 747s touched down in Poland, one before the sun, the other in late morning. Brown exchanged paperwork with a young Dutch military staffer who signed for the delivery, he said. They traded military patches as souvenirs. They snapped a photo together. 
The bullets bought by the Netherlands would never touch Dutch soil. 
U.S. aid:Billions from the US flows to Ukraine. Here's where it comes from, and how it adds up
Despite playing a small role proportionately in the war, $600 million in direct commercial sales can buy a lot of small weaponry. 
And those weapons are the kind most apt to fall into illicit use, said Elias Yousif, a research analyst at the Stimson Center, a nonprofit think tank.
Put another way: It’s hard to sneak away an F-16 or a missile launcher the size of a tractor-trailer. But a bunch of guns or a pallet of ammo? Much easier to resell. 
“In the commercial sector, especially in a new market, the risk increases,” Yousif said.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss arms research project, estimated that within a year, battlefield seizures and other forms of diversion led to 300,000 small arms and light weapons going missing, including 100,000 in Crimea alone.
When small arms go missing, they can go missing into another country, maybe one led by a despot or even a terrorist organization.
The U.S. government says diversion of American donations has been widely absent so far in Ukraine. That could be a combination of intensive “end-use-monitoring” programs and the reality of the battlefield, where supplies are rapidly put to use.
But even if not now, unused ammo could be resold someday. 
“History shows us this isn’t a short-term issue,” Yousif said.  “These are commodities with very long shelf lives.” 
Florida-based Global Ordnance, another State Department-licensed exporter, is a competitor in the direct weapons sales business. General counsel Bryan Van Brunt said the company has extensive protocols in place to track shipments and make sure the end-users are federally approved, though he declined to provide specifics about those systems. 
Brown, with Battle Born Munitions, says the company employs a mix of simple and sophisticated tracking technology to ensure his shipments are tracked to end users. The black GPS devices he dropped onto his cargo tracked the ammo all the way across the globe.
But that system only works as long as Brown is actually tracking. “Technically, my role ends when I deliver it to NATO,” he said.
Sometime after the 747s touched down in Poland, along with signing the paperwork and snapping a selfie with the Dutch official, Brown found the tiny black GPS trackers and lifted them off the pallets. 
Ukrainian trucks would arrive at the airport to pick up the ammunition. They would point toward the border, and onward to Lviv, and some distant battlefield. 
Brown would point in the opposite direction. Just like one of his quips: Fly in, have soup, get home. He headed toward Warsaw, with the GPS trackers in his bag.

The geography professor didn’t hide his clown fetish or the fact that he sometimes indulged his urges by recruiting students as subjects. He posted regularly about it on social media.
“I have a facepaint fetish and convince the cute girls in my classes to let me paint their faces,” he once wrote.
Yet Joseph Tokosh held jobs at two colleges and was on the tenure track at a third before student journalists at Nicholls State University in Louisiana exposed his behavior. He submitted his resignation the same day their story was published.
His interactions with students and open discussion of his fetish happened in both mainstream and tailored digital spaces. He popped into Facebook groups geared toward new students and niche forums on websites like Reddit. He posted videos on YouTube. In one Reddit post on a forum meant to highlight hard-to-believe stories, Tokosh posted pictures of several women in white face paint.
Over the years, two students reported him to campus police; others complained online. He left Kent State University after pleading no contest to something different: a theft charge that involved entering his peers’ offices without permission and taking a USB drive. Tokosh has not been charged with any other crime.
Tokosh’s career trajectory exposes inadequacies in the background check system that colleges and universities are supposed to have in place to protect students – especially when evidence of the concerning behavior resides largely on the internet. Nicholls State, for example, told USA TODAY Network reporters it does not routinely check social media for new hires.
A federal law intended to ensure the academic privacy of students also makes it difficult to determine how Tokosh was able to move so freely from campus to campus. Both Kent State and Northern Illinois University – where he taught while finishing his doctorate – noted Tokosh’s protected status as a graduate student in declining to answer questions.
Sophie Levan was a freshman at Kent State in 2017 when she encountered Tokosh, then 28, in a Facebook group intended as a gathering place for new students. Tokosh had offered cash to anyone willing to let him paint their faces. Levan, then 18, agreed.
The money was appealing but the interactions soured. 
Tokosh, she said, insisted he come pick her up and take her to the building that housed the geography department, where he would paint her face. Uneasy, Levan stopped responding. Tokosh got angry and wouldn’t give up, she said, which led her to file a police report.
“I felt like the school would want to know about it,” Levan said. “I thought maybe they could prevent anything bad from happening since other girls would go with him.”
She said there was never any followup from campus police – or anyone else.
USA TODAY Network reporters reviewed the experiences of six students who were the subject of Tokosh’s attention going back to his time at Kent State.
In addition to Levan, the other person who reported Tokosh to campus police could not be reached for comment. The two who expressed public concerns on social media told USA TODAY they never heard from their campus officials either.
USA TODAY attempted to reach Tokosh via phone, social media and a certified letter. A person answered a phone call to a number associated with Tokosh, but he hung up after the reporter identified himself. A reporter also reached someone who identified herself as Tokosh’s mother. She said she would pass along that reporters were trying to reach him.
Tokosh told the Nicholls student journalists that he did have an assignment where students were required to paint their faces as part of a cultural exercise. Prior to the article in the student newspaper The Nicholls Worth, the university had already cut Tokosh loose. He said his contract was not renewed because he was the target of a “grade inflation task force.”
The university, however, “does not have any such task force,” according to Nicholls spokesman Jerad David.
Tokosh also told students the face painting was a requirement in his cultural geography class to better understand other cultures. In a video interview with Hannah Robert, the station manager for the student-run KNSU TV, he says: “That's an assignment in one of my classes where they actually come up with their own face paint and makeup design inspired by a culture and they implement it.”
It’s a well-established trend in the academic world for professors to bounce from one institution to another without having to disclose why they left their last post, said Julie Libarkin, an associate dean at Michigan State University. She has seen the pattern often in her work maintaining a database of publicly documented sexual misconduct by faculty and staff.
As for grad students? Libarkin said people have requested she add them to her list, but universities’ conservative interpretations of the law get in the way.
“I don’t on purpose,” she said, “because that’s information that almost never comes out.”
Tokosh arrived at Kent State in 2015 with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in geography from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, according to his curriculum vitae. He was working toward his doctorate and researched fading businesses. His work about shopping malls in the Rust Belt won several awards. Like many graduate students, he also taught classes.
Then, Tokosh started showing up in the Facebook groups for new students. In a December 2017 post, an account under the name “Joe Tokosh” posted several pictures of women made up to look like clowns or skulls.
“If anyone is looking for some extra cash, I am looking for people to practice facepainting on!” he wrote. “I will literally pay you!”
Those are the types of posts that caught Levan’s eye. Not only was she pressed for cash, she was interested in movie makeup and thought the face painting could be fun based on the photos Tokosh had posted. But Levan said she soon realized that those images were stock photos and not representative of what Tokosh could do.
What’s more, she figured out that he was a graduate student, a fact she said he didn’t disclose in his posts.
When Tokosh offered to pick her up from her dorm, she refused. But, she said, Tokosh kept insisting she agreed to participate. Levan stopped responding to his messages and filed a police report with the Kent State police in January 2018. They advised her only to stop talking to Tokosh, she said, and let them know if “anything of consequence occurred.”
Months after she refused to meet up and filed the police report, Tokosh texted a picture of himself wearing white face paint to her cellphone. It arrived at midnight and contained no message, although writing on his shirt read: “I'm not a failure.”  
“There was some negative intention with sending that photo,” Levan said. “It’s definitely burned into my mind.”
What Levan didn’t know is that campus police had been put on notice a year earlier when another student filed a similar report. That student told police Tokosh reached out to her and her friends after they posted their numbers on a Facebook group for undergraduates. He would send “get to know you” messages, the police report said, and then ask the student if she was “interested in having her face painted for one of his class projects.”
When she found out Tokosh was a graduate student, she said no and eventually blocked him on Facebook and Snapchat, according to the report. Tokosh continued to text her.
“She does not have any concerns for her safety, but just wanted this documented,” the police report read. 
In July 2017, another student had retweeted a message from Kent State’s Twitter account that asked for Kent State love stories. She wrote: “A geography professor requested me on facebook and asked if he could paint my face like a clown.”
The student confirmed to USA TODAY that the professor was Tokosh and shared a screenshot of a Facebook friend request he sent her. She said she suspected Tokosh also found her on a freshman Facebook group because she posted there often.
She said she tweeted to draw officials’ attention to it and moved on but now wishes she had reported it officially.
College campuses are supposed to offer students special protections from sexual harassment even when it falls short of criminal behavior. Title IX, often associated with equity in women’s sports, also addresses “sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence” at schools that receive federal funding.
Colleges infrequently and unevenly enforce the rule, however. A 2022 USA TODAY investigation found just one of every 12,400 students was suspended in connection with sexual misconduct.
The student who shared her story online said the only response she received was from a graduate student in the geography department, who contacted her on Oct. 1, 2018. In an email, he wrote that he had seen her post and suspected he knew which faculty member had asked her about face painting.
“I brought it to the attention of some of our faculty because I was pretty sure I knew who it was, but they were certain it wasn’t that individual and that you probably just meant geology,” he wrote. 
He went on to reference another student being “approached in (at least by just looking at your tweet) a much more aggressive way.” The grad student asked the undergraduate for more information, but, she told USA TODAY, she didn’t respond. She said she started drafting a reply, but a year had passed. She wanted to move on.
Kent State would not say whether any actions were taken after the students’ reports, but Eric Mansfield, a spokesman for the university, said the police department confirmed that the students who filed police reports were provided with “university resources, which would include other non-criminal avenues to pursue (Counseling Services, Title IX, Center for Sexual and Relationship Violence Services, etc.) as a general police practice.”
Levan does not recall police offering her services, but she said she didn’t want counseling. She wanted Tokosh investigated.
Mansfield also said that the university monitors social media but that colleges “can’t always see or track every mention on social media.”
Police records show that officers did investigate when Tokosh was accused of breaking into geography department offices. A blotter item in the local newspaper shows police obtained an arrest warrant in connection with a third-degree felony burglary charge. Court documents indicate Tokosh pleaded no contest to a theft on Oct. 19, 2018.
Kent State would not explain what led to Tokosh’s departure during that fall semester. Instead, the university said that since Tokosh was a graduate student, any information about him was protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It also would not say whether school officials shared Tokosh’s disciplinary record with other colleges or even if it was standard practice to do so for grad students.
“Due to FERPA, student education records are private,” said Emily Vincent, a university spokeswoman. “Also, we do not comment on personnel matters.”
When Congress passed FERPA in 1974, its author, Sen. James L. Buckley of New York, said the intent was to protect the academic privacy of students and their families. In more recent years, Buckley has become critical of the law and how schools interpret it. He told the Columbus Dispatch in 2010 that “the law needs to be revamped.”
Survivors of sexual violence and students accuse universities of using the law to avoid negative media coverage. Students with a history of bad behavior may jump from one school to another without the public ever knowing about their histories. Law enforcement records don’t fall under FERPA’s purview, but a wide variety of questionable behavior does.
One case involved Brandon Austin, who was accused of sexual assault at Providence College in 2013 while on the school’s basketball team. But Providence College initially said Austin was suspended for violating the school’s code of student conduct and declined to share further details with the Providence Journal, citing federal privacy laws. Austin denied wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime. 
Austin was able to transfer to the University of Oregon, where he was again accused of sexual assault, along with other players. Police investigated the claims, and the local district attorney declined to press charges. The university expelled him anyway but raised FERPA when it declined to release records showing what Oregon knew about the allegations, according to the Oregonian.
LeRoy Rooker was the director of the U.S. Education Department office that oversaw FERPA for more than two decades. Rooker, now a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said FERPA is not a confidentiality law – it is focused on education records. And it doesn’t apply when a student is “seeking or intending to enroll” at another college.
Therefore, Rooker said, Kent State could have shared information about Tokosh with Northern Illinois.
Rooker also said FERPA would not have prevented Kent State from telling reporters if other universities had inquired about Tokosh, though they could not have disclosed what they shared.
He blamed the overuse of the law on fear of being sued.
“In this litigious age, institutions get a little wonky about whether they will forward, say, disciplinary records,” Rooker said. “On the other hand, if you have something and you don’t share it when you can and something happens at the next institution, I would say that’s a big liability.”
Backgrounding job applicants has become increasingly complex.
While most U.S. employers conduct background screening, according to trade group data, those inquiries typically focus on criminal history. Social media receives far less attention even though that is where people are most likely to share their unguarded thoughts.
Undertaking a full review of a person’s social media presence is more difficult than just checking an applicant’s Facebook page.
Does an applicant have an account on X, formerly Twitter? How about an account with Discord, an online platform frequented by gamers, where leaked Pentagon documents were recently shared? Or what about a Telegram account, a messaging platform popular among white nationalists? Further complicating things, it’s common on sites like Reddit for users to adopt usernames and describe experiences with little to no ties to reality.
A little digging, however, can turn up a lot of dirt.  
Tokosh has a LinkedIn page that includes his teaching stints at Northern Illinois University and Nicholls State University. His time as a student and instructor at Kent State is absent.
For LinkedIn, a custom URL includes a play on his name and his chosen field of study: Joeography. Tokosh would later use that moniker in promotional materials for a class at Nicholls State. That is the same handle used on Reddit by someone with a special interest in face paint.
One post features a video of Tokosh throwing a pie at someone. Other posts mention a “clown fetish.” In a forum titled “Creepy,” he wrote, “I convince pretty girls to let me paint their faces,” along with a photo with multiple women in white face paint.
That and other similar posts remained live for years until they were taken down after the Nicholls students published their story in late March.
USA TODAY Network reporters captured screenshots before they disappeared. With dates in 2019, the posts feature a young woman wearing a Kent State T-shirt. The material would have been available to administrators at Northern Illinois before the start of the fall 2019 semester.
Joe King, a spokesman for Northern Illinois, said departments hiring new graduate students are “not required to check social media or investigate a disciplinary history.” He added some departments may reach out to the graduate students’ former advisers.
King said he could not determine if the university was aware of Tokosh’s behavior at Kent State. He said that due to FERPA, he could not share specifics about Tokosh’s time at Northern Illinois, including whether students had complained about him.
But there are signs the behavior continued.
A YouTube account under the name “Joe Tokosh” included at least two videos in 2020 of a man throwing pies at women. One of the videos features a young woman also seen in the screenshots from Tokosh’s Reddit account. 
Comments on one from October 2020 read: “You can have a video of her tied up getting pied via cash app.” That video was viewed more than 30,000 times before it was turned off in late July, around the time a USA TODAY reporter reached out to Tokosh.
A former Northern Illinois State student shared text messages exchanged with Tokosh in which he asked to paint her face on multiple occasions. USA TODAY has agreed not to name her because she is concerned Tokosh might retaliate against her.
In the text messages, Tokosh shared a photo of a young woman in white face paint – an image also posted to the Joeography Reddit account. She said she declined to do it but was aware that other Northern Illinois students had participated.
By fall 2022, when he had moved on to Nicholls, Tokosh revealed to the student that he had required students in his cultural geography class to paint their faces.  
The Northern Illinois student asked Tokosh what he did with the photos, and she said he suggested that he might spin them off into a research project someday. She asked, had anyone complained? She said Tokosh responded: Why would they?
Many students would find a reason to complain, as Nicholls State student journalist Sally-Anne Torres learned firsthand. It started in January when one of her fellow reporters picked up an odd rumor: a professor was offering extra credit for students willing to paint their faces like clowns. Initially, Torres dismissed it because it seemed too unusual and there weren’t a lot of leads to follow. 
By Feb. 7, university administrators informed Tokosh that his contract would not be renewed, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY via a records request. They gave no reason for the nonrenewal, but on Feb. 12, Tokosh emailed his students that the university was letting him go. He blamed his departure on giving too many A’s.
That seemed suspicious to Torres. 
During her reporting, she received a tip about Tokosh’s Reddit posts in which he wrote of his “clown fetish” and how he enlisted his students to participate in it.
“It wasn’t just this innocent thing that a lot of these girls thought it was,” Torres said. “As a professor or teacher, that is somebody students are supposed to trust. He used his power to ruin that trust and to do these things, and that made me angry for them.”
Torres spoke to six students who shared their experiences with Tokosh. Some, she said, were followed on Twitter by him while others opted into an extra credit assignment he offered.
The women told Torres he sometimes giggled and laughed as they painted their faces in his office.
On March 27, the Nicholls Worth published a story headlined, “Geography professor suspended immediately, students allege sexual harassment.” KNSU TV, a student broadcast network, also aired footage in which Tokosh defended the assignment on camera. That same day, Tokosh submitted his resignation.
The story’s publication prompted other students to come forward about Tokosh and their frustration with the university.
Bradley Price took an online class with Tokosh and said the professor required students to photograph themselves with their faces painted. Price said Tokosh told them the assignment was to help them understand Japanese culture, but then Tokosh offered him bonus points if he could get a female friend to paint her face.
It seemed unusual at the time, Price said, because his friend wasn’t in the class. It became more concerning to him on reading the student newspaper’s report.
“I feel frankly disgusted and disappointed that Nicholls couldn’t do a proper background check on this professor, because this is unacceptable,” Price said. 
Bella Ramos, a junior at Nicholls State who did not take any of Tokosh’s classes, told USA TODAY that someone using the handle @Joeography21 followed her on Twitter in late 2021 and started liking all her selfies.
Ramos learned that the person behind the account was likely a professor at the university. She posted about the behavior in January 2022, but nothing came of it. She also found the Joeography Reddit account. On March 27, the same day the student newspaper published its piece, Ramos posted screenshots of her discoveries on Twitter with the message, “Found a Nicholls state university professor on Reddit.”
“I wish the university had acted sooner because all this information was public on the internet,” she told USA TODAY. 
No one from the university, she said, has ever reached out.

An Oct. 11 Facebook post (direct link, archive link) shows a photo of Qatar's head of state along with a warning he supposedly made about his country’s energy exports.
“The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, has threatened that if the bombing of Gaza does not stop, he will cut off the supply of gas to the world,” reads both the caption and the text in the post.
The post was shared more than 60 times in five days.

A disinformation expert in Qatar says the emir has not made such a threat, and there are no credible reports of one.
The claim is “100% false,” a Qatar-based expert on Middle Eastern studies and disinformation campaigns told USA TODAY.
“The emir has not said anything of the sort,” Marc Owen Jones, an associate professor at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Doha, the capital of Qatar, said in an email.
Qatar was the world’s third-largest liquefied natural gas exporter during the first half of 2023, behind the U.S. and Australia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Fact check: False claim that Qatar rejected German plane for LGBTQ symbol
So a legitimate threat that one of its leaders would shut off its natural gas valve certainly would have made global headlines. But no credible news outlets have reported it.
In fact, on the same day the post was made, France said it would buy up to 3.5 million tons of liquefied natural gas from Qatar each year through 2050. A day later, the emir visited Germany – which last year said it would import up to 2 million tons each year – amid criticism of Qatar’s ties to the Palestinian militant group Hamas, Politico reported.
Hamas’ attack on southern Israeli towns near the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7 led to the start of its latest war with Israel. The conflict has left more than 4,000 dead on both sides, including 30 Americans, as of Oct. 16.
Qatar is seen as being a major sponsor of Hamas, Politico reported, but Qatari officials deny that, saying aid for Gaza is intended to improve life for Palestinians.
Any threat about withholding gas was not discussed during a joint news conference held Oct. 13 by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the Qatari prime minister.
The claim originated in an Oct. 11 post on X from an account purporting to cover Qatari affairs, but it attributed the threat to the state of Qatar, not the emir. The account has since been suspended. It is not an official channel, and Jones said another version of the account was suspended previously.
USA TODAY reached out to both the Qatar embassy in Washington and the emir but did not immediately receive responses from either.
Qatar vowed in 2017 to not cut the gas supply to the United Arab Emirates even as that nation and others in the region severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and accused it of harboring terrorists, charges it has repeatedly denied. The CEO of state-run Qatar Petroleum, Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, said the country would not halt supplies “to its brothers,” Al Jazeera reported at the time.
During that diplomatic crisis, which lasted until 2021 and included a blockade, a number of accounts also appeared on the platform and spread misinformation about Qatar, Jones said.
USA TODAY reached out to the social media user who shared the post but did not immediately receive a response.

An Oct. 10 Facebook post (direct link, archive link) claims an Israeli government official made a stark comment amid the Israel-Hamas war. 
“Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant: ‘The Israeli army is launching a full-scale offensive on the Gaza Strip,’” reads the post. “We have abolished all the rules of war. Our soldiers will not be held accountable for anything. There will be no military courts.” 
It was shared more than 40 times in four days. Other versions of the claim accumulated thousands of additional shares across Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter.

There is no evidence Gallant said this. Versions of the claim reference Gallant's message to Israeli troops along the Gaza border, but media accounts of those remarks include no mention of abolishing the rules of war.
Some versions of the claim include a lengthier quotation attributed to Gallant. It says Israel is “moving to a full offense” and “Hamas wanted a change in Gaza, it will change 180 degrees from what it thought.” 
Those comments roughly match Gallant’s message to troops along the Gaza border on Oct. 10, as reported by the Times of Israel. He says:
There is no reference to Israel abandoning the rules of war in the remarks. Though some versions of the claim attributed the supposed quote to Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik, there is no such quotation in any of the outlet’s articles on Gallant.

Both Israel and Hamas have been criticized for possible violations of the rules of war, including killing civilians and taking them as hostages, Reuters reported. Israel has also been criticized for preventing food, water, medicine and fuel from entering Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. 
A United Nations commission said it has been “collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes committed by all sides,” the Associated Press reported. 
President Joe Biden has also urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to observe the rules of war in retaliating against Hamas, according to outlets including CNN, the Hill and PBS. 
USA TODAY has debunked an array of false claims about the Israel-Hamas war, including that a video showed Russian President Vladimir Putin warning the U.S. to not interfere in the conflict, that the Department of Defense evacuated the U.S. embassy in Beirut and told Americans to leave Lebanon immediately and that a video shows Israel fabricating a child’s injuries. 
USA TODAY reached out to several users who shared the post for comment but did not immediately receive a response.
Lead Stories also debunked the claim.

Hi there OnPolitics readers! Last week, voters questioned five Republican presidential candidates in a series of town halls in Exeter, New Hampshire, hosted by Seacoastonline and the USA TODAY Network.
🎤 Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former Vice President Mike Pence and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy all spoke at the historic Exeter Town Hall, but it was clear Granite State voters weren’t going to let the candidates get away with simply delivering their stump speech.
Instead, voters made their priorities – and worries – clear, pressing 2024 White House hopefuls on their vision for the nation, USA TODAY’s Phillip M. Bailey reports:
⏰ Climate change, social security and concerns for the future: Those who showed up to speak with the candidates face-to-face wanted answers on how they would tackle America's long-term problems.
🐘 Compassionate conservatism: The candidates repeatedly emphasized how the voters who aren't paying attention yet want a solutions-oriented leader seeking common ground in 2024, not a bombastic style.
❌ Haley and Ramaswamy's contrasts pack the house: Haley and Ramaswamy's forums had standing room only attendance, which could indicate they're on a collision course in the Granite State.
🤝 Pence praised after the Capitol attack: Voters told Pence that they wanted to specifically thank him for refusing to cave amid pressure from former President Donald Trump and threats from supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
🎁 Voters are skeptical about moving on from Trump: Many voters who attended the forums this past week, said they fear former President Donald Trump has the primary wrapped up.

An Oct. 7 video (direct link, archive link) on X, formerly Twitter, shows a tall building collapsing to the ground following multiple explosions.
"Moment Israel launched Operation Iron Swords," reads the video's caption. "Israel destroyed third Gaza tower eliminated (sic) Palestinian Terrorists."
The video was reposted more than 100 times and shared more than 20 times on Facebook in six days, according to CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool.

The video is miscaptioned. It shows an Israeli airstrike that destroyed a building in Gaza in May 2021.
Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, launched a deadly surprise attack against Israel on the morning of Oct. 7. Israel responded with what is being called Operation "Swords of Iron," with devastating airstrikes against Gaza, which is home to about 2.3 million people. At least 4,000 people have died on both sides as of Oct. 16, with thousands more wounded.
The X video, though, doesn't show a recent Israeli airstrike. The same video was posted on X by Al Jazeera on May 13, 2021, with a caption that reads, "This is the moment the 14-story al-Shorouq tower, housing media offices in Gaza City, was completely destroyed by multiple Israeli air raids on Wednesday."
Other videos posted online around that time show the same building being destroyed.
A video from CNN shows the building crumbling to the ground and includes a caption that reads, "This is the third high-rise building to be destroyed by the (Israel Defense Forces) since the escalation of the violence began on May 10, 2021."
Fact check: Old Israel rocket attack video miscaptioned; predates current Hamas conflict
ABC News also shared a similar video in an X post on May 13, 2021, saying it "shows the moment an Israeli airstrike hit and leveled the 14-story Al-Shorouk Tower in Gaza amid an escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas."
The fighting broke out when Hamas militants in Gaza fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem on May 10, 2021, the Associated Press reported. The conflict followed days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.
A cease-fire agreement eventually brought the 11-day war to an end, but not before more than 200 people were killed in the fighting.

If government regulators prevail against Google in the biggest U.S. antitrust trial in a quarter century, it's likely to unleash drastic changes that will undermine the dominance of a search engine that defines the internet for billions of people.
As the 10-week trial probing Google's business practices nears its midway point, it's still too early to tell if U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta will side with the Justice Department and try to handcuff one of the world's most dominant tech companies.
If Mehta rules that Google has been running an illegal monopoly in search, the punishment could open up new online avenues for consumers and businesses to explore in pursuit of information, entertainment and commerce.
“The judge can compel Google to open the floodgates so more startups and third-party competitors can put greater competitive pressure on Google, which will create higher quality online services,” said Luther Lowe, senior vice president of public policy at Yelp. The online business review site has been one of Google's harshest critics while spending more than a decade railing against a strategy that favors its own services in search results.
Google's search engine earned its huge market share by almost instantaneously presenting people with helpful information culled from the billions of websites that have been indexed since former Stanford University graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed the technology during the late 1990s.
In addition to its technological wizardry, Google also pays billions of dollars each year to ensure its search engine is the default choice for answering queries entered in the world's most popular smartphones and web browsers.
These agreements don’t preclude users from switching to a different search engine in their settings, but it’s a tedious process that few people bother to navigate. This reality is why Google is willing to pay so much for the privileged position, according to the Justice Department.
Google's payments for preeminent search placement — including an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion per year to Apple alone — are at the head of the Justice Department's case, making it probable the judge would prohibit them if he rules against Google.
Should that happen, experts believe the most likely remedy in the U.S. would be a requirement for smartphones and web browsers to display a palette of different search engines during the setup process. That's something already being done in Europe, where all indications, so far, are that most people are still opting for Google.
That could be because they believe Google truly is the best search engine — as Google argues in their defense — or they just trust the brand more than rival options such as Microsoft's Bing or the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo.
No more passwords?Google looks to make passwords obsolete with passkeys
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella asserted Google has an almost hypnotic hold on users while testifying earlier this month during the trial.
“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,” Nadella said. He then added that the only way to break the habit is by changing the default choice.
As long as a ruling doesn't exclude Google's rivals from paying to be the automatic search engine on smartphones and web browsers, Microsoft could buy the default position for Bing — an opportunity Nadella indicated he would seize.
“There’s defaults — the only thing that matter in terms of changing search behavior,” Nadella testified.
Florian Schaub, associate professor of information at the University of Michigan, believes the fairest outcome in the trial would an across-the-board ban on all default agreements between two companies.
“The current environment is being shaped by an architecture that's designed by the big companies that control the space,” Schaub said. “What the government can do is inject some neutralism into this and give consumers some actual choices. If people still choose to use Google, that is at least a consumer choice, which would better than having people stick to a default because they are conditioned to that default.”
In his testimony during the trial, Apple executive Eddy Cue said the company has embraced Google as the preferred search engine on the iPhone and other products because it provides the best experience for its customers. That stance has raised speculation that if Apple is blocked from using Google as the default search engine on the iPhone, it might flex its muscle as the world's richest company to develop its own search technology.
However, a blanket ban on default search agreements that have been highly profitable for Apple and other companies such as wireless provider Verizon could trigger unintended consequences, such as raising prices on other popular products.
"If Google is no longer paying big bucks to Apple and other companies, they might raise the prices for their devices," said David Olson, an associate professor for the Boston College Law School who is following the antitrust trial. “I don't think they will be big, but we could see some price increases because Google has essentially been subsidizing the cost of devices like the iPhone.”
Another offshoot of a ban on default search agreements is that Google still could have a dominant advantage in search if people continue to proactively choose it and the company would have billions of dollars more to spend in other areas that it once devoted to deals that it really didn't need at all.
“Google must think they getting a great benefit from those default agreements, but maybe they're really not worth that much,” Olson said. “Maybe their cost/benefit analysis is off and they will wind up more money and just as much dominance. That would be ironic.”
Although the trial is focused on Google's search engine, a government victory could have more sweeping consequences across the technology industry if Mehta decided all default settings are anti-competitive and outlaws all defaults in the settings.
“If one of the outcomes of the trial is that there needs to be more neutral choices, it wouldn't just affect Google on Android phones, it could also affect Apple and the iPhone,” Schaub said. “Does it mean Google phones might have to offer (Apple's virtual assistant) Siri as an alternative to the Google Assistant? Or would Apple devices have to offer Google Assistant?”
A decision like that would open a crack in the digital wall that Apple has built around the iPhone to give its own software and certain pet products such as Siri exclusive access to the device's more than 1 billion users, setting the stage for another potential legal battle.
I received an email from a reader asking if hitting the “unsubscribe” button in her inbox is smart. Like many things in tech, it depends. In some cases, reacting to spammers might make your email a hot commodity, leading to more unwanted emails or even a spot on a “for sale” list.
Here’s the lowdown on how to stop getting emails you don’t want – without opening yourself up to more junk.
TryTech News and Hacks, the FREE newsletters read by 579,890 people who want helpful tech advice and are tired of tech news and tips meant for experts and coders. It’s easy to subscribe and easy to cancel!
It could go one of two ways
With reputable companies, clicking unsubscribe should do the trick. If you’re receiving newsletters or promotional emails from brands you know, they generally follow email marketing regulations.
For unsolicited spam from unknown senders? Clicking unsubscribe may indeed make things worse. You inadvertently confirm that your email address is active … possibly leading to even more spam.
‘How do I know what to pick, Kim?’
Stick to familiar ground: If the email is from a trusted source (think brands you’ve shopped with or newsletters you’ve signed up for), go ahead and hit that unsubscribe button.
Dodge the unknown: If it’s a random email about a long-lost prince or a miracle cure, steer clear of the unsubscribe link. Mark the email as spam in your email client.
For Outlook:
◾ Select the messages you want to report as junk.
◾ From the top toolbar, select Report > Report Junk.
For Apple Mail: 
For Gmail:
◾ On your computer, open Gmail.
◾ Select one or more emails.
◾ Click Report spam.
Use spam filters
For Outlook on Windows 10:
◾ At the top of the page, select Settings.
◾ Select Mail > Junk email.
◾ If you want to block an email address, enter the email address under Blocked senders and select Add. To block all emails from a domain, enter the domain name under Blocked Domains and select Add.
◾ Select Save.

To set up a filter using a spam email that you’ve received:
◾ Open Gmail.
◾ Check the checkbox next to the email you want. 
◾ Click More.
◾ Click Filter messages like these.
◾ Enter your filter criteria.
◾ Click Create filter.
Consider third-party tools
Sometimes, you need to bring in the big guns, especially if it’s an inbox you’ve had for years and years … and have shared with everyone under the sun.
◾ Unroll.Me: Handy for identifying and unsubscribing from multiple newsletters at once. This service is free to use.
◾ Clean Email: This organizer sorts emails and aids in unsubscribing. Plans start at $9.99 per month.

A family's outing to a wildlife center in Glen Rose, Texas came to a screeching halt last week when a giraffe slipped and fell onto their car's windshield, smashing it in the process.
Kari Hill was visiting the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center on Thursday with her teenage sons and infant granddaughter when the accident happened, FOX4NEWS reported.
Hill told the local news outlet that as they were touring the center, they stopped at the giraffe enclosure where a giraffe came and stuck his head in the sunroof as they fed him.
"We were laughing and loving it, until all of a sudden the giraffe appeared to lose his footing and fell onto the windshield of the car, and in the sunroof," Hill told Fox News. "Glass shot everywhere, all over us."
The visitor said that the entire family was covered in glass when the giraffe fell, and she feared that things were about to turn worse when the giraffe thankfully regained his footing and took off.
Hill quickly alerted the park's emergency hotline about the incident and pulled off to ensure that the children got the glass off them.
"What turned into a great family day, just cost me a huge car repair, and PTSD for us," Hill told Fox News.
However, she was grateful that things did not turn tragic.

Fossil Rim Wildlife Center is non-profit that specializes in captive breeding programs for indigenous and exotic endangered and threatened species. Guests can go on self-guided tours to see and feed some of the animals. However, visitors can only feed giraffes by hand. For other animals, the center recommends simply tossing the pellets onto the ground.
The Center did not respond to USA TODAY's request for a comment and update on the giraffe or the visitors. However, they told Fox News that the giraffe was not injured in the accident.

Eleven-year-old Ezekiel Zarate, couldn't wait to drive. Unfortunately, in his hometown of Treemonton, Utah, as in the rest of the state, you have to be 15 before you can get a learner permit to drive on public roads.
However, fortunately for Ezekiel, his loving dad, Michael, understood his impatience. So, when the opportunity arose to give his son a taster of what's to come, he took it.
Chancing on an empty private lot, he drove in and invited Ezekiel to take the wheel for his first driving lesson. And his son's reaction was a joy to behold.

Bryant, 42, is an Amazon Delivery Service Partner driver and was making a stop at the house on Oct. 7 when he saw the family that lives there gathered around their teenage son, Luke Breier. The teen was struggling to secure his tie, so Bryant stepped in to help.
Family members stood around smiling and laughing as he hyped the teenager up and made sure his tie was tidy and in place.
“You’re killing the game, young man,” Bryant said to the high school senior in a video shared online.
“He was clean. He reminded me of myself when I was coming up. That’s how I used to dress," said Bryant, who works for one of Amazon's third-party Delivery Service Partners, or companies that contract drivers to deliver packages. 
Bryant, a father of three sons and five girls, said he was passing along knowledge he had learned as a youngster himself. An avid churchgoer since his youth, he often dressed up in nice suits and attended with his mother, father and godparents.
So Bryant learned to tie a tie at the early age of 10. “All the brothers around me showed me how to,” he said.When he saw Breier struggling with his tie, Bryant felt like he should pay it forward.
Bryant’s story made it to the local news Monday and was covered by FOX 32 Chicago. His older sister called him to tell him about it.
“I didn't believe it at first but then I had other people calling me,” he said. “It made me feel good.”

Nicole Breier, the teenager’s mother, said Bryant did a great thing at a time where kind acts are needed.
“We live here in Chicago where racial tension is so high, especially in our neighborhood, which is known to be super racist,” she said. “It was just great to see two people reacting to each other regardless of color and that's the part that just really makes me happy.”
Her son, Luke Breier, said Bryant’s handiwork with his tie took his look to the next level. Bryant’s an awesome person for what he did, he said.
“It shows a lot about him,” Luke said. “It shows that he will go out his way to do something for someone else.”
Bryant said he was taught to love everybody and sees everyone as equal.
In addition to the suit the teen wore for homecoming, Luke also put on a flashy watch and Burberry cologne, which Bryant loved.
When he saw the teen in his homecoming gear, Bryant had nothing but good things to say.
“You got it,” he said. “You’re all the way clean. You’re all the way fresh.”

Lake Erie is now a world record holder!
The lake broke a world record over the weekend for the most waterspouts in a 24-hour period.
The International Centre for Waterspout Research announced that there were 181 waterspouts and funnel clouds observed over Lake Erie on Oct. 7, breaking the world waterspout record. According to the research center, one observer saw 72 waterspouts.
Users on X, formerly Twitter, shared photos and videos of the record-breaking waterspouts spotted over Lake Erie on Oct. 7.

Yes, cruise prices are up:Here's why cheap sailings may be harder to find
A waterspout is a whirling column of air and water mist, according to the National Ocean Service. They fall into two categories: Fair weather waterspouts, which usually form along the dark flat base of a line of developing cumulus clouds, or tornadic waterspouts, which are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water.
The National Weather Service issues a tornado warning if a waterspout moves on shore, as they could cause significant damage and injuries. Fair weather waterspouts typically dissipate rapidly once they reach land, rarely moving far inland.
The National Weather Service office in Buffalo, New York issued a special marine warning Oct. 7, warning of favorable conditions for waterspouts to form and later posted that waterspouts had been observed.
The U.S. ranks first for the most waterspout sightings, according to the International Centre for Waterspout Research, accounting for 41.7% of all waterspouts sighted. Italy ranks second, at 10.2%. As of Monday, the research center reported have been 1,615 waterspouts observed around the world this year.
Great news, America. Criminal defendant and leading GOP presidential primary candidate Donald Trump has something new to whine about – a partial gag order placed on him by the federal judge in his election interference case.
If you thought Trump’s yearslong journey to become the sorest of sore losers by ceaselessly braying about the 2020 presidential election he lost was growing tiresome, just you wait. Monday’s order provides fresh fodder for his persecution cannon, which I’m sure will be red hot from firing as the former president processes the fact that he, like anyone facing criminal charges, can’t freely intimidate witnesses, prosecutors or court personnel.
In issuing the order, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said: “Mr. Trump can certainly claim he’s being unfairly prosecuted, but I cannot imagine any other case where a defendant is allowed to call the prosecution ‘deranged,’ a ‘thug’ or anything else.”
She added: “His political campaign does not give him carte blanche to vilify public servants for simply doing their job.”
Setting aside the remarkable fact that a federal judge sees credible concerns that the far-and-away front-runner for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination is attempting to intimidate witnesses and prosecutors in his own criminal case, consider the way we’d expect Trump to respond to Chutkan’s decision.
Something along the lines of: “A CRAZY RADICAL LEFTIST MARXIST TRUMP-HATING ‘JUDGE’ has now totally violated my CONSTITUTIONAL rights by issuing a ‘gag order’ on me in what everyone knows is ELECTION INTERFERENCE led by Crazy Joe Biden and his boss, Barack HUSSEIN Obama. FIGHT BACK!”
I made that all up, but would you be surprised if Trump wrote something similar? And if you wouldn't be surprised, doesn't that suggest we're facing a serious problem?
Immediately after the ruling, Trump posted on Truth Social: "A TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED TO DEMOCRACY TODAY – GAG ORDER!" and "WILL APPEAL THE GAG ORDER RULING. WITCH HUNT!"
There's little doubt the angry rants will get worse.
Be honest Republican voters.Is Trump really what you want?
Prior to the gag order, Trump had labeled special counsel Jack Smith “a crackhead” and called him “psycho.”
In August, Trump posted what prosecutors viewed as a threat against witnesses, writing: “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU!”
And in a Sept. 22 post on Truth Social, Trump accused retired Gen. Mark Milley, a former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and now a witness in the election interference case, of treason and suggested that he should be executed.
Prosecutors, in their filing requesting a gag order, wrote that “no other criminal defendant would be permitted to issue public statements insinuating that a known witness in his case should be executed; this defendant should not be, either.”
Judge muzzles Trump:McCarthy booted from House speaker, Trump gagged. The Republican Party is an unserious mess.
Trump will squeal desperately and claim his free-speech rights are being trampled, but even a low-functioning mollusk would know that’s nonsense.
Trump was president, true. He isn’t anymore.
Trump is running for president, true. But that doesn’t give him the freedom to say whatever the hell he wants about people involved in the multiple criminal cases in which he faces 91 state and federal felony charges.
I’m not above the law, you’re not above the law and Trump, sad as it may be for him to learn, is not above the law.
But at least now he has some new material to work with. When your very essence is defined by aggrievement, a legal setback provides fresh paint for your victimhood self-portrait.
Let’s see how long it takes the whiner in chief to violate the judge’s gag order. I’m guessing it comes in 3, 2, 1 …

A Florida judge who was a prosecutor in the Casey Anthony trial and a former state attorney has been accused of child abuse, according to Governor Ron DeSantis.
Judge Jeffrey Ashton of the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court, which includes Orlando, is facing allegations of "lewd and lascivious molestation on a child under 16" and failure to report child abuse, according to an executive order by Gov. DeSantis issued Oct. 11.
State Attorney Andrew Bain notified DeSantis of the allegations, according to the executive order, which reassigned the investigation and potential prosecution to the Tenth Circuit State Attorney to avoid a conflict of interest. Bain was appointed as state attorney in August after DeSantis ousted Democrat Monique Worrell.
WFTV reported that the Winter Park Police Department confirmed that they are investigating the allegations, but no charges have been brought against Ashton.
A representative from Bain's office declined to elaborate on the allegations and how Bain became aware of them, saying that criminal cases originate with law enforcement. Bain's office directed all questions to the Tenth Judicial Circuit. The Tenth Judicial Circuit and the Tenth Circuit State Attorney did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Ashton's office directed questions to a private attorney, who also was not available for comment Monday morning.
Where is Casey Anthony now?:About the acquitted suspect in her daughter's death
Ashton is a former state attorney. He was elected in 2012, but he lost his seat in 2016, as reported by the Orlando Sentinel.
He came into office after making a name for himself as a lead prosecutor on the Casey Anthony murder trial.
While in office as state attorney, he was embroiled in controversy for frequenting Ashley Madison, a website primarily used by married people looking to have a discreet affair, as reported by the Orlando Sentinel.
He was elected to the judicial bench in 2018, serving on domestic violence cases from 2019-2020 before his current assignment on civil cases.
Hate crime investigation:Stabbing death of 6-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois to be investigated as hate crime
The violence in the Middle East has come to the American Midwest in the most gruesome fashion.
On Sunday, in a Chicago suburb, Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old American Muslim child of Palestinian descent, was fatally stabbed 26 times by his 71-year old landlord in what police allege is a hate crime. Wadea’s mother, stabbed multiple times as well, is still in serious condition in the hospital.
I cannot get the picture that has been circulating of young Wadea wearing his "Happy Birthday" hat out of my mind. It reminds me so much of my two boys when they were his age.
I fear that this is not going to be the only incident of the Israel-Hamas war having violent reverberations in the United States.
The principal of my son’s high school, a large and diverse institution on the north side of Chicago, sent out a message to all families saying she was concerned about violence in the school as a result of the war that began Oct. 7. At Columbia University in New York, a 24-year-old Israeli student was beaten while hanging flyers condemning the Hamas attack.
Who is going to hold America together? Because it sure feels like we are coming apart.
For years now we have been dangerously divided over controversial issues such as abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Now the conflict in the Middle East is creating new tensions in the United States.
Calling all athletic coaches, hospital nurses, elementary school teachers, high school principals, volunteer managers, small business owners and theater directors. America is relying on you.
If you have a diverse school or team or staff, they very likely disagree on some fundamental things, such as the conflict in the Middle East. Without minimizing the importance of their varying loyalties, your role as a leader is to focus their attention on working together on the task at hand, whether that is preparing food at a restaurant or fighting fires together in your community or playing hockey together on a team. 
We survived the Hamas attack.But now the blockade on Gaza haunts our interfaith group.
If you need some inspiration on the path of holding America together: Watch "Remember The Titans" starring Denzel Washington.
The movie, released in 2000, takes place in 1971, after T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, was fully integrated. The prior year, a Black teenager was killed by a white store clerk over the alleged theft of razor blades, touching off days of race riots. Tensions were high, and racial injustice ran deep. 
Then Black and white high school football players boarded buses to preseason training camp, led by newly appointed Black head coach Herman Boone.
Boone enjoyed telling people that he was not Martin Luther King Jr., Jesus Christ or the Easter Bunny – he was just a football coach. His job was not to affect the broader racial tensions in the society; it was simply to coach a winning football team. But to have a winning football team, he needed to make sure that the racial tensions in the society didn’t affect his players.
He paired Black and white athletes together as roommates and required them to learn some facts about one another. Mostly, he relied on the game of football to teach his players that they needed to work together. The white offensive linemen better block for the Black quarterback, or he’s not going to have time to throw a pass. The white receiver better catch the pass from that Black quarterback, or the team is not going to score touchdowns.
The movie is cheesy in parts, but it carries a powerful message: Our society’s strength is in the institutions that bring people of diverse identities and divergent ideologies together to cooperate on concrete activities with common aims.
And it is in the leaders who focus people on the areas of cooperation, even amid our wider conflicts.
So who is going to hold America together? The answer is: you.
You don’t just have an inspiring Denzel Washington movie on your side; there is academic research supporting this approach. In the social psychology study called the "Robbers Cave Experiment," researchers found that the best way to dissipate conflict between rival groups was to give them concrete activities on which to cooperate.
They also found that the longer diverse people cooperated, the more their identities shifted: from adversaries to friends.
Overwhelmed by the war in Israel?Here's how to protect your mental health.
And that new identities for some can have wider implications for all. In "Remember The Titans," as the integrated football team wins games, the broader Alexandria community finds its own racial tensions easing. Black and white families start sitting together in the stands, forming friendships, building a collective identity as Alexandria – not just Black Alexandria and white Alexandria.
It is a picture of America at its best.
We can appreciate this, because we know how ugly the alternative is. 
In the most powerful scene in the film, coach Boone takes his team on a grueling early morning run. They arrive at the destination just as the sun is coming up and are shocked to be looking at gravestones. It is Gettysburg, the battlefield turned cemetery where tens of thousands of Americans died in one of the most famous battles of the Civil War.
Coach Boone tells his team, “Take a lesson from the dead. If we don’t come together right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed.”  
Of course, it was on that same site that President Abraham Lincoln gave the Gettysburg Address, which ended with the famous lines: “This nation, under God, will have a new birth of freedom – and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.” 
The American people hail from every race, religion and nation on this earth. To achieve the goal that President Lincoln placed before us, we need to follow the path of coach Boone and realize that we need to cooperate across our differences, not let them divide us.

Former All-Pro wide receiver Antonio Brown has been arrested in Broward County, Florida for allegedly failing to pay child support. Per records from the Broward County Sheriff's Department, the former Pittsburgh Steeler was arrested near midnight Sunday on an out-of-county warrant. Already, he has been released on a $15,000 bond.
Wiltrice Jackson, the mother of Brown's eldest daughter, told TMZ Brown owes more than $30,000 in child support. A warrant had been put out for Brown's arrest for failure to make child support payments back in August, CBS reported.
Jackson also stated that she wants to see Brown arrested for what he's done to her and their daughter. "Right now, he’s making a mockery out of the judge, out of everything, because he feels like he’s untouchable," Jackson told TMZ.
Jackson's attorney, Pascal Michel, stated that his client also wants Brown to be more involved in the girl's life. According to Jackson, the teen has drawn interest from over 80 colleges and universities for her excellence in track and field.
Brown also has five other children with his ex-fiancé.

NFL Week 7:Picks and Predictions
Republican presidential hopefuls came to New Hampshire last week and answered questions directly from voters in a series of town hall forums. Some of their responses checked out, but other claims were false or misleading.
Five candidates took part in the forums presented by USA TODAY, the USA TODAY Network and Seacoastonline at the Exeter Town Hall, where Donald Trump, Barack Obama and many other former presidents have campaigned.
Topics ranged from energy and the environment to taxes and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Here's where the candidates were on – and off – the mark:
“I’ve been to Kensington, in the inner city of Philadelphia. You know what happens there? The aid programs, including funded by the government, hand out crack pipes and needles as a form of aid.” 
This claim by Vivek Ramaswamy, a tech entrepreneur and political newcomer, is only half true.
Like many communities around the country, Philadelphia has a needle exchange program that provides clean needles for drug users to slow the spread of disease.
"Clean needles are an evidence-based intervention proven to save lives, included in the White House’s recommendations for addressing the overdose epidemic," Sarah Peterson, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Mayor's Office, told USA TODAY in an email.

The city’s website notes the benefits of such programs in preventing the spread of infections including hepatitis C and HIV. But the website makes no mention of offering crack pipes – because there's no such program.
Peterson said the city distributes safe smoking kits, but those do not include pipes.
It echoes a similar claim that USA TODAY debunked in 2022, which asserted that President Joe Biden’s administration was spending $30 million on crack pipes as part of its program to reduce health risks tied to drug use. The program allowed for grantees to purchase safe smoking kits, but crack pipes were not among the approved materials. 
“25% fatherlessness rate in this country. Yes, we ought to have empathy for kids who grow up in those households, who are eight times more likely to end up in prison, 10 times more likely to end up in poverty, over 10 times less likely to graduate from high school and enter and get a college degree.” 
The fatherlessness statistic Ramaswamy cited matches 2022 data from the U.S. Census Bureau that found about a quarter of the 73 million children under 18 living without fathers in the home.
There's less clarity about exactly how much more likely other negative outcomes are as a result, though research shows the lack of a father figure increases the chances of other negative life outcomes.

The Census Bureau in 2020 found that children in fatherless households were four times more likely to be in poverty, well short of the 10 times cited by Ramaswamy.
Other studies we found used slightly different metrics, confirming a correlation but with different figures.
"We cut taxes more than any other administration in history."
This claim by former Vice President Mike Pence is false. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by then-President Donald Trump in December 2017. An analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget determined "it would definitely not be the largest in history," but would instead be the eighth-largest as a percent of gross domestic product since 1918 and the fourth-largest in inflation-adjusted dollars.
More:US government shutdowns used to be rare. That’s increasingly no longer the case.
The Washington Post found Trump's tax cut amounted to nearly 0.9% of GDP, which means Trump's tax cut was smaller than tax cuts passed under several previous administrations. For instance, the Economic Recovery Act of 1981 passed under President Ronald Reagan was 2.89% of GDP. By the same measurement, Trump's tax cut was also smaller than two tax cuts passed under his predecessor, President Barack Obama.
"The virus came from a Chinese lab."
Some polls show many Americans believe COVID-19 leaked from a lab, but Pence's assertion is still far from settled.
The White House said in February there was not a consensus across the government on the origins of the virus, as USA TODAY reported at the time. That announcement followed reports that the Energy Department had concluded the pandemic most likely was caused by an unintentional lab leak in China. However, the department's conclusion was made with “low confidence,” meaning the level of certainty was not high, according to the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.

Biden had previously asked intelligence agencies to investigate the origins of the virus, but they were not able to reach a consensus, according to The Washington Post, which noted that most of the agencies favored, with "low confidence," the "natural spillover" theory.
NPR reported in February that scientists who have studied the origins of the pandemic are far less divided, saying there is "very convincing" data and "overwhelming evidence" to indicate an animal origin.
“I'll always fight for transparency (in political spending), for you to see everything in government and otherwise. I did that in South Carolina, I did it at the U.N. I think you need to see everything that is possible to see and then you can make the best decision.”
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s response to a question about political spending fails to note that she has specifically fought against donor transparency for her own political nonprofit.
Haley was asked about how to counteract the influence of big money donors in politics, and she said donors to political action committees and candidates must be disclosed, and that identifying large financial backers can help voters recognize potential influences.
More:Biden raises $71 million in 3rd quarter, far outpacing Trump and the Republican field
However, Haley founded a political nonprofit after leaving the Trump administration called Stand for America. As a 501(c)(4) organization, it has the option to keep donors’ names private. It did so, but Politico obtained an unredacted tax filing for the nonprofit from 2019 that identified dozens of donors who had not given to Haley’s PAC of the same name, where their donations would have been public.
Haley called the release a violation of tax law and threatened to sue the New York attorney general’s office because the released version of the filing had a marking indicating the office had been in possession of that copy. USA TODAY could not find any media reports saying the lawsuit had been filed.
Open Secrets reported that Haley’s nonprofit raised more than $25 million in the four-plus years between its founding and when she joined the presidential race. The nonprofit’s funds cannot be used for a campaign, but it is a way of staying connected to donors and funding policy promotion efforts between campaigns.
"Now in South Carolina, when someone leaves the fence, they have a job to go to the next day. We have the lowest recidivism rate in the country.”
The claim is statistically correct, and the rate improved during the Haley administration, according to media reports. South Carolina’s recidivism rate – defined as the percentage of prisoners released who return to state custody within three years – is a nation-leading 19%, according to a study by the Virginia Department of Corrections. Other studies with different definitions also place recidivism around 20%.

While governor, Haley introduced programs to prepare inmates for life after incarceration. Those changes included job training, help with housing and other support services, steps that continued after she left office. State officials credit that approach with keeping former inmates from reoffending.
“President Biden canceled the oil leases from the Alaskan slope. This is after leases have been made. I will immediately open those lands back up for leasing so we can produce oil and we can get the price down at the pump.”
This is not an accurate description of what Biden did. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson appears to be conflating a pair of actions taken by the Department of Interior on Sept. 6. The agency proposed a rule that would reduce the acreage available for drilling on Alaska’s North Slope while also canceling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
The changes on the slope would not cancel any existing leases but would close off 10.6 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska from being used for drilling for oil. The slope produced nearly 500,000 barrels of oil daily in 2022, about a quarter of its peak in 2008.
More:Alaska oil drilling: Willow project critics go viral with petition pressuring Biden
No private companies held the leases canceled in the Arctic refuge, an area of environmentally-sensitive federal land in Alaska, according to the Associated Press. Nine leases were awarded at a 2021 auction, but an energy company and a real estate company both canceled their leases in 2022, according to media reports. The remaining leases were all held by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a corporation owned by the state government. Alaska officials expressed interest in partnering with oil companies to develop and drill the land when it won the auctions, but that hasn't happened yet.
If Hutchinson meant to say opening up Arctic leases, their impact on gasoline prices is purely hypothetical. The Energy Information Administration said in a 2018 report that it could take 10 years after leases are issued before oil from the refuge would enter the market because more studies must be performed, and infrastructure must be built.
“Right now, I could not put in a work requirement, which I tried to do in Arkansas, that if you’re able-bodied and you don’t have small children at home, then you have to work or you have to be in worker training or you have to volunteer.”
This claim is largely accurate.
Thirteen states received waivers during the Trump administration to institute work requirements for at least some people in their Medicaid programs, although Arkansas was the only one to drop people from the program for non-compliance, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. The others either paused implementation or held off on enforcing the requirements because of threats of litigation or the COVID-19 pandemic.
More:Helpers few and far between for rural Americans kicked off Medicaid after pandemic
But the Biden administration revoked all waivers in 2021, pointing in part to a federal report that found work requirements in Arkansas – even before the pandemic – did not increase employment and caused about 18,000 Arkansans to lose coverage.
However, Georgia won a court fight last year to implement a work requirement as part of a Medicaid expansion effort, applying the requirement only to people who become eligible for Medicaid under expanded criteria. That program began on July 1 but was not a new waiver under Biden.

"The United States has taken more CO2 out of the air than any other country in the world."
This claim by North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is true in terms of absolute numbers, but there's more to the story.
The U.S. reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by about 760 million metric tons per year from 2000-14, according to a 2018 report from the bipartisan Environmental and Energy Study Institute – the most recent version available. The drop was about four times as large as the one in the United Kingdom, which ranked second with an annual cut of 170 million metric tons.
More:Visualizing climate change's wrath: Global warming's dire impact on Earth explored
But because the U.S. is also one of the world’s top carbon dioxide producers, that represents a relatively small percentage drop of 8%. The report says most countries had cuts of at least 10%. Denmark trimmed its emissions by 30%.
“We cut $1.7 billion out of our state budget in my first four months in office. … We know how to balance budgets.”
His figure is right, but he left out some important context by taking credit for it.
Those cuts early in Burgum's term came when lower oil and commodity prices led to drops in revenue, according to a report by InForum. The budget assembled by Burgum and state lawmakers in 2017 cut state general fund spending from $6 billion to $4.3 billion.

But Burgum may be taking too much credit for that balanced budget. The state constitution explicitly requires lawmakers and the governor to approve a balanced budget every two years.

A Georgia man got the shock of his life when received a $1.4 million speeding ticket. Fortunately for him, the figure was just a placeholder.
Connor Cato told Savannah-based WSAV-TV that the Georgia State Patrol pulled him over for driving 90 mph in a 55-mph zone on Sept. 2.
Though Cato was expecting to get a so-called "super speeder" ticket, never in his wildest dreams did he think that it would be for over $1 million.
When he called the court thinking the figure was a typo, he was told that he should either pay the fine or appear in court in December.
“‘$1.4 million,’ the lady told me on the phone," Cato told the station. "I said, ‘This might be a typo,’ and she said, ‘No sir, you either pay the amount on the ticket or you come to court on Dec. 21 at 1:30 p.m.'"
Semi-truck driver killed:Train derailment closes down I-25 in Colorado
Savannah city government spokesman Joshua Peacock told USA TODAY on Monday that Cato's fine is just a placeholder.
"A speeding ticket can only be set by a judge in a court appearance and cannot exceed $1,000 plus state mandated cost," he said.
While Cato still has to appear in court and is considered a "super speeder," he will not have to pay $1.4 million in fine.
Under Savannah law, "super speeders" are anyone caught driving more than 35 mph above the speed limit. Super speeders have to appear in court, where a judge will determine the actual fine.
Peacock explained that because super speeders are required to go to court, the e-citation software automatically puts in a $999,999 base amount plus state-mandated costs. That ended up coming to $1.4 million for Cato.

The court is currently adjusting the placeholder language in order to avoid any future confusion, Peacock said.
"The city did not implement the placeholder amount in order to force or scare people into court," the City of Savannah said in a statement to WSAV-TV. "The programmers who designed the software used the largest number possible because super speeder tickets are a mandatory court appearance and do not have a fine amount attached to them when issued by police."

Kim Ng, the first woman to serve as general manager of a Major League Baseball team, will not return to the Miami Marlins after she declined a mutual option on her contract for the 2024 season, owner Bruce Sherman announced Monday.
Ng, who led the Marlins to their first full-season playoff berth since 2003 this season with a series of moves to improve the club’s flagging offense at the trade deadline, was hired after the 2020 season by club CEO Derek Jeter, who played for the New York Yankees while she was an assistant GM there.
ESPN reported that Sherman sought to hire a president of baseball operations above Ng, effectively shifting her from the No. 1 position in the department to No. 2. Ng did not return a message seeking comment.
Jeter resigned as CEO in February 2021, citing differences with Sherman. Ng continued tinkering with the club, and in January 2022 traded No. 2 starter Pablo Lopez for reigning American League batting champion Luis Arraez in hopes of balancing the club and hired manager Skip Schumaker.
Arraez hit close to .400 for most of the first half, and deadline deals to land slugger Josh Bell and third baseman Jake Burger helped the club secure the second of three wild-card spots. The Marlins were swept in their NL wild-card series by Philadelphia.

Ng served as an assistant general manager with the Chicago White Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers and Yankees, and worked in Major League Baseball’s central office before Jeter hired her. Sherman said the club had picked up her option for the 2024 season earlier this year.
Declining her mutual option comes during a traditional period of job movement in baseball, though the only top baseball operations job open now is hte Boston Red Sox. The New York Mets are seeking a GM, but that person would serve under newly hired president of baseball operations David Stearns, formerly the Brewers' GM.

Columns typically run 550 to 750 words. They should be pasted directly into an email and sent to theforum@usatoday.com. Pieces should include links (URLs, not headlines or footnotes) to back up quotes and factual material. People featured in columns must be identified by their real, full names.
We do not publish open letters, class projects or material that has been submitted to multiple outlets. Rebuttals to editorials and columns published in USA TODAY should be submitted as letters to the editor, not as full-length op-eds.
Due to the volume of submissions, we can’t respond to all columns sent to us. If our Opinion team is interested in yours, you will hear from us within three business days.
Submissions may be edited for accuracy, clarity, style, standards and length. 
Please include with your submission a short biography, two sentences at most, to run at the end of your column, as well as a current photograph, to which you own publishing rights. If you or a business, trade group or other institution with which you are associated stands to gain financially or in any other way from your column, you should disclose that information in detail. In most cases, it should also be included in the body of the piece or in the author's biographical information.
Columns are accepted for online publication; print publication is not guaranteed. All columns published by USA TODAY are available for use online and in print by the more than 250 properties in the USA TODAY Network. They include Austin; Bergen County, New Jersey; Burlington, Vermont; Cincinnati; Columbus, Ohio; Des Moines; Detroit; El Paso, Texas; Indianapolis; Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Milwaukee; Nashville, Tennessee; Phoenix, Reno, Nevada; Palm Beach, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware.
Authors may post their columns elsewhere 48 hours after they are published at USA TODAY. By submitting a column to USA TODAY and agreeing to its publication, authors are granting exclusive rights to the piece to the USA TODAY Network for 48 hours and non-exclusive rights thereafter.
